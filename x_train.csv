"Ok I'm kinda getting scared now I went to Walmart to go buy a soccer ball which is in the sports section (duh) and right next to the sport section is the gun section (merica) and there was a line of around 9 persons to buy guns.

 This was in Houston Texas by the way"
"Iâm tempted to see if I can go a day without being on Reddit But also Iâm pretty addicted to it so I donât think I would be able to do that but I also kinda wanna try so Iâm going to try. 

I know nobody really cares but Iâm gonna be off reddit for 24 hours (unless I fail which would be pretty pathetic) starting at 12:00, so in about 30 minutes.

So goodbye for a bit."

"If you love someone romantically and they spend time with you that they could be spending elsewhere, whatâs stopping you from asking them out?! Seriously people always talk about how they are in love with someone but theyâre too scared of rejection- I say this from experience, if you wait too long the only thing thatâll come from it is pain. Iâm painfully aware of all of the people that say things like: âI donât have the confidenceâ or, âI donât want to lose her as a friend.â The truth is that if you ever want to gain confidence, you must push past your limits and go further. 
     
Also, ask yourself this: will you be happy being just friends with someone you are madly in love with? If so, move on, if no, tell her!

Thatâs most of what I wanted to say but if anyone wants to talk about this privately shoot me a DM, or whatever you feel like doing.

Edit: Iâm only saying this because I feel like this is a common problem I have overcome and hope I can help many others overcome, as well as the fact that Iâm going to move on this step fairly soon with a girl I'm into, wish me luck and good luck to you all!"

"Bf wants to die, so do i.Weâre both depressed as shit. Previous suicide attempts. I could honestly go on with him by my side if he was okay. He canât work a job or go out or eat barely. Heâs stopped self harming because he canât even feel pain anymore. I still have my emotions and I can cry and whatnot but I canât go on without him. He has saved my life before, he gives me a will to live. 

I know itâs toxic. I donât have friends and Iâve given up so donât tell me to keep looking, thereâs no shared values or connections. I always hear âafter a breakup it feels impossible but you will move on.â And iâve been through that with my ex. I tried killing myself multiple times and though e dated for 7 months it took me a year to get over him, and fuck was it painful it destroyed me. I know I canât go through that same pain of losing someone again, and plus this time it would be 10000x worse. He means the world to me. If a dog is suffering so much youâd put him out of his misery, my quality of life wonât be livable. Iâm considering a double suicide or some shit right now. I feel so guilty watching him in agony and itâs tearing us both down. The worst part is weâre still so in love but thatâs not enough to keep holding on. My choice is breakup with him and I know heâd kill himself. Or if I stay with him until he eventually does, thereâs not way Iâd be able to go on. Sure itâs co-dependant but when life is awful heâs the only good thing. I canât stop crying and panicking and i canât fucking breathe. 

All I can picture is us lying down in a bed and dying together. I promise Iâm not romanticizing it, it scares the shit out of me that this thought is the only thing soothing me. I donât know how weâd do it. My worst fear is us overdosing and me surviving and seeing him dead. Weâve been through hospitals and psych wards, everything always comes back down. Itâs been years and nothing has changed. I need a way we can both leave consciousness."

"Can we for once look at what we can try for our situation?Don't get me wrong, I really want to die too and when I'm at my lowest, all I want to do is just get out of this whole reality but I also happened to be one of those people who are procrastinating on killing myself.

This subreddit is great to rant or let out those feelings but can we for once talk about suggestions on how to make baby steps? It's not possible to get out of this mental rut but I think we as a community understands the struggle best and it would be good to know what worked and how we can learn from those who tried. 

I know people who doesn't understand what we experience make dumb statements like ""call the hot line"" or ""just do it, why cant you just do it"" but I don't expect them to understand either. It's not on them for being wired differently just like how it's not on us to not have the ability to function the same way normal people do."

I'm in so much pain and tired of hurtingI'm 22 years old. I never went to college. I don't have a car. I live with my parents. I only have one friend and she lives an hour away from me. My boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me because I wouldn't get help. I am now in therapy and on antidepressants but I still feel the same. It hurts so much knowing he is with another girl. He wants to be friends but I don't know how much longer I can stand it. I'm trying so hard to get better but I'm so alone. I stopped cutting for him. The nights are getting worse. My thoughts telling me to kill myself. Its my fault I'm not getting better. Its my fault I'm not happy. I have to punish myself. My family knows about me but can't help me. I'm so lost without him. I don't know what to do. I've messed things up too much. I talk to him every day but I miss him so much.
"I know itâs TikTok, but could you help me out We have this thing where I live that is like a teenager community thing, and we are currently having a competition where we made one TikTok each, and the one with the most likes gets a prize, so if you would be so kind as to help a fellow teenager out by liking [this post](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSa43Ab5/), that would be very much appreciated"

"Pixar needs to be stopped Every single movie. At the beginning. The lamp (Luxo Jr.) hops on over, hovering over the letter âIâ. Then, without mercy, he jumps and repeatedly stomps the âIâ until he is crushed. The âIâ has been abused for many years, or it is a different âIâ every time, replacing the dead one from the last movie. This is something we have been witnessing and have done nothing about over the past few decades. 

This lamp has commuted assault and possibly even murder right in front of children and nobody has done anything. Every day we stray further away from god."

"This is probably pointless to even post...I have been depressed for the last four years. (I'm 17) I'm not talking about the teenage depression, I've tried several times to take my own life. I've either pussied out, or I didn't succeed in it.

The reason that I've been so depressed lately is because of a girl. (I met her over the internet)Shes my dream girl. Long curly brown hair, the most stunning look in her eyes, amazing smile, extremely soothing voice, and a personality just as unbelievable. We hit it off great, talking as much as we could, video chatting, phone convorsations, everything. We decided that we should meet up. I busted my ass to get the money to see her, and on the day before I was supposed to go up there, she calls it off. I was devistated to say the least. I did all of that work, all of the planning to meet the girl of my dreams just to have her call it off the day before.

A month of depression slowly creeps by of no contact between us (our phones were messing up and didn't know it)until around five days ago she messages me on Skype again. We IM'd for a while and then got off. Yesterday we got on the cam again until five in the morning until she fell asleep talking to me. I got to thinking about how easy it is to lose her again. Being long distance, all she has to do is stop talking to me and it would be over.

What really drove me over the edge was something that she brought up last night. She told me that a couple of days before we started talking again she met up with some random guy. Normally this wouldn't seem like a big deal to anybody else, but its a sore subject with us. She knows that I get jealous really easily and told me that she wouldn't really talk about to with me bcause of that. She told me that the first time that we talked because we had a thing going. After she told me about it, it made me realize that I had been friendzoned. That has depressed me sooo much that I feel like I can't take it anymore. I already have a suicide plan and I'm going to write a short but meaningful suicide note to her and a couple of other people. All I'm waiting for is the gears to be set into motion.

I apologize in advance if this is hard to follow, I can't really think straight right now and my thoughts are scattered."
"I constantly thinks about suicide like a solutionAt this point i have no idea why I'm making this post but each day i find myself contemplating suicide more and more,asking myself if i should do it or not and every single day I'm thinking about it.
For those that are going to ask i do am taking medications. (However i don't think they work) And also talking to a therapist. (But he doesn't know about these toughts)
What should i do?"
"Give me one reason to keep existing""Because people will miss you!""

I don't fucking care if people miss me. I'm a fucking asshole who probably wouldn't care if they all died. I just mooch of them anyway so I'd only be sad that I lost shit when they're dead. They don't matter to me anyway.

I've nothing to offer the world and my loved ones are slowly leaving me due to disappointment. I'm just gonna end up a worthless NEET taking from the world and offering nothing back.

Even by asking for help I'm wasting time that could be going to other people. If I kill myself now I'll never have anyone hurt by me again. I only hurt and take from people, I shouldn't exist."
"Feeling pretty low tonight because of my acne and how I look...I have had acne since I was 10 years old.

How can my friends/boyfriend/family not throw up in disgust when they look at my raw face? Or when they touch my skin? How are they not embarrassed of me...?

"iâm tiredIâm tired of peoples fake sympathy. Iâm tired of begging for help only for it to fall on deaf ears. Iâm just plain tired. I havenât slept in a week. I canât sleep. Iâm tired of being told to go to therapy and get on meds for the third time. They donât work. Nothing has worked. Thousands of dollars of my own money and several years of my time wasted on useless coping strategies that donât work and talking about my nonexistent feelings. I donât remember what it feels like to have genuine emotions. I just want to feel anything. Iâm tired of being numb. Iâve put up with the nothingness for a long time and I think Iâm about to just call it quits. No warnings, no notes, just me, a bottle of scotch, and a deer slug to my brain stem."

"My favorite singer committed suicide two days ago and I might tooMy favorite singer of all time, Jonghyun, committed suicide two days ago.

I canât believe this is happening. I canât believe this is happening. I canât breathe. I hate that he brought happiness to so many people and he wasnât happy himself. I canât believe this.

His smile got me through days that I couldnât find the motivation to get up and go to school. His songs made me feel better when nothing else could. I was a fan since I was twelve years old. I grew up listening to him.

I canât believe this is happening. I just want to rewind time. I donât want to be here, in this world, where Kim Jonghyun isnât alive. I wish he was happy. I wish someone had helped him.This isnât fair. I want to die too. Please someone talk to me Iâm scared I might hurt myself...Iâm 16f by the way"

"I'm tired of thisI am so lonely. It's impossible for me to make a connection with anybody. I can't even blame other people because others have tried to talk to me but after a few days I just block their number. Being around other people makes me so fucking nervous but I hate being alone. I hold people to ridiculously high standards and of course everybody lets me down.


I am a spoilt piece of shit, I am disgusting, I am rude, I am stupid. I have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I spend all of my time daydreaming about having a social circle or having a boyfriend but this just upsets me further because it's never going to fucking happen. I am so lonely, I cry all the time, I don't know how to feel better.


I just want to be normal, I want to be happy, I'm so tired of being like this. Nobody cares about me and why should they? I am not worthy of life, I am so done with trying to sustain this miserable existence. I am done. Nobody cares, I am so unimportant and insignificant. I really fucking hate everything about myself, I can't see a way out of this apart from just fucking ending it all. I'm sorry for posting here, I just don't know what to do, I am so lonely."

Sometimes, he hurts you so badly you just want to end it. You just want to end your life. You want to see if after everything, would he care. It is so stupid, but there you are wanting to end your life because of this stupid guy. You want to walk out to a vehicle and allow it to knock you out. You want to head over to the highest floor and plunge. I don't know why. You are so stupid. You know you can do better, yet you are subjecting yourself to all this. You know it yourself that your own fucking emotions are unstable as hell. This wasnt the first time you fantasise about death. You keep putting yourself in situations that only add onto your mess."

"Where to begin.A brief summary. 

I am an early twenties, Caucasian, male, living in a rented house with my partner and my 3 year old daughter and a 10 year old dog. I am unemployed, and am supposed to be 2 years into a 3 year university degree. I live in a first world nation and have no physical disabilities. 

I have a serious gambling problem. I have sought help, and am being lead towards cognitive behavioural therapy as a solution. I have spent approximately 8-10k of my own money and approximately 6-7k of my family's money. I have also just recently maxed out two low limit credit cards and cannot afford to pay my daughters nursery fees. I am seriously in debt. I haven't told anyone. 

In the autumn of 2014 I agreed to undertake a 3 year course to further my career prospects. In February of 2015 I stopped going and didn't tell anyone. I have no idea why. I was allowed to retake this first year of this course and started in September of last year. I haven't attended a single lecture. I am going to be asked to leave next week and have racked up approximately 30-40k of student loan debt. No one has any idea. 

I have applied for a job at a bank, if I get this things might turn around. If I don't, I have no idea what to do. 

There's more. I'm just struggling to compose all of my thoughts right now. 

I spend everyday waking up filled with sadness. Going to bed filled with sadness. I do almost nothing all day. I have no motivation. No appetite. No desire for anything. 

My partner resents me for some lies I told in the past. We do not have a loving relationship. She has a decent job and has made a good go of herself. I am very proud of her. 

I don't know if I want to be helped. So I don't know why I'm posting on here. I'm so very and completely lost. "

"Assessing the oddsHi guys, I'm a 25 y/o American woman. I was abused as a kid and I've cut off my family, so a lot of the times living feels pretty lonely. There's a strong chance my (abusive) mom had BPD or bipolar disorder, and I think there's a strong possibility that I have BPD now. I'm erratic, dramatic, needy, clingy-- I scare off potential partners before they're with me for even a year, I dump my emotions on people only to apologize and grovel afterwards for them not to leave me alone.

The last guy, he knew about all my trauma and all my past and he said we would stick together, no problem. He left me over the weekend. Every part of me that could have started to trust a person is dead, I have no more left in me

I hate myself. I know I am a piece of shit because I put all of my feelings on people. There is nowhere else for me to put these feelings; nothing works and when I try to explain my situation to people I get no sympathy and no love, just a cocked eyebrow or a ""Jesus christ this bitch is crazy."" People with BPD have a 1 in 10 rate of suicide, and I can see why. I am alone and everything hurts. I want to speed up the inevitable, I don't see a reason to mull around in this pain and this loneliness for a few more years before I bring even more heartbreak on myself and kill myself anyway"

"I tried and failed, but gunna try again.Hi all, I recently tried to kill myself by hanging.  I posted this earlier on r/AMA but i got a lot of negative feedback, hopefully the people here are a touch more compassionate.  By a complete fluke, my neighbour walked in about 30 seconds after id stepped off my stool to return a popcorn bowl.  Id been planning this for about a year, and i think im going to give it another go at the end of the month, and make sure my door's locked this time.  


I'm not irrational, i dont try and kill myself out of some emotional outburst, and its not a spur of the moment decision.  My life is actually quite good, I've got a good job as a concept artist, i own my own condo, I've got lots of good friends.

I was quite badly neglected as a child.  My therapist told me i have a form of low grade background depression; its just always there, like an itch you can't scratch.  It feels like being stuck at an airport with nowhere to go, just always in transit, never quite at home.    


Ive never had much luck in relationships.  Im quite handsome, im fun to be around.  Im compassionate and I invest in the people im close to, yet it seems the women i meet are more interested in using me to boost their self esteem and move on after 2 weeks.  I dont know how many times ive gotten something along the lines of ""youve given me the self confidance i need to move on and find what im really looking for.""

I've accepted that life can be brutal and unfair, that people can be unbelieveably selfish, and you have to be a boarderline sociopath to make it in this world.  Its just that, im not built that way, so there's really not a place for me here.  So i'm leaving.  


Thank you to anyone who's got some advice for dealing with something similar, however if I can't figure this out in the next month I'd really like to see what's waiting for me on the other side"

"I think im going to kill myself today I have been severly depressed more than a year, i have been taken to (i dont remember the translation) mental hospital so i dont kill myself already once and almost twice, i dont think my antidepressents are working.

"Today is the day. I think it's time to say goodbye.First, I'm not looking for attention. I'm not crying out for help. I've been wanting to do this every day for weeks. I've done my research and I have a plan. It's CO poisoning. Easy. 

My wife of 8 years, my best friend in the world, left me a few months ago. She left me because I took her for granted and I'm a piece of shit. I miss her so much but she has gotten past me. She doesn't even want to talk to me. I reached out to her a few weeks ago just to talk. Talk about being depressed, etc. She said she can't help me with my needs. I will not be able to live with her being with someone else. I recently lost my job, I'm about to  be homeless and I'm almost penniless. I have nothing. I am devoid of hope. My exit plant has been set up for a couple of weeks and today is the day. 

Some of you guys who are trying to help on here were sent by angels. I wish my heart was as pure and caring as yours. "

"I felt like something was wrong with me because my dad left us If you are growing up and your dad isn't part of your daily life, then you may be like I was.

I grew up in the 70s and 80s with four older siblings and our mom.

We saw our dad once or twice a year, since he lived out of state, and wasn't around for us.

I didn't realize it then, but as I got older I started to feel like something must have been wrong with me, if dad could bring himself to leave our family.

I was fortunate in that I had a couple of men in the neighborhood who took me under their wing.  I could go to them with ""dad questions"".  I even got chewed out by them once in a while, and believe it or not, that made me feel good, because I knew they cared about me.

Last year I started a YouTube channel for boys growing up without a dad in their daily lives.  (Girls are welcome too).

If you feel like there is something missing in your life because your dad isn't there, then you may want to check out the channel at [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodnY\_LHqZm9WPQ7pzLr\_aQ/](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodnY_LHqZm9WPQ7pzLr_aQ/).  My goal is just to help you feel how valuable you are, even if your dad isn't in your daily life.

If you have a dad question, ask it in the channel comments, or here, and I'll try to make a video for you about it."
"I failed. I cant do this.My best, my only friend finally did it. I wish I could've helped him so much more, so much sooner. I wish I'd have taken out time for him. I wish I could understand what he was going through. Now that he's gone, I don't deserve to live either. I killed him."
"i can just picture my mom walking in on me laying on the bathroom floorshe would realize that taking my phone and screaming at me isnât the right way to respond to someone who wants to end their life. my dad would be kinder to others. the problem would be gone. everyone is happy. everything goes back to normal, but better"
"Iâm ready.Iâve been ready for 11 years. Iâm tired. Iâve never been protected by those meant to do so. Iâve never been safe. Why canât my suicide be as easy as when they ignored my pain, called me a liar, beat me, raped me, abused me, left me on my own as a child to protect myself. Almost killed me and my brother because they were a fucking drug addict. Narrowly avoided someone discovered to be planning my murder. Being raped and contracting an incurable STI. Being chronically ill and denied disability permanently. Being infertile to have the family I dreamed of.

How much more do people have to see me endure before theyâll let me go? How much more will they stand by as voyeurs to and watch me have to fight alone like I always have, but wretch and moan when I feel like ending this cycle?

Then telling me they love me fixes nothing. Their love didnât fix stop any of this. Their love is actually panic that Iâll do what Iâve been wanting to do.

Theyâll cry as if they didnât hear my cries for years on end. Theyâll cry as if they didnât make jokes about me reaching out for help. Theyâll cry as if they helped me.

None of them did. Theyâre all liars."

"Having very dark thoughts and in a deep depression after a sudden breakup. I'm not usually a sad person like this, I feel emptier and emptier inside with every week that passes even though I'm supposed to feel better as time passes.Long story short. My relationship with my ex was this: her dad died 4 months into the relationship. Since his death I was the ideal boyfriend, always showed her love in every sense of the world, while supporting her with whatever little money I had and basically doing all the work for both of us in our shared uni classes so she could graduate on time. I was the perfect boyfriend in and she told me that often, I gave 110% to the relationship and took the little she gave me in return as I understood her depression and mental state wouldnât allow her to give me even 20% at times.

A month and a half ago her dogs died suddenly, adding more tragedy to our lives. 2 weeks later she breaks up with me suddenly and out of nowhere. Tells me she loves me, wants me in her life further down the road, but that she feels we are beginning to resent one another. Iâm confused as I had nothing but love for her, I beg her to stay with me as I sob like a newborn and suggest a break instead. Sheâs affirmative that she needs to break up with me and doesnât want to give me false hope with a break...and then she states she needs to âfocus on myself for the time beingâ. Then she makes a bunch of excuses and reasons for the breakup to justify it in her mind, such as âwe argued too much... we are too strong-minded and never saw eye to eye on anything and I donât think we ever willâ. Then she goes on to state âyou always gave it your all when I couldnât even give 10% of what you gave and I really tried even if you didnât think I didâ. I think she just wanted to be single for some time now and had no idea how to tell me/ also loved the support and comfort I brought her with all that I did for her.

My problem is that I did everything ârightâ, as I stated previously, I was the ideal bf, never cheated, lied, yelled at her, anything like that. Our arguments were always âhey I want to see you more... or hey Iâm tired of you always being so distant with me and only meâ. And yet I feel a deep emptiness inside of me from the breakup. I feel confused and every day that passes I feel myself not being able to feel better with her absence. Iâm alone, and I am unhappy without her. Itâs been over a month since the breakup and every week seems harder. I go to therapy, I talk to friends, I distract myself, I exercise. I do everything Iâm supposed to, and yet things arenât getting easier like they are supposed to. I just miss her, I love her and never stopped loving her. I wish the breakup never happened, yet it feels like it was a decision made on my behalf. And the fact that she stated she loves me still and wants me in her life as a friend later down the road, absolutely kills me inside. How am I supposed to be okay with her being with someone else later, when I never stopped loving her. I just need help, any suggestions at this point, any wisdom. I am lost and I donât know what else to do anymore without her. I always saw myself marrying her, having kids with her, now my life looks so empty without her in it.

TLDR: Gf and I had a tragic filled relationship with deaths occurring in her life. I was always very supportive, the perfect boyfriend. She broke up with me suddenly and blindsided me just a month ago. Claims she still loves me, called me her best friend, and wants me as that same best friend later down in life. My heart breaks just thinking about her moving on without me, yet I canât bear to have her leave my life. Made it very uncertain why she broke up with me since she said âwe never saw eye to eyeâ then said, âI couldnât put the same amount of effort as you did and that wasnât fair to youâ. So I was left confused and heartbroken. I still love her, Iâve been doing everything Iâm supposed to... therapy, friends, self-work, hobbies. All of it, and yet I still feel empty. I just need some advice, some words of wisdom as I feel my mind drift to darker and darker places as the weeks go on and the emptiness inside me grows."
"Hello reddit, this morning I got confirmation that a friend of 5 years committed suicide.I truly did not see it coming. I am in shock right now and it feels like my heart has shut down. 

She suffered from epilepsy for many years . The doctor gave her about 3-4 months left to live before the severity of it overtook her and a fatal injury occurred. Unfortunately she decided she couldn't wait for her possible death and ended her life. 

I don't know what to do. I feel numb, lost and broken. I'm not suicidal or depressed.. Just sad. This is my 3rd friend I've lost to suicide.. And this one has probably hit the hardest. 
I'm sick.. Sad and hurt. 

I'm lost reddit. Lost for words and feeling. I wish there was something I could've done to help her.. No one deserves to end their life in that way..

"Did I just save a life?I was taking a drive at night just now and I was on my way home. I saw a shadow of a person on the bridge. I get this feeling all over that I need to talk to this person. I turn around and called out to her. Well call her (B). I asked B if she was ok and if she wanted to talk. She told me she was just having a bad day and she was fine. I told her I had no where else to be. She again said she was fine and she thanked me. So... I left. I started driving and I couldnât shake the feeling that I should go and seriously talk to her. So I turned around and parked close by and walked towards the bridge. I didnât see her anywhere and I was starting to get nervous. When I saw her I started up a conversation. B told me about her being trapped in a relationship with her bf and we shared some of our life storyâs. We talked for a long time. When we started to leave the bridge she hugged me. I gave her the best hug I could.

"I've turned into such a loser, I have so much hate for myselfI've flunked out of uni, almost flunked out of community college (albeit doing well now), been fired from a fast food job for a drinking problem (I stopped drinking, eventually), lost all passion and motivation for what I used to love, and failed miserably at independent living.

I've scuttled around between living with my parents and both my sisters (I'm back with my parents now, I fucked up too many times with my sisters), but I still have no handle on myself. The one time I tried being an independent adult I managed to lose ALL of my friends - literally none of them talk to me anymore because I either pissed them off or I wasn't able to get back to them consistently enough to be worth their time.

I'm transgender (fucking cliche, right? How many of these do you guys get?) and my parents know, but I'm such a piece of work. Shit-ugly as a boy, nowhere near passable as a girl. Why the fuck should I even bother? I feel worse if I don't, though, which is *really* saying something. Regardless, I can't even take myself seriously, most days I just try to pretend I don't have a gender so I don't have to think about it. My life is too much of a mess to worry about this right now, anyway.

I was smart, funny, musical, fucking *talented*, and full of potential, back in high school - and the stuff I did showed it.  Where the fuck am I now? Im a horrible, horrible, horrible failure. I have no inspiration, unchecked emotions that I don't know what to do with (I just accidentally broke my parents' laptop screen and cried/hyperventilated for twenty minutes about it), and such a difficult climb back up. Even if I can make it, I still have all this shit in my head that gets triggered easily. I remember the bad stuff too well, one trigger leads to a very fast, downward spiral.

I don't like anything about who i've become. Nothing. I don't like the superficial things, the mental things, the emotional things, behavioral, etc. I can't fucking *do anything* anymore. I'm 21 but I feel like my life is over already. Why try? Why even fucking try?

Sorry this is so poorly written, I haven't felt this bad in weeks, my head's not on straight. I also haven't been open with anyone in close to a year so everything's spilling out."

"Never ending guilt cycle.Iâm at the end of a crisis situation. SO got drunk, which made them get really sad and wanted me to kill them. Begging me, telling me they were losing their mind. I tried to just let them get it all out and got them to bed. Used a crisis line to stay level headed and removed firearms from the house. I was suicidal in the past,so it was a bit more difficult going through all this. But my suicide attempts are kinda the reason for all this. They feel guilty because they are stuck thinking they caused my suicide attempts. Theyâre stuck in one moment in time unable to let go. They tried therapy, we had several family sessions talking about what happened, and weâre in a place right now that they canât get the same kinda help I got. Weâd kinda lose everything if they went away for any serious form of treatment. Their sadness honestly happens every time they drink (which is like once a month) and I try my best to keep them from going overboard but always fail and get left in positions like Iâm currently in. Theyâre partially right, their actions did trigger a mental break, but it only brought childhood trauma, anxiety and depression to the surface. But I dealt with all that when I was in treatment, moved on. So they feels guilty for the past they canât let go of, Iâve forgiven them and moved on, but every time they break down after drinking, I feel guilty for making them go through me being suicidal and causing their pain. I suggest getting help, talking to other people if they canât talk to me about it, but theyâre stuck not wanting help and holding onto pain that has pushed them to the âI canât do it anymoreâ point. Everyone is safe for now, but I have no idea whatâll happen in the light of day. "

"School Sucks- here's a rant why School is honestly the worst part of my life and it completely doesn't make sense. First, I'll talk about nonsensical school stereotypes and then we'll move on to the meaty stuff.

Firstly, homework. I struggle to understand the logic behind homework. The argument that was always made to me was ""so the student doesn't forget"". Aw, shit, I wasn't in school for ten goddamn hours and I forgot! Why send students home when you DEMAND MORE OF THEIR TIME? Just extend the classes to five! But that'd make everyone angry because the school eats up too much time... so fuck it.

Secondly, studying. I'm surprised nobody brings up how silly studying is because it's basically cheating. If the point of a test is to see what you've learned, then studying is literally cramming information in case you didn't learn in a metric for what you did learn. Confusing, huh?

And this leads into the third oddity- grades. The original goal of educating children has become abandoned, and in its stead, school has become a wholehearted attempt to teach children that success is measured by how high one can climb on the charts. It's not a really good lesson.

There's also the hypocrisy- you hear constant, constant, constant lessons about mental health. In my school, it was and is hammered home that if you have any sort of problem, talk to your guidance counselors or the school counselors. Problem is... I didn't know the name of my guidance counselor until my dad emailed the school because I was FAILING in a class and didn't even know that I could drop it. I was never told how to find this person, never told their name, with the only clue being a vague ""resources are online"" because *what fucking isn't*. 

Other things I hear way too much: ""manage your stress!"" THEN STOP HEAPING FUCKING HOMEWORK ON ME, PEOPLE! It honestly makes me sad that the school seems to think that simply standing a student at point A and telling them they want to be at point B with no information. How about you tell me how to manage stress? How about you help? God forbid you get out from behind your desk and off of your leather seat to help the students, they can figure it out by themselves. Man, the schools are tone deaf in every way!

And then we take all of this, we mix it all in a pot, and toss it on a bunch of developing minds fresh out of middle school and expect them to adapt.

And guys, I'm from Mahomet fucking Illinois. In the top 1,000 schools out of 130,000.

I think school could be better- this may be radical, but get rid of homework and make grades less important. Take some of the importance out of tests and make them more about being checkpoints. And for god's sake, stop making it about being the best school ever and teach the fucking kids. Actually help them.

School just doesn't work as it is."

"Nowhere else to go, so I'm here againtl;dr: same stuff I've posted about for 2 months. Been abused heavily for 10+ years, the person I trusted the absolute most cheated on me and said things to me that I'll carry with me until I die (not in a good way). Days keep getting worse and worse and I don't feel like I have a way out aside of suicide

Not gonna lie, I've been trying to do the whole self-valuing thing lately. My therapist has been (understandably) concerned with how I pretty much see myself as subhuman and only worth dying, so I've been trying things she's told me to help with it. But my self esteem and value in myself are just non-existent at this point. 

I've been emotionally abused for most of my life and pretty much taught that I'm worthless. Had it screamed at me for years and I literally could do nothing about it (still can't honestly). Then when I thought I was safe with someone and I felt like I had value to someone, that was all thrown away (Girlfriend of 2 years knew about how deep my anxiety and depression is and how abandonment and cheating are 2 of my worst fears, so she went ahead and cheated on me with not only her best female friend, but her best male friend as well. While I was quite literally at the lowest point I'd ever been, and she had known about this and ignored all my pleas for help and caring).

I feel like a a corpse in waiting, and that's pretty much it. I feel like I'm a heap of worthless shit. People told me 3 months ago that in 3 months time, I'd be a lot better off. I am worse off mentally than ever before. 

I mentioned this before (I think), but I can't even look people in the eyes anymore when I talk to them. I cannot get myself to do it. Seriously physically impossible for me now. Does anyone know what this is? Like what that's a sign of? 

I just want to be dead honestly. I want it more than I want happiness. I really, really am trying to get better, but there's no way up. I'm emotionally and sexually lonely and I feel like I deserve that and that I deserve all the abuse and cheating. I'm not asking for someone to be like ""oh no you don't deserve that"", I'm just saying that it's how I feel inside and changing how I feel is ridiculously difficult/impossible. 

There's no way up, regardless of all the things I've tried to get to a better place. As you can tell from my post history, I've been posting here a fair bit over the past few months to no real avail. I'm sorry that I'm hopeless

I know this probably wasnât the most appropriate sub to post this on but I just know thereâs a lot of good people on this sub and I just really need the help

I always feel like Iâm not creative, funny, or witty. Yeah sure my friends have told me Iâm really funny and pretty creative but ever since Iâve started having anxiety and depression itâs felt like hell for my brain. Iâm honestly scared to death I wonât be able to just be myself and be the person I want to be, I just canât put my mind to it and it really bothers me Iâm really insecure about this stuff.

Then thereâs something with my speech, sometimes I can speak clearly but then most of the time I fumble my words and it just sounds weird. I swear Iâve never had a speech impediment, I donât get it, this is one of the number one things that ruins my jokes and my confidence into trying to add something to the conversation. It just puts me in an awful mindset and discourages me and even makes me sad. Iâve never had this issue itâs like just now I guess I donât know to be honest. 

I know depression has messed with my brain a lot, I havenât laughed a lot until just recently itâs been 2 weeks I guess maybe a month since I started laughing again and laughing a lot usually in my Group FaceTimeâs, I just donât know what to do about it I wanna always feel happy and funny, I just wanna keep feeling the satisfaction of making peopleâs days with my jokes. 

Tonight I went outside for a walk of course it was dark and I was listening to 432 hertz music and while I was walking I constantly felt like I was being watched and followed. I swear I kept seeing figures, I was scared and my anxiety kicked in and now I have this weird head ache. 

I donât wanna feel like this anymore I want to learn how to be witty again, I want to learn how be happy and crack jokes, I want to be more confident in myself but my stupid brain just doesnât want to work, thereâs something wrong with my brain I canât think quickly and I just want to think quick of a joke or just doing stuff in general. I just want to be funny again I want to be myself and the person I picture me as the person I always want to be. I donât know how and I want to fix myself, how can I improve myself Iâm so sick and tired of this feeling, please any advice helps."

"Older man lured me into his van and led me onI was using a website and was bored during quarantine.

Guy pops up.

We talk for 3 hours.

He says let's meet at blank.

I'm like sure.

Okay, tells me about his life.

Wants me to have his kid.

I tell him I am a virgin.

He holds my hand.

He tells me to kiss him.

Then tongue in mouth shit.

Clothes off and coerced into a blowjob.

Drove around for 3 hours.

I was thinking erratically. I looked him up after, searched.

He has a wife, profile taken down.

She's older.

He kept my mask in his fucking van.

He humiliates me that I should brush my hair. He smells like shit.

Tells me he is not 'interested' in me but he was aka he's looking for people closer.

I really want to kill myself.

If god is real he kills himself first.

Context: Before this I quit my therapist

The doctor calls afterwards (because I'm sure he stalks my FB) and knows something's up and schedules a private meeting with me via phone.

I'm ready to kill myself."
"Read this for a second.No, it's not a cry for help, I just want to lay out the truth.

I can say many things to you that you would like to hear but, the truth is that people are stop believing in themselves. They judge themselves by thinking how are they going to look to people, but that doesn't matter. The only thing someone else can do about your life is talk. They say that their life's a disaster, well there is know way of calculating that and if someone tells you that you ain't going to anything just smile at them and they will burn inside with their own anger.

I see positivity rarely. People look out for compliments and if they don't get them, they get sad and depressed. But I'll tell you what the biggest compliment is it is to have a positive mind. You'll notice that you feel happy even when you appreciate someone's work and get a thank-you in return.

Instead of focusing on what made you happy or what made you sad, just focus on what you're about to do to be happy and let those people around you talk about you again."

"I'm just really not feeling lifeFirst off, if someone is snooping through my Reddit, fuck you.

It's not that I want to be the cause of my own death, but I really don't want to live either. School is just miserable for me, yeah it's easy. I've always been told that I was smart, but despite I'm failing nearly everything. My test scores are always 90+, but homework and assignments that are meant to be completed out of class make me actually suicidal, and it's terrible. My incompetence in school has lead to my parents berating me and just compounding upon my misery. I see a therapist, and she does help me, but she doesn't know the extent of my problems and I don't know how to tell her about anything at all. I feel like nobody really cares about me, even if they exhibit signs of caring they're just acting or trying to be nice. Who would care about me anyway? I'm just one of seven billion worthless souls with the exception being I have no point, no purpose, no reason to exist. Nobody loves me, and if anyone does they're really terrible at exhibiting it. My parents think they can help, but in reality if I didn't have to go to school or live with them I believe I'd be able to sort out all my problems on my own. My parents try to talk to me about school and my mother accuses me of not trying, my father tells me that i'm making up my misery and proceeds to make jokes about how i'm smart but do terribly in school. I told my mother what I actually felt for once today, that I wanted to die. She freaked out and just made me feel even worse. She guilts me into and out of everything I've ever done and it makes me so unhappy. School just gets even worse every year, despite me getting ~1-2 questions wrong on each of my tests throughout the year and scoring very near to perfectly on every big important test teachers continue to recommend me for lower-level classes next year. My intelligence is the one thing I appreciate about myself, and even that is dwindling. I show the ability to do the work, and it isn't failure to comply when I don't do homework. I don't do it because deep down I really want to live but I don't know how when everything around me makes me want to die, and even though the teachers have seen me perform, they know i'm capable, they tell me i'm not smart enough to be in the highest level classes, even when my scores are almost entirely the highest. Everything I'm supposed to be living for makes me want to die more and more. I feel like I die every day. Typically when people are happy, they act happy. When they're sad they act sad. When they're hungry they eat. I've felt dead for years, maybe I should start playing.


There's more I want to write, but fuck it, who cares anyway. What you all do here is wonderful, but If I don't believe for a second any of you really care for any of these individuals, even if you try to make it seem that way."
"I dont wanna do this anymoreI dont expect much input on this bc why would i.

"Panic disorder, loneliness, feeling of emptiness, and I think I'm becoming suicidalI don't know what to say. I'm not happy, and I have several things that are becoming extremely unbearable to me.

Thinking about it I have never ever been truly happy. I've had good moments, but there has been always something causing me to be miserable in the long term.

My mom is schizophrenic, we moved to a different country when I was young and also had serious economical / abuse issues coming from the guy she got together with (he would constantly abandon us without any money for food or anything, we moved there because they were supposed to marry and that ever happened. He also beat my mom in several occasions). My mom had to work in a table dance several times when they broke up, and we didn't have papers to live legally there because we were technically economical dependants of him but he didn't want to sign the paperwork for that. My mom has the best intentions with me but unfortunately she has always had mental problems, which as time passed worsened and made my childhood really harsh.

I specifically remember one instance where they fought, I was around 10 years old and my mom made me call him to tell him she cut her wrists, and she was holding a knife to her wrists to make me cry while on the call.
 
High school was sort of a better time, I became very independent from my mom, selling imported candies at school to make money for myself, made some amazing friends... And then I tried weed, which caused me my first panic attack, which developed into a panic disorder. 
 
I had a boyfriend  when I was 16 for 1 1/2 years (I'm gay), who I loved very much, and he did too, but he was a very heavy cheater, and the relationship got toxic in the sense that we were always fighting, making up, fighting again, we broke up like once a week and had extreme arguments where we screamed at each other on the streets or wherever we were.

Then when I was 19, my mom had finally broken up for real with the guy, and we had no options, she talked to our consulate and they helped us getting a flight back to our home country. I had 3 days notice for this.

Coming back was 1) a massive cultural shock, from a chaotic/underdeveloped country but with warm/friendly people to eastern Europe where everyone in general seems to hate life. I also didn't knew anyone.

I didn't got to go to university. I had to work in a call center doing regular nightshifts with a crazy schedule. Got a second episode of panic disorder. Got depressed.

I've had 3 relationships since returning. The 1st one when I just came back, that lasted 8 months where I was very neglectful (I don't even remember much of the relationship). I started to become much more antisocial, and I'm sort of weird now, it's difficult to maintain conversations with people. I had 2 other relationships afterwards, (6 and 4 months), and in both of them ended because they couldn't fall in love with me.

Now I have a very good job, I became a self taught software developer and I'm making 4x as much as I did 2 years ago, I am in the 5% top income for my country, but I am paying off debts I had from before which I irresponsibly took out. 

I have some friends here, but I don't really feel attached to them, even though some of them are attached to me. I try really hard to find a relationship (almost pathologically), and typically my mood is apathetic, it rises really high when I meet someone who I like and seems like they like me back, and then it gets crushingly low when it doesn't work out, and usually it doesn't, because I've become clingy, and have serious trust issues where whenever I'm not with a person in dating im sure they don't care about me / are with other guys, etc... I'm not bad looking and get many dates if I want to, but it's mostly just sex and I don't really yearn that, but I do it in the hopes of finding more :( 
 
I started getting panic attacks again, though now I haven't had one for a couple weeks. 
 
I'm just lost, and I find myself fantasizing about suicide often. Not yet in a serious way, more like in a romanticised way, but it's becoming more common and in afraid it will become real...

Sorry for the rant, im just feeling like everything is too much.

There's some hope too tough. My best friend has been there for 6 years in some capacity or another, but she is 11000KM away. In 2 months I'll finally be able to visit her, as my finances improve. But I'm also afraid of maybe not feeling the same after meeting her again? I don't know. I think it's my fault that I don't click with people, I don't know what's wrong with me, since i moved back here I can't connect with people and feel crushingly lonely even with company. I only really feel ""happy"" when I'm dating someone and that is kind of pathetic.

I've been to a psychologist, I had 3 sessions and I felt mildly better talking about things but it seems like a lot of bullshit to me.

I don't know what to do."

"Justifiable SufferingHow long does on have to suffer before society says it is acceptable to die?

I've done my part by reaching out and trying to get better only to be shat upon each and every time. 

I will not be opening up to people again. Vulnerability is only exploited against me. It is a weakness.

People do not want to help. They just don't want to be exposed to the negativity of someone's suicide. They think only of themselves, especially in our unhealthy hyperindividualistic society of today.

So, how long will you let others suffer so that you do not have to feel bad?"
"I just feel trapped.Iâve got nothing going for me. No goals, no aspirations, no interests other than playing video games like a degenerate. Even thatâs not the same anymore. 

All my friends are going to college and doing something with their lives and Iâm stuck sitting here. I donât know what I want to do. Even if I did I canât afford it. 

I think about ending it all the time but I just canât.  My mom and sisters would be devastated. My friends would be devastated as well. And I canât in good conscience put the people I care about through that sort of pain. So here I am. Trapped. 

Even if, god forbid, I outlive them all, I still donât think I would be able to end it. The fear of failing and being stuck in a vegetative state is enough for me to continue on. 

I canât see a therapist because thereâs no way in hell Iâd trust one. Thanks high school English class for making us read âOne Flew Over the Cuckoos Nestâ and making me develop a crippling fear of involuntary hospitalization! I also canât afford a therapist so thereâs that too lmao. 

So Iâm trapped here waiting for the inevitable, hoping that some space debris will come and fly through my head and kill me instantly. Thatâd be the day. 

I donât know if this is the right sub to post this on because Iâm not on the verge of suicide, Iâm just ranting. Maybe r/depression but I donât know. I surprisingly feel a bit better after writing this so I may start a journal or something to keep my mind occupied at least for a few minutes."
"Should I wait or just go through with it now?Im a 35 year old male and I really really want to kill myself, I have too many reasons which I won't get into here but I'm just not happy in this world, I never was and I don't want to be here anymore. The problem is my parents. I don't want to put them through it. I had always planned on waiting until they were no longer with us and then I could kill myself guilt free. But it's getting really hard. If I do it now it would hurt them but maybe they will get over it? I feel trapped because I have to put up this pretend mask that everything is OK and I'm normal even though they know I've never had a girlfriend my entire life. But recently it's been getting harder and harder to keep it up. Should I just end it now or just suffer on in silence for another 20 years?"
"It's about timeI hate my patologic family, I hate how everything that happens in my life is a bad thing. I have enough of everyone treating me like shit and telling me how worthless I am but they're right.

I feel like I'm driving on a highway where the further I drive the worse the weather gets, and all of the exits goes to the same place, I better just pull of sooner than later. I got this all figured out, I'll just inhale a shitload of nitrogen gas and pass out peacefully. I even told about my plan to one of my friends and you know what he said? He said that I'm fucking nuts and i should go to mental ward. I just need few days, few fucking days more to write letters to few people about how i fucking hate them and few to people who i actually like and say how much they've helped me through all of this and how's it not their fault. It's about time to end this, once and for all...."
"I can't take it anymore. I am so done with life.Throwaway for obvious reasons. I have written like 4 texts in English in my life, so I apologize for my grammar. 

**Background**

My parents got divorced when I was 1 or 2 yrs old. I was a ""happy"" mistake, so I grew up with my grandma. As an only child living without his parents, people pitied me and this made the whole experience worse for me. I have been drawing crosses with  captions ""I wanna die"" when I was 4 years old. Most kids at this age were eating their boogers and driving parents nuts, but at point I missed my own parents so much that I couldn't imagine living like that any longer. My mother hated my father, who had alcohol problems, and she has tried to brainwash me to dislike him. I have been visiting my dad every week for years and after some time I didn't see an alcoholic anymore but a smart guy who made a terrible mistake and has had an extremely difficult childhood. Every time when I think about my father, I can't hold back my tears. Such an awesome and intelligent person having bad luck. Born as bastard, hated by his whole family, getting a deadly disease while blood transfusion, alcoholism, his only child hates him, clinical depression and much more. 

I have always been quiet and introverted type of person. I have never had any friends except one dude, who is still my BFF. I attempted suicide at 14 by cutting my wrists. Many adults told me, that I am exceptionally mature for my age and while having very good grades and high IQ, I relied on my given intelligence to pass through classes. How smart kids with no work ethic end up, everyone knows. Of course I've noticed an interesting phenomenon. If my behavior was based on my inner feel, no one wanted to have any interaction with my. But as soon as I started faking it, more kids started to respect me and some even thought I was 'that' funny guy. At that time I started improving myself. Change my wardrobe, work out, read books, learn new skills etc. 

**Current situation**

The day I became an adult I moved out to another country for better opportunities. After a year I received a position in my dreamed profession. I got friends and people wanted to spend their free time with me. I have even had a cute FWB for like 3 years. I got money to buy almost anything I could dream of. Good grades at school, life is great.

And I my depression has never been so bad. 

I sought out for help by shrinks, used drugs, meditation, more exercise, talked to my mum. Nothing. Even the smallest inconvenience drove me to drug abuse, panic attacks, chest pain, sweating and crying. I can't take the absurdity of life, everything is so empty. I don't get it, theoretically speaking my life is awesome, but I can't take it anymore. I hate talking with people, yet I hate being alone. In my job I have to carry quite a lot of responsibility and as an apprentice I have to work with live system, sometimes under a huge pressure. If I'm taking huge responsibility for my actions which are being performed under a time pressure, my brain shuts of. I can't think at all, I'm in panic and make really stupid mistakes. I don't fit into this modern life, I hate it. It's so pointless. We all are gonna die anyway, and I don't have any FOMO by dying at 22. I can't imagine the pain my parents are going to receive with my sudden death, but I can't take it anymore longer.

I have over 18 cubic feet of compressed UN 1046 Helium in my room, ready to go. In next couple days I will cancel all of my subscriptions, bonds etc, sent letters to family, work, landlord etc., clean my room, pay any due bills for next month and then exit this world. "
"i dont know what to do anymorehey. im in a really bad place right now. theres some family issues, some friend issues, some health issues, some brain issues... i think about killing myself almost every day.. iâve been clean from self harm for years but the past few months i just sometimes miss that feeling so much, so i do things to chase that high again. and im only 17. im about to go to college and room with someone who broke my heart, but im too afraid to ask for help.

i think i just need someone to tell me that theres a way out of this, cuz i keep looking around and im just not seeing one. im so afraid that in 5 years i will be the same person i am right now, with the same people and the same job and the same degree. i dont think anything scares me more.

im probably just being dramatic. i have therapy on wednesday. until then, i just have to keep trying, right?"

"Feel like my life's over before it even startedI'll start off by explaining the title: I'm pretty young (under 18; I don't feel comfortable with giving out my real age in case somebody recognizes this) and I feel like my life is completely fucked before I've even had the chance to really experience it.

I'm homeschooled and I really hate it. I'm not smart like a lot of you guys and I have difficulty understanding the material, not to mention the fact that I can't concentrate for shit. I've got exams soon and I'm almost positive that I'm going to fail most of them.

I've tried speaking to my mom (dad ran off somewhere, haha) about it but whenever somebody tries to have a serious discussion with her, she tries to make it a game, or just simply puts it off. She's a really wonderful person but her attitude towards anything remotely negative that needs to be sorted out is infuriating. I love her but I'm finding it difficult not to resent her at the moment.

I don't really have any friends either. I've got a few people I know online and they're really nice, but online friendships aren't the same. I have a real life friend but his dad's job requires him to move a lot, so I only see him once or twice a year.

I'm sorry if this sounds stupid. Maybe I'm just a whiny bitch, which would be fucking typical of me. I know there're people much worse off but I just feel like such absolute crap at the moment."

"Forced equality is not equality nor is it equity There are many people out there that are still convinced that the existence of juries or work forces that are composed of all whites are racist or bad. Others say that minorities need to be in certain groups for equal representation even if they are less qualified than someone in the majority.

First of all, lets talk about the former statement. Imagine you have a large bag. You put 73 white marbles in the bag. Then you put 16 black marbles in the bag. After that, you put an assortment of different marbles for the final 11 (these represent other groups). This gives you 100 marbles in the bag.

Mix up the bag and then take 10 marbles out without looking. This may be a workforce for a small business, or a group of friends, or whatever. Look at the colours of the marbles. Record it, and put it back in the bag. You will find that if you repeat this experiment hundreds or even thousands of times, there will be instances where you pull 10 white marbles. *This is not racism, this is literally true randomness. if there is a majority of one group of people in a nation, chances are that there are smaller groups of people only comprised of that particular race.* you could pull 10 black marbles, but that is incredibly unlikely because math.

If you make it so there can be no all-white groups, you actually make it LESS random. The only way to do that is to look at the **colours that you are choosing**. Do you see the problem here? You *have* to be racist to force equality

Now, lets look at the later statement. If you have a country run via an oligarchy who's rulers are comprised of a blind person, a deaf person, a person of colour, a gay person, and a Muslim, are they going to make better decisions than a group of people who are more qualified/smarter that also happen to look similar to each other or have similar preferences of sex or religion? No. The smarter group of people are going to make better decisions in regards to making that nation better.

Of course, if the first group was just as qualified as the second then there would be no problem here. Both groups of people would be good at running this imaginary nation in that case.

Forced equality is not comparable to equality because equality means giving everyone the same amount of resources that they can use to succeed. Forced equality is just giving minorities an extra die for no reason. It cant be compared to equity either. Equity is giving people different amounts of resources in such a way that everyone has an equal chance of success. Equity outputs random results. Forced equality does not."
"Anime and Kpop fans yet Anti-Asian? I see a huge trend of Gen Zs being huge fans of Kpop and Anime, jumping on the trend, yet seem to be blatantly racist to Asians or ignore their issues? I see this all the time on TikTok and Online, in a way, Asian culture has become a key part of Gen Zs identity, with TikTok (a Chinese app), Japanese dances and trends, Anime, Kpop, manga etc. Yet with the recent events that are going on, most of my friends seem to be indifferent or not care at all about the racism that is happening despite being fans of Anime and stuff."

Iâm not good enough for anything and just expressing my feelings this way makes me feel embarrassed guilty and selfish. Because I know I make people happy I make my good friends and I can make strangers happy but Iâm not anything. Iâm worthless. My family blames me for everything and I canât support myself enough to break away from them nor would I want to since Iâve never been out of a shell. Iâm not a person Iâve been kept inside and I feel like a robot where I had just developed traits and added it to the list inside me and pull them out when Iâm with people. only certain people would probably know Iâm hurting inside. I donât know if itâs worth living as though Iâm a burden anymore. I donât want to be selfish and kill myself within the next few days but I donât think Iâm going to live by next year. Iâve already isolated from my friends and I donât plan to speak to many people so I could be forgotten and it wonât hurt as much. 
"Just gonna rambleI never felt suicidal until the summer of 2015. After I was sexually assaulted I was convinced I had HIV (I had mono three weeks later which mimics the symptoms of seroconversion exactly). I hated myself for putting myself in a position that could wreck my life. I quit seeing my family and going to train martial arts because I was scared I would accidentally infect someone (you're most infectious the first 6 weeks).

After looking up the cost and terrible side affects of the HIV meds, I realized I could never burden someone with a relationship if I was positive. So I broke it off with the guy I was falling for and decided if I was positive suicude was the only option. This horrified me because I loved being alive and my self hatred reached new levels, since I blamed myself for what happened. 

I cried all day every day for weeks alone. I tried going to a few clinics for help but they were only interested in helping homosexuals psychologically. I was too afraid and ashamed to report the assault for many reasons so I didn't get help.

After I finally tested definitely negative I thought I would feel relieved and grateful. But nothing got better. Ive been alone and unable to function since. A lot of really horrible things also happened to me in mental hospitals and stuff. I lost my dog and the abusive guy I dated stole over 10k from me.

At some point I fixated on suicide again. The constant fear of death was gone and the PTSD lifted. I stopped having panic attacks and nightmares. But if I start feeling a desire to live again, I am overwhelmed with grief, terror and grief at everything I have lost and how evil some people are. I feel like if I ever found a smidgen of happiness it will be taken from me or used against me. The person I was a year ago gone. I'm not a person anymore. I've been dead for a very long time already."

"Chaotically numb

A bond to be broken, one carried with love. 
Creating chaos, with strings and a tug. 
Infused and misused, what a violent little thug. 
Burying your own face in dirty puddles of mud. 
Suffocated screams, when youâre surrounded by bugs. 
They say you wonât hear, if you stay quiet too long. 
So you cover your ears, you donât hear a sound. 
There you go building bridges, knowing theyâll fall to the ground. 
A mind so fragile, such a tiring flood. 
Your wounds wonât heal, if theyâre still covered in blood."

"I don't mean to be a bother, I just need some help...Like I said, I don't want to bother anyone, but I've been feeling increasingly suicidal for a while now. I think of death and smile, I hope I get into car accidents, die I'm my sleep, etc... But I never have the conviction to do it. Occasionally, I make plans to slowly starve myself. Previously, I self-harmed, but that had given way to suicidal plans/thoughts. My boyfriend describes me as a hardcore perfectionist with extremely low esteem, if that helps any.

Please, like I said, I dont want to bother, but I feel so hopeless, I just need some reassurance/help, I'm running out of options and reasons to stay alive. "

"I have a friend who I care about more than anyone who I think has been hinting that she wants to commit suicide. I plan on writing a letter this weekend for her to try to help her. I'm looking for advice as to what I should say to her.I don't have time to write a proper paragraph so I'm just going to do bullet points. This might be lengthy, so I'd appreciate anyone who reads it all and can give me any advice :)

I realize this sub if mostly for support, not advice, so if this belongs in a different sub, let me know. Also, is it a bad idea to cross post this to other relevant subs?

**Background info for context** (if you'd like to know anything else, just ask)**:**

* I'm a 12th-grade male in high school, she's 10th-grade
* Met her a little over a year ago
* The first few months of our friendship were the best months of my life and she was my best friend at the time. After those first few months that unfortunately went away and things have been rocky and dramay ever since. I'm not going to explain all of it because it's a lot.
* It's always been kind of an unbalanced friendship, I've always appreciated her and cared about her much more than she does to me (which I don't blame her at all, no one really likes me). I have always loved her (as a friend) more than anyone, even at the times she's hurt me, hated me, refused to talk to me, etc., I've always loved and cared about her through all of it.
* Yes, I only love her as a friend, I have never had feelings for her beyond that at all, ever. However, she doesn't believe me, she thinks I do like, but I've told her probably hundreds of times that I don't and she doesn't believe me no matter what I say. Usually when I talk about this to other people in real life they don't believe me either and it really frustrates me because I'm telling the truth, but hopefully you people will believe me since I have no reason to lie on here since it's kind of anonymous. And I'm 99.9% sure she's never liked me.
* I remember her mentioning a while ago the she attempted suicide before, but I don't think she told me any details besides that.
* She's mentioned that she used to cut herself and has scars, she said that she stopped though (she said this about a year ago). She could have been lying that she stopped just to stop me from worrying but I have no way of knowing, she also might have told the truth but maybe started again.
* Her life at home seems pretty toxic. She says her family members call her a slut among other horrible things, like her mom calls her a pun of her name replacing part of it with ""hell"", basically calling her the worst child or child from hell (hard to explain because I don't want to give away her name). She has told me that her mom has gotten her drunk before and has drugged her food before as punishment. And she's also told me that her old sister hits her, which I don't know how bad that is because everyone's siblings do that I think, but idk.
* She has been through a lot of terrible and traumatic things in her life already that no one should have to go through, especially so early in her life. I won't list everything here because even though I don't plan on her seeing this post or anyone is my real life to see it, I'm still a little worried that someone will find it, so I don't want to talk about those personal things about her here out of respect for her. Since it's relevant though, I will say that several people that are close to her have killed themselves, which has of course affected her. One kid in our school last year committed suicide who she knew (I didn't know him unfortunately, but I am still hurt that he killed himself). She also had a boyfriend who killed himself years ago, I believe that one affected her the most.
* Her and I are on ""okay"" terms right now. She never really talks to me anymore, kind of avoids me, but it's been worse, and I can still write her letters. I kind of avoid her too, even though I'd like to talk to her or at least say hi to her every few days, but I don't think she wants me too, so I don't.
* The last time I had a conversation was about three months ago where she finally talked to me after basically blocking me from talking to her for like 5 months. And she apologized to me for ""everything"" and I apologized to her as well (sincerely of course). She basically said that she just wanted to stop our ""feud"" (that's what she called it, but it was a one-sided feud, meaning she was mad at me, but I wasn't mad at her, so I wouldn't call it a feud), but she still didn't want to be my friend. And that really disappoints me because I care about more than anyone, but I respect that she doesn't want to be my friend because I know I'd just be a burden to her, and I wouldn't want to be friends with me either, so I don't blame her.
* Also during that conversation, she seemed to hint at being suicidal. One thing she said was that she ""wouldn't be here"" if it weren't for me, and that sounded to me like she was saying she would be dead if it weren't for me, but later she said that she just meant that I helped her grow basically.
* Another thing she said was that she ""starting over"", which I'm worried might be a hint at suicide because I can't really think of what else she could mean by that. I thought maybe she meant she was going to get totally new friends or something but as far as I can tell I think she still has the same friends, and she changes friends and relationships constantly ever since I met her, so even if she was changing friends it wouldn't be anything new for her. 
* She also said several other things that worried me but I don't remember them all exactly and also it's late for me and I'm trying to finish this post because I'm really tired so I don't want to list them all.
* She seems to think very negatively about herself and thinks she's a horrible person, and I remember her saying one time that all she does is hurt everybody.

So it's been about three months since that conversation and since then I've been trying to write a letter to her to try to help as much as I can (the reason I write letters instead of just talking to her in person is because I'm extremely awkward and I barely talk at all in person, so I express my thoughts to her by giving her letters.) I've been procrastinating on writing it and stuff, but I think about it everyday, and I worry that I'm taking to long and what if she's kills herself before I write it, and I've been worrying about it every day for the past 3 months. I want to finally write the letter and get it done by monday, so that's why I'm here asking advice.

**Things I could use advice on:**

* I actually plan on killing myself in a few years and I feel horrible about it because I feel like anything I say to convince her not to kill herself is hypocritical because I plan on killing myself. I have told her before about me being suicidal and she's reacted with anger towards me (which makes me feel horrible). I don't plan on talking about my own problems to her anymore, but should I? Also, should I feel like a hypocrite for trying to convince her not to kill herself?
* Also just want to mention that this post isn't about me, it's about her, and that's all I'm worried about at this time, so please focus on her, not me. After I get this letter done for her I will probably start focusing on myself for a while because I am the most depressed I've been in my life right now. But like I said, I just want to focus on helping her for now.
* What are some things I should/shouldn't say to her? (I will do some googling on this one, since I know it's probably a common question)
* I plan on being 100% honest with her, only saying things I actually mean genuinely. She doesn't really trust me though, how do I convince her I mean everything?
* I have more questions, but I need to sleep now so tomorrow I will edit this post and add more.

If you've read this far, thank you so much and I would appreciate any comments!

"So much guilt.I never knew it was possible to feel this much. I've destroyed my life and my family's. the guilt. No one has ever felt as much as I do now. If I could kill someone in exchange for this to be over, I'd do it in a heartbeat. Hell, I'd kill a 4 year in front of her mother just for this to end."

My English teacher, a 60 something year old Korean man, got into a discussion with my class about anime. This isn't just a ""Hahahaha, anime's so weird!"" discussion. This guy knows his s h i t . We talked about Haikyuu, Food Wars, Hunter x Hunter, JoJo, and even fucking Hentai. I even recommended Gurren Lagann to him! Holy fucking hell!"
"Anxiety is pushing me off the edgeI am sick of my life. I cannot enjoy a single minute without my brain reminding me that I am a fucking loser and everything I do is failure.

I made a big post on r/depression and to sum it up. I hate myself, i have nothing going for me, almost 29 and i live in a shitty basement with no relationship since i was 14, and no driving license. 

Never travelled, never had a year that felt good. Defeat after defeat. 'It gets better', and yet i am failing school, potential jobs and friends and family. 

I have nightmares every night about my upcoming exams after i failed hard last year and was told i was horrible at my field.

Every single day i fear upcoming stuff. I feared the first 6 weeks fo this years for months because i was going to do a lot of courses etc. And it went fine. Then i felt anxiety about something else. And now it's my exams. In 8 days, I have my first exam, and my brain already decided i will fail it. And the big exam at the end of the month. Yup will probably fail that too.

I dont want to live in fear. I wont ever get a drivers license because i fear that i am not capable of doing it right. I will never get to have a girlfriend because i know there are WAAAY better men out there. Both in terms of what they do, how nice they are and how they look. 

I cannot swim. So i think when it gets dark in 10 hours, I'll just jump in and drown in panic. Hopefully never to be found. 

I am sorry to everyone who are hurt. But I am no good at life, and life was not meant for everyone."
Nobody gets me.People need to understand that I don't cry because they call me names and make fun of me. I cry because I know it's always true.

"I'm not threatening my boyfriend but without him I'm going to kill myselfI've been suicidal and self harming since I was 9 and had my first suicide attempt since I was 10. I kept going though. Because I had a feeling that one day I would meet someone who would make everything better.

My boyfriend is that someone. He made me happy and it was like I had never had a problem in the past before. I stopped cutting and stopped being suicidal. But during Covid where were barley talking online because he's always busy helping out his family. And I can't help but think he wont love me after this. Maybe during Covid he's going to realise he doesn't need me and leave me.

Before I was with him I was going to kill myself. From a bad breakup with the guy I thought was the one (really wasn't he was a dickhead to me). 

And if he leaves me I'll go through with what I had planned back then. This isn't a threat to him. I want him to be happy. And if leaving me will make him happy then it's okay for him to leave me. I haven't told him that i feel this way. Suicidal again. Because I don't want to guilt him into staying with me.

But. Until he either breaks up with me. Or he doesn't. Ill keep trusting him. Ill believe everything he says to me. Every reason he isnt talking to me. I'll be there for him any time he needs me. And I'll keep telling him I love him. Cuz I do. He is my everything."
"Car almost hit me because of me and I feel guilty so I was walking at broken sidewalk next to road, recently it snowed and there was mud too so it was all slippy, when I tried to rotate to look at both sides of road, road is not big ao there is no zebra crossing, when I was rotating my body I suddenly slipped and without balance I almost fell and jumped at middle of road, there was car coming and thanks to his quick reflexes he pressed brakes on time and I did not got hit, he got mad at me and i did not said a word, I knew i deserved it, then I went to home, obviously it was my fault for not being careful but I feel guilty because I almost ruined his life, If he had hit me I at least would have broke any body part and obviously he would also feel guilty even if it was my fault, now I cant get it out of my head, what should i do, is there someone with same experience?"

"I feel so rejected. I was playing minecraft with my friend/crush and a bunch of people got angry at the people we were playing with. 

My friend acted a bit strange and he said he was under a lot of stress. I wanted to check up on him and maybe cheer him up a little so I send him a DM about me being worried about him shutting himself off from overybody.
I think he was still angry though, because he basically told me he also wanted to shut himself off from me.

"(Response to a deleted post): I drew you a thingDear reddit user who deleted their recent post:

(Iâll message them this post but didnât want to use their username in case they decided they wanted to keep it private.)

Iâm so sorry youâre feeling this way - I think deep loneliness is one of most painful feelings a person can experience. Being understood and feeling connected with other people is a very strong human need, and it sounds like your feelings of aloneness are causing you to have serious suicidal thoughts. (Idk if youâve seen r/lonely/, but you're not alone in being alone. Maybe this isnât exactly âcomfortingâ to know that so many other people are suffering like you, but it does mean you are very human -- we all have this need for connection, understanding, and love in common.)

\--

Disclaimer: Iâm not a mental health professional, just a random internet person, but as someone whoâs had my own struggles with suicide, these are some thoughts:

Iâm concerned that you are having significant suicidal ideation. I see suicidal thoughts as emergency alarms screaming at you that you need immediate help - if you have anyone you live with/anyone you can trust enough, please tell them how youâre feeling. It sounds like you would benefit from talking to a therapist asap, but if thatâs not possible for any reason, maybe try a suicide hotline? (Iâve heard that hotlines arenât always the best, but theyâre better than nothing, since at the very least they can refer you to some more resources.)

\--

Life is extremely unexpected, and there are never any guarantees. That being said, as long as youâre alive, thereâs always the possibility that you can experience new things, both good and bad. I think being able to trust and freely share all your thoughts with someone else (ideally a good therapist) can help, and can speed up the process of learning how to build closer relationships. (Maybe this isn't the healthiest thing/good to share, but I used to think of suicide as a backup that I often ruminated on when I didn't see any other options, but recently Iâve been finding that thereâs basically always other options you can try first, even though it really, really doesnât feel that way when youâre so suicidal. If you have Any other options, you have nothing to lose by living a bit more and trying them first.)

Iâve been in a drawing mood recently, and made a small drawing of a person in a warm house, looking out at a bridge. I hope you stay inside tonight, and Iâm optimistic that youâll find times of peace during life.

Hereâs the drawing:

"My best friend saved my lifeI have suffered from depression for a while now, and have had thoughts of ending it. But a few days ago, I decided I was going to do it.

I was on my break at work (I'm a cleaner) and I just decided that I was going to go to my cart, take the toilet cleaner from inside, go to the nearest cupboard and drink the whole bottle.

I got out my pen and paper and started to write my note. But, then I got a text from my best friend.

She was just texting to ask how my day was going. She knows I suffer from depression and wanted to make sure I was OK. It's like she knew what I was going to do, even though she had no idea.

And just like that, all thoughts of ending it left me. It's like it just melted away. I realised that I can't kill myself, because I know that she would blame herself. She's that kind of person.

She saved my life, and had absolutely no idea that she did. I really want to thank her for it, but I'm kind of afraid to tell her because I don't want to upset her. I want to tell her how much her friendship means to me. How much I love her.

So, I'm gonna ask you lot a question. Do I tell her?"

I can't function in everyday social situations to save my life and everyone at my job thinks I'm stupid. I literally heard one complaining to my boss about how useless I am. I can't fucking do this anymore. I know this is cringey as fuck but I just literally feel like there's no place for me in society. So many people are so fucking lucky and ungrateful for the things they have. I just wish the nukes would fly already because none of this shit is worth saving."

"Don't know my optionsHi guys, so right now I am in process of waiting on my marks for a course which would determine whether I meet my progression requirements or don't. I don't know if I will be allowed to stay in my degree if I fail the course. Asides from that everything else around me has just started to pick up. I am doing good extra-cirrcular wise, i got the job i always wanted and my family life is starting to do good as well. 

So if I get kicked out of degree, it all comes to an end. If I do fail I know of pretty tall building where I will just get shitfaced and jump. I need this degree. Everyone will laugh at me and I will lose everything. Maybe I could even move to the states and just shoot myself. 

I don't know what my options are. There is too much at stake. Someone please try to help me cope with the anxiety. "
I want to kill myselfI am a complete and utter disappointment to my family and Iâm only 14. I honestly would kill myself but I canât get my hands on a gun. This is pathetic. Why am I even posting about this. I donât know.

"My life is garbage. I want to give up.I can't do it anymore. I'm tired of always being the loser of the game, I don't know how many people here feel this same sentiment but I'm a complete loser and my life is garbage. I have nothing.

I'm depressed 

I'm ugly

I'm fat

I have no friends

I'm failing in school

I will likely be going into foster care soon

I can't go outside anymore without panicking because I can't get myself together

There's literally nothing left for me. I tried before and it didn't work out, it never works out for me. You're either born into something good or you're not. Everything is dictated by what you were born into, what you look like, and what you have. I don't have anything, what I got were abusive parents, depression, bullies, and worst of all myself.

I'm the root of all of my problems and it's much too late to fix them now. If I just disappear it won't hurt anymore, I'll finally be free from myself anf this world. I hope you all can find something to keep you here, I hope you all have something."
"we have a class pet my classmate made a a big ball of tape in art, shoved a pencil sharpener into it, drew a face on it and named it harold, and now we take him on walks, feed him pencils,  and talk to him.

"Most everyone here is asking for reasons to live. Here are mine, please add yours I posted on here a few nights ago about my suicidal thoughts. The positive responses from everyone surprised me and I am so thankful for all of them. Since then I've been on this sub every day talking to people that are in the same boat I am, trying to get them to continue on. If I can't save myself, maybe I can save others. That is one reason to live. Below is a list of other reasons, and please post more! If you need reasons to live, pick one or a few of these and focus on it. Don't give up!

1. Live for yourself. Live for no other reason than to see who you become. It doesn't matter what you do, who you know, what your hobbies are. Live so that you can feel how satisfying a full breath of air feels in your lungs. Live for the curiosity of what tomorrow may bring. Live for the now. 

2. Live for knowledge. Intelligence is a value that, unlike most, benefits yourself more than anyone else. Sure, it will get you places in this world, but it will, more importantly, allow you to change your perceptions as you learn about other cultures, science, history, art, or whatever interests you. 

3. Live because as I, a person who helplessly posted in here the other night, write this I'm forcing myself to think up reasons to live. You all made a person that wanted to die think of reasons to continue. You make larger impacts on this planet than you currently believe. 

4. Live to afford yourself the opportunity to move on from past injuries. Work on yourself. Change the mind sets you know are destructive. Focus your energy on healing yourself so you can be accepting of the person that you are. 

5. Live to see the simplicities of life that others never notice. Lay down in the grass (although its winter and cold) and observe the tiny insects within the blades. What are they doing? How do they interact? Do they think or communicate? Feel the wind brush along your face. Notice the pigments of color in nature and how the trees rhythmically sway on a windy day. Look up at the stars and imagine the possibilities that are out there. 

6. Live for the strength you will have once you overcome this, because I know you will. Having worked up from the depths of depression to the highs of appreciating life will make you so much stronger and wiser. You will look back and thank yourself for continuing on. 

7. Live for the fact that humans are the product of billions of years of evolution. We are so perfectly adapted to our environments and we are wired to survive. Survival is instinct. 

8. Death is permanent, life is not. Appreciate it while you can. 

Get rid of the bad in your life and allow the good to flow toward you. It will come, I promise. Live because you want to. You came here for help and i think that means you want to find reasons to stay. Live to find those reasons, whatever they may be. "
Day 218 of writing something positive that happened to me today Found a video of the principle of my school in a weed suit
"Stuff that Iâve been thinking about a lot       My crush doesnât like me back. After a lot of thought I realized she doesnât like me. Most girls in my class like my best friend. As soon as he walks in the classroom all the girls start yelling at him just asking random things.
I have a couple of classes with my crush and my best friend, and she always laughs at whatever he says.  Iâm not sure if she really like him but def not me. 
       Another thing is my friends are kinda shitty. It feels like Iâm always starting a conversation with them and inviting them, but they donât ever try to do the same with me. My best friends also really cocky. He thinks very highly of himself and brags to other people. Itâs really annoying.
      Since Iâve said stuff negative about other people I should probably say something negative about me. Iâm pretty sure Iâm annoying. Like I have an annoying personality. 
   Anyways, please comment giving advice/feedback."
Thinking of ending it againI've lost all my friends because my shitty depressed self decided to finally push them all away because I don't deserve them. I've barely moved from my bed for the last few days and i've been doing nothing but sleep. Thinking of finding the tallest building in town and just hanging up there until I get the nerve to finally let myself fall. Sounds like moms going to be out for temp job sometime soon.... may do it while she's gone. She deserves so much better then me...

Want to DieI feel like I have no purpose in life. I'm thinking of attempting to commit suicide tomorrow by crushing Vicodin and taking it with alcohol. I may break up with my boyfriend first because he hid something that devasted me. My best friend left me and one of my good friends is moving. I feel like I have only one other friend to talk to. I don't want to talk to my parents so I just stay in my room and sleep and cry. 
"Guys I did it! Despite my parents' best efforts, I turned out to be a disappointment."
"iI will go through long periods of being normal and functional and not having any symptoms or negative thoughts.

Then I am thrown into the negative/unhealthy thoughts and my symptoms start coming back. This is one of those times where it has come back. When I am functioning and ânormalâ and I look back on myself when i am not being normal, itâs like looking back on a different person. Looking back I know how crazy and annoying and weird the things i think are.

Now that i am back in this mindset I feel crazy. But mostly iâm frustrated. I am beyond frustrated I am like this. On good days I can convince myself iâm normal and i was just going through a phase. However, in times like this i am reminded that i am sick and this will always happen. I am not normal. It feels like a hidden sickness that I have to work so hard to hide from everyone. I am disgusted and disappointed in myself. I wish I could always feel ânormalâ. Now day to day I am exhausted and I feel alienated and alone."
I need to dieMy brain tells me I need to die. At this point I have achieved everything I possibly can. Its all just going to be downhill from here. I lack motivation to do anything any more. All I want to do anymore is drink eat and lay in bed with my kitty.

"My fiancÃ© killed herself. I donât know what to do.I was always the one with thoughts. I talked about it a few times a week. I thought about it a lot. She never mentioned anything like it. One day I got back from work, and the bedroom door was locked. I had to break down the door, and I found her in our closet. No note. No anything. Just her. I donât know why. I donât know what happened. And now my entire life is gone. She didnât sign her will, so everything that we owned is going to her parents. Everything we bought together is gone. I had to move out because I canât be there anymore. I now live at my moms house with some random bed and a few things her family didnât take out of the apartment. Theyâre blaming me, and are doing everything they can to cut me out of their lives. Theyâre even trying to sue me for her engagement ring. I donât know how much longer I can do this. I need some help. I have a trauma therapist next week. I still have our dog. But Iâm gone. The me who I was is gone, other than the feelings I had before."

I moved recently to a place where i have no friends, knowledge of the town and i am supposed to complete my studies here for next three years.I think i cant do it.

"I really wish I did kill myself.About 7 years ago I got the whole hospital intervention shit because I was suicidal. I decided to live because i really thought if i improve things about myself, my life would improve as well. Putting drugs and self-harm behind me has yet to help me in any way, in fact I'd say im boring now if anything. At least I was interesting as a fuckup, and could say i was having fun, albeit in a terribly unhealthy way. People really told me life would be better if i shaped up, i feel like ive lost a large part of my identity and really just dont know how to be happy anymore. Im so fucking empty. Now im just your average community college loser with no real world experience, and a laughable job. I have no interests that dont include dying. I swear if i could know that my life would be so monotonous and devoid of improvement i would have killed myself right then and there at 16. Thanks to both my stupidity and the wonderful background checks, i have to die in a painful way because i cant just buy a gun to blow my brains out. Im a fucking coward. Too pussy to just open my veins. I used to cut a lot, really deeply too. Now im just tired of hurting. I only hurt myself in angrr now when i would otherwise hurt somebody else, and im incurring real injuries to my head and wrists due to high impact. I really wish i didnt wake up this morning or would just have a heart attack and keel over. Every night i wish i dont wake up, every single one."

Better load up with protection cause Iâm gonna infect this mother fucker. And no you ainât my dad so stop acting like it Iâve left the groceries on the table."
"Was it attempted suicide?I'd unbuckled my seat belt, turned off the lights, placed my hands in my lap, pressed the gas, and closed my eyes. I'd hit 98mph before taking the wheel again(I had opened my eyes). I know this because my speedometer was broken and had a gps in its place. In my mind I was going to ""let"" myself die. People knew I always wore my seat belt and this would be ""the one time I hadn't"". Maybe I'd be a cautionary tale. Was this attempted suicide? 

Edit: this was on a county road with no other drivers around. There were steep hills and tight curves, with forest either side. "
I'm happy people! Today we had to bring at school the chinese homework we had to do. We had to write in chinese about the most beautiful girl/guy in the class. I know it's a very stupid homework but I've heard one of my classmates saying that the new girl in the class wrote about me... I think I've heard it correct (or maybe my mind likes to tease me). Well... I'm happy :-)

"What do I do here So me and this girl have been talking for about  month and have hung out a few times and weâve also each said we liked each other. But about 3 days ago on her snap story she posted a vid that goes like this-

Girl 1: âHe seems really different..Like he actually likes meâ

Girl 2:âWe never learn..Weâve been here beforeâ

My question is do I bring this up because it definitely seems like itâs about me or do I just not talk about it.

Sorry in advance for grammar."

To C-   I hope you make it as a writer, youâre like my brother. We used to talk about game of thrones , novels, and girls for hours. Those were simpler times, better times. Never blame yourself, you always had my back.

To J-  Stay off the drugs and keep skating. Who knows? You might go pro.
 
To I- I remember the love you gave me. I remember how you made me feel, it was fucking amazing.

To T- I understand why you did it bro, and I forgive you. We were so fucked up, but we were just kids. We didnât know any better. If I knew your pain, I would have told you I loved you more and been more patient. We were just stupid kids

To N- You tried your best to help me, Iâll always love you. 

To E- please stay perfect, donât let the world change you. Youâre going to rule the fucking planet. If I wasnât the best older brother, Iâm sorry. I love you like youâre my own kid.

To dad- You werenât the best man or husband, but you were the best father. This isnât your fault, itâs mine

To mom- I fucking love you, words canât explain it. I hope we meet again. Heaven is your embrace. This is my fault, not yours. 

To that little girl- Youâre a mirror to my soul

To all the people Iâve hurt- Iâm sorry, Iâm fucking sorry, Iâm fucking sorry, Iâm fucking  sorry. 

To God and the angels- I tried my best, please forgive me. Iâm still hoping youâll save me.

When itâs over, I hope I spend eternity in a beautiful Forrest with a clear view of the stars.  I hope I live carefree like a child again. I hope I get to hug my mum again.

I know I donât have the balls to do it, but life is pushing me. Maybe Iâll live and look back at this as a bad dream. 

If youâre reading this, fight for as long as you can, then fight some more. Then when you canât fight some more try to find someone to fight for you.
Follow your heart. Donât judge and donât hate. You canât run away from your heart, or your shadow. The past and future DO NOT exist, so be here now. Feel how your heart beat, follow itâs rhythm, hear the earth under you, and watch as your thoughts come and go, Canât you feel how peaceful it is? 

I donât even know what Iâm saying anymore, but letting all this out feels good."

do you like violence?

wanna see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids?

wanna copy me and do exactly like i did?

try ketamine and fucked up worse than my life is?

my brain's dead weight, i'm tryna get my head straight

but i cunt figure out which kardashian i want to impregnate

and Mr.Tripp said ""Ketamine, you a basehead.""

""uh uh""

""then why's your face red, man? you wasted.""

well, since age 12 i felt like i'm someone else

cuz i hung my original self from the top of the bunk bed with a belt

got pissed off and ripped pamela lee's tits off 

and smacked her so hard i knocked her clothes backward like kris kross

i ate a fat pound of ass, and fell on the grass 

faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast

cum here, slut; ""ketamine, wayment that's my girl dog""

idgaf, God sent me to piss the world off!

my engrish teacher wanted to have sex in junior high

the only problem was, my engrish teacher was a guy

slapped him across the face with a brick

stabbed him with a stick

stapled his nuts to the tip of his dick

walked into a strip club, had my jacket zipped up

flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup

extraterrestrial, killin' pedestrians, rapin' lesbians

while they're screaming ""let's just be friends!""

99% of my life i was lied to

i just found out my mom does more ketamine than i do 

i told her i'd grow up to be a famous troll,

and never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down

never gonna run around and desert you

i found out about a spy at r/CultOfHornie

so i told him ""thanks for all the bullshit you started, normie""

stop the tape! this kid needs to be locked away!

Mr.Tripp don't just stand there, operate!

i'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die

i'll have to be carried to the cemetery and buried alive

am i cumming or going? i can barely decide

i just drank a lot of cum, dare me to drive?

all my life i've been very deprived

i ain't had a woman in years, my balls are too hairy to hide

clothes ripped like the incredible hulk

i shpit when i talk, i'll fucc anything that walks

when i was little i used to get so hungry i would throw fits

how you gonna breastfeed me, mom? you ain't got no tits!

i lay awake and try to succ myself in the bed

it would hurt my spine and cut off circulation to my head

i'm steaming mad, and by the way, when you see my dad

tell him i slit his throat in this vision i had

"I feel like I'll never find a purpose for my life. Like I'll never find something that makes me happy....I just always feel unhappy and when something does make me happy it just never works out. I like this girl and I'm a girl. I think she likes me but I doubt it. I feel like I'm just gonna break if i get rejected tomorrow. I'm not gonna confess just ask if she could take me home after work. I just wanna talk to her and get to know her. I feel calm and at ease with her. But I'm scared because I know she won't understand me. I've been through a lot. I'm always back and forth with depression. I don't have anyone that understands it. I just put it in the back of my head and ignore it. I just don't feel like I'm gonna ever meet someone who truely understands me and loves me especially because i can only fall in love with females. I was in a relationship with a guy for 3 years and he just used me. Manipulated me did everything he could to keep me chained down. But at that time i thought i should settle down and just accept it. i'm not with him anymore cus I just wanted to find happiness if it exist but with who I am I honestly don't believe I'll find it. I've been depressed all through my childhood for as long as i can remember. I just feel like i can't stand it any longer just want it to finally end. My body issues drive me crazy physical and mentally. I just wanna find a loving girl thats real. But it's always about sex. No matter who I'm with even if they understand me 100% its just about sex and satisfaction for them. I'm just so sick of it. I feel like I'm completely alone I feel like I just always watch happiness of others from the sidelines while I stand here alone and unhappiness for most likely the rest of my life because thats all I've ever felt is pain and suffering. Am I really suppose to just take it and suffer endlessly like my mom did? She gave everything to her religion it never did anything for her. No matter what I feel I'm bound to a life of suffering even when I go through life being positive people just throw it back at you and hate you even through its just fake happiness.... fake smiles fake hope.... This is why i held on to my first love for 10 years... she gave me something to fight for, a purpose even if it was unrequited even if it hurt. it was still better than feeling so empty.... just having nothing. I can have everything in my life cars money job etc and not feel happy I don't care about that stuff I never have. The only thing in my life that has ever made me happy was the feeling of love...wanting to protect someone with everything you have. I love that feeling but it never lasts.... I'm just lost, and truely suffering....."

Iâm 16, and yes, to most people theyâll just think this is a phase now. but itâs not. i wish it was just a stupid fucking âedgy angstyâ phase but itâs more than that. Iâve felt this way since middle school (junior in highschool now). The first time I asked my parents for help, I asked to go to a therapist because I was feeling depressed. They did nothing. I asked at least 3 times after, still no help. The second time I ran to my dad, crying, and told him I wanted to kill myself. He told me he loved me, but after he told me, âyou donât feel that wayâ and told me that I was fine and should be happy because I have a good life. i still got no help. The third time I told my mom I need to see a therapist because I need help. She told me that I had no right to feel that way because I have a good life and loving parents. After this, I gave up asking for help from them. i went to a school counselor and told her I was overwhelmed with life and wanted everything to stop. She told me it made no sense why I felt this way because I had easy classes and my workload wasnât that heavy. I tried to explain to her it wasnât just school, it was everything, but she didnât listen. I told one of my friends how sad and depressed I feel, she told me to get out of my emo phase. I have been SCREAMING for help and Iâve tried so fucking hard to get the help I know I need but no one listens. I donât have many friends, Iâm very introverted and awkward, so itâs not like I have many people to go to other than the one friend I tried, who really is my only friend (although we donât even really talk anymore). I feel so alone and hopeless. Iâm ready to end it. I donât know what else to do I tried so hard to find help. I honestly believe if things donât get better within 2 years, iâm gone, if not sooner. im sorry for wasting your time with this post. i just needed to get everything out. im so fucking hopeless at this point.

Introduction

I'm going to try this again. The last time I made a post with the intention to uplift people, it got taken down. So what I'm going to do this time is tell my own story of how I finally got rid of my suicidal mindset. I'm not just some average normal-life-having Joe who comes on here and tells other people ""things will get better"" or ""suicide is selfish"". I come on here and I advise people not to kill themselves because I know what it's like to live your darkest night, but still able to make it out of the fire thanks to a glimpse of hope.  So now I'm going to start off by telling you my dark story and how I was able to make it out :

My Dark Past

I'm 24 years old and I've been suicidal on and off since I was 14 years old. Since then, I've tried to kill myself with over 6 methods and failed every time. I was in and out of the psych ward 3 times when I was 14, 15, and 16. I would refuse to take the pills and as a result, I'd get slammed on a seclusion matt and injected instead. I saw my dad get his cut throat by my 15 year old brother when I was 5 years old. I was suspended from school 4 times and expelled once. I tried to become a Marine but failed to even make it to the 2nd phase of training at Parris Island when I was 19. It was my biggest failure and definitely made me not want to continue living. I've been shot at and had unknown assailants try to kill me. When I was kid, I'd see my brother mistreat my mom (choking her). I got into my first relationship when I was 20 and got married to her at the age of 23. We just separated about 5 months ago and we're literally on opposite sides of the country now since she went to California. I was a cheater, a woman beater, a liar, etc. I used to come on this subreddit and advise other people to go through with killing themselves. I would try to mess up other people's relationships. I have 3 stab wound scars my chest area from when I tried to stab myself in the heart at 16 years old. Just a month ago, I had a noose hanging in my closet and was serious about ending it. Despite applying to jobs, I'm still unemployed and I still live with my mom.. but guess what....

The Rose That Grew From Concrete

I still made it out the fire and I'm glad that I didn't kill myself. I now realize that I do have a purpose in this life. I now realize that things CAN get better. Things won't get better if you say that wont. And with this new mindset that I've adopted, I now realize that I'm not a waste of space. I realize that I'm actually a blessing to this society. I'm a gift to this world. Whereas before I used to sulk in my bedroom and stay in the house all day, I go outside and I work out at a local playground. I write and record music. I still don't have a job, but I'm scheduled to do a physical test tomorrow because I applied to become a police officer. If I pass that test, I'll get an interview. And I just went out and bought some new dress shoes and I'm feeling really good about life. I got a new haircut and I'm feeling really good about myself now. On Oct. 19, I'll be security at a domestic violence event. On top of that, I admitted to my wife that I was the reason why our marriage failed. We actually became friends again and we can talk to each other without arguing. As you can see, things are going a lot better in my life... but how did I get to this point?  I'm going to tell you how to get out of the situation you're in by telling you how I was able to get out of my situation. 

How I Made It Out The Fire &amp; How You Can To

When you're depressed and suicidal, you don't think clearly. It seems as if things will never get better. It appears as if nobody cares. It appears like you're a waste of people's time and space. It seems like you don't really have a purpose. All these negative things are just illusions that your mind create. And illusions can appear to be very real, when they really aren't. The dark feelings are real, but the circumstances aren't always real. Somebody may say ""Everybody has different circumstances"", which is very true. We all have different reasons for wanting to kill ourselves... it may be because your lover left you or because you're physically disabled. But two things we all have in common is our lives being filled with negative energy and a lack of hope that things will get any better. 

The things that helped me to get out of depression and my suicidal mindset were :

1. \- Reaching out to other people : I was very open with my plans to take my life. I was determined to do it and it was obvious that nothing was going to stop me this time. But I've been an open person and someone who shares his personal life anyway because I just didn't care about what people had to say about it. My family knew about it and my friends knew. When I went to my sister and told her, I was called selfish and told that I was just seeking attention. She also called me a coward. The noose hanging in my closet disagreed with her, but she didn't know it was there and she didn't know I was serious.. Luckily, there were other people I had already reached out to who listened and gave me great advice.. it just wasn't enough to stop me from going through with it because my determination was too strong.... but it did contribute to me getting out of that mindset eventually.
2. \-Prayer : You may be thinking, ""Really? Wtf is praying gonna do?"", but you'd be surprised. I don't follow any religion like Christianity, Islam, or anything like that. I don't believe in Jesus, but I do believe in God. And when you're at your lowest and there's literally no glimpse of hope, who are you going to call? A therapist? Yourself? The police? A mental hospital so that they can give you some pills that aren't going to work? I'm not saying that you HAVE to believe in God and I'm not here to convince you that God is real. But just pray about it. Even if you don't believe in God or feel like you're wasting time, just pray about everything and ask God to help you to get out of the situation that you're in. What else do you have to lose? It doesn't hurt to try and if you're like me, you'll be surprised when it actually works. Throughout my last suicidal phase, I prayed to God about everything. I talked to God like God is anybody else. I told God about my problems and I asked God for help. For the most part, I felt like God was ignoring me and I'd get frustrated. Sometimes I'd curse at God, only to come back and ask for help again. Throughout this, I was practicing tying a slipknot and where to put the noose on my neck. Again, everyone has their own reason for why they wish to die.. My main reason was because I was still unemployed. Plus, not having had a father in my life, I still didn't know what the answer to being a man was and I told God, ""If my idea of what being a man is all about is wrong, please tell me the correct answer."" About a week later, I placed in an application to work at a local Gaming store and told others that I was going to kill myself at the end of September if I wasn't hired. I was determined to go through with it. Then one night I had a dream that it was a beautiful day and out of nowhere a tornado formed and picked me up off of the ground and the dream ended with my still in the tornado. Shortly after I woke up, it's like the answer to all of my problems hit me out of nowhere (no pun intended- like the tornado). It was like not knowing the answer to 2 +2, but suddenly knowing that the answer is 4 without anyone telling you. It was a miracle. I suddenly knew what the exact definition of a man is. A man isn't somebody who acts tough or who can have sex with lots of women; nor is he somebody who has a bunch of money. A man is somebody who does the right thing with good intentions. His aim is to do good for the world and there's so many ways he can do it. And once I knew the definition of what a man is, this was enough to give me hope to live. Immediately, I no longer wanted to kill myself or die because I had discovered my true purpose in life.
3. Doing The Right Thing With Good Intentions : I'm going to go back to a point that I was trying to make earlier. Earlier, I stated that people have different reasons and circumstances for wanting to end their lives... but one thing that all have in common is that our lives are filled with negativity. When I was suicidal and filled with negativity, I gave away negativity to other people. I had a YouTube channel and I used to make videos where I'd say some of the most hateful stuff. I'd say racist stuff. Instead of taking responsibility for my mindset, I'd blame other people. I see it all the time here. A bunch of selfish people who blame the world for their problems--- and no, I'M NOT SAYING THAT SUICIDAL PEOPLE ARE SELFISH FOR WANTING TO COMMIT SUICIDE (before a moderator comes along and assumes I'm calling all suicidal people selfish). I'm saying that they are selfish because they tend to focus on blaming the world for their problems instead of giving to the world. They succumb to their darkness and loathe in their negativity instead of doing good for others. They complain and typically don't get up and TRY to fix it. On top of all this, they typically come on here and tell other people how they are a waste of space and how they're good for nothing and call themselves a loser. If you call yourself a loser, what difference would it make if I call you one? If you call yourself a nobody, then you ARE  a nobody because you're you and that's the illusion that you choose to see of yourself. The only way you'll stop being a loser and a nobody is when you choose to stand up and do something about it and I'm here to tell you how I was able to stop being a loser and a nobody : When your life is full of negativity, give positivity to other people. Earlier I stated that a man is somebody who does the right things with good intentions. Since I know this, I willingly go outside and I pick up litter off of the ground because my intent is to save the environment- the plants and the animals. I pray for other people (especially people who have harmed me some way in the past) with the intent of God blessing them. I come on this subreddit to give advice to suicidal people with the intent to give them hope and to save lives. I've continued to do this and I can already FEEL the negativity in my life being replaced with love. Sometimes I come on here and as I try to give hope to someone who's at their lowest, tears come to my eyes because I'm praying that God will help me to come up with words that will help that individual to change his mind because I know what that individual is capable of even through the computer screen when they don't know. Just earlier today, I offered to give a ride to somebody who I saw walking because I wanted to help them to get there quicker. The guy declined my offer, but it still added more positivity into my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

CONCLUSION

Take my advice and things CAN get better if you allow them to. Some suicidal people hear the advice, but don't actually  listen to it. Some believe that things will never get better, so things don't get better. Some believe that they will never amount to being anything other than a loser, so a loser is what they are until they finally stand up and decide to do something about it. 

""Oh, I don't do anything productive with my life. I feel like a loser""-  SO GO OUTSIDE AND GIVE SOMEBODY A HUG WHO LOOK LIKE THEY NEED ONE. THAT'S BEING PRODUCTIVE. 

""Oh, I have anxiety. I'm scared to go outside and talk to people"" - Sometimes it takes courage in order to climb a mountain. Start small. Go out and say hey to someone. Then the next day, try having a conversation and so on. Practice may not make perfect, but it will definitely get you to a better place than where you are now.

My advice can only do so much. One has to WANT for his life to get better and has to do something about it. You can't expect for your body to get clean in the shower if you just stand there looking up at the shower head thinking about donuts lol. A dirty room isn't going to clean itself. 

I hope and pray that this post can change somebody's life... And if it doesn't change somebody's life, maybe it can cause the spark that can lead to your life changing and going in that positive direction."

"Have to get out some stuff, suicidal issuesBeen dealing with wanting to kill myself for a while. It has been more prominent in the last two years. But it has always been a desire since I was a kid. I have cut myself. I feel I am not adequate as a person. I have some reasons why (which are also reasons why I want to kill myself). I want to get these things out.

-Because I was a very shy and pussy of a person, I let my friends dump my one friend in elementary school. She was basically a loner for a while after that. I did apologize to her as an adult and even though everything is better and we are friends, I still feel horrible.

-Cheated on my ex, with 4-6 different people (I have a really hard time remembering the number because I am actively trying to forget). It's a lot to explain so I can basically save it for /r/confessions. I have apologized to him about and told him everything. My current boyfriend also knows but accepts me. 

-I have social anxiety, mostly when it comes to jobs. I very much want a job like cleaning but weirdly enough it is very hard to get, so I am starting a semi-social job this weekend and am worried

-I have a law issue to deal with...basically lawyers are telling me I need to give a certain company a somewhat large sum of money (that I most definitely do not have)

-I hate my mother so much, with so much severity, although she has never really wronged me. I know many daughters hate their mother but it is the type of hate the penetrates my very being. Will become relevant in a minute.

-I think my father tried to kiss me when I was a child but I am not positive

-I have so many secrets. When I read reddit posts about ""bad things you have done"" and stuff, I feel like the stuff I have done is way worse and embarrassing....I also feel like I think differently than most people, almost in an anti-social personality disorder type of way. Like I have to constantly remind myself or check with myself if my ""real feelings"" match the answers of others (if they are socially or morally appropriate), and often they do not.

I have cut myself a few times, not necessarily to kill myself, but to hurt myself to punish myself. Also getting 'close' to killing myself gives me excitement because I am almost living the fantasy of dying.  

Cut myself because, AKA notable times cutting myself that I remember having a specific causal event:

-mad at myself for getting kissed by a guy who was really drunk. It is so hard to explain but if you want to know the whole story I can tell it.

-So upset and pissed about the law issue, that is, owing a large sum of money to a corporation for something arguably not illegal but possibly illegal. I have very little money

-My mother truly and thoroughly irritating me so deeply I cut myself

Even though I have done everything I can to fix the mistakes of the past, I feel extremely guilty all of the time and inadequate. I know this is a really long post but I am a very detailed person, I can't help it. There is so much I am probably leaving out as well. I should also mention I have generalized anxiety disorder (and depression is a symptom). Anything else you want to know about me let me know...I am a very honest and AMA type of person. If you want to respond or help me please feel free to comment.

"Doesn't matter the help I get, the stressful headaches and depressive episodes won't go away.I just want nothing more than not to feel like the way I do. I get constant pains in my head that brings me into suicidal thoughts and no matter what prescription I take or therepy I have it won't go away.

I've made it routine at work to hide away for 10, 15 or 20 mins to recollect myself because I cant cope with myself. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I constantly feel upset waking up on an afternoon because I'm alive. I just want to be dead.

I bought myself a backpack and filled it with equipment to kill myself when I head cross country by myself. I've gathered everything i own and treasure and I'll be dropping them off to others when I leave this weekend. I dont want to be here at all anymore."
"Chronically ill. Suicidal.Sorry this is kind of long. I just have a lot to say and nobody in real life will listen. 

Iâm chronically ill with, what my doctors call, a severe case of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. All of my joints dislocate on a daily basis, sitting too long will cause fabrics to rip into my skin, standing up makes me blackout instantly and I hit my head regularly because of this, I can no longer walk and use a wheelchair to get around, I have a problem with literally all of my organs from this, and Iâm constantly in pain. There is no cure for this shitty disease I was born with. As of this year, I canât drive anymore without vomiting or falling asleep. 

Since itâs gotten worse this past year, Iâve been struggling in school. Since I have accommodations through my universityâs Accessibility Resources, I have excused medical absences and no late penalty for assignments. However, all of my professors tell me to drop out since I havenât been able to attend the last two weeks. Even before I got worse recently, they always keep trying to ask âwhatâs wrong with meâ and Iâm not comfortable sharing that with them and itâs incredibly awkward. Additionally, theyâd always call me out in class and say shit like âI know this makes you uncomfortable, [name],â or âWould this work for you? I know you canât walk.â I donât know if theyâre actually trying to be helpful but they make me feel singled out in front of 30+ people. One professor even keeps trying to meet me outside of class to talk about my âmedical issues.â Accessibility Resources is in the midst of dealing with all of those problems, since I canât deal with this anymore myself but itâs going nowhere. 

Iâve been diagnosed with Major Depressive disorder with psychotic features. Another doctor says Iâm probably autistic on top of that but I canât afford testing, since my insurance generally only covers 1% for procedures. They covered $17 of my brotherâs $15k sleep study. I see psychiatrists, therapists, rheumatologist, occupational and physical therapists, cardiologists, gastroenterologist, a connective tissue clinic, and neurologists. Iâve been seeing these people, from three different hospitals, for years now. Iâm just not getting better. 

Iâm going to have to drop out of college since I canât get to my classes or do any of the work. I have to quit my job because I canât get to work. However, this job is waiting to fully hire me (with benefits and better health insurance) when I get my degree, since Iâm two semesters away from graduating. But Iâm throwing that all away since I literally canât leave my bed. 

Iâve always been suicidal since I was ten and was constantly in and out of psych inpatient units. Since 2010, Iâve tried to kill myself 20 times. The last time I was in an inpatient unit (last year), one of the male nurses pressed his erection into my back, and I can barely go into hospitals anymore because Iâm just terrified of male doctors and nurses now. 

Iâm on ten different medications for a myriad of reasons and none work as intended. 

I donât have any friends, at work or from school, so I donât have anyone to talk to or get help from. I lost all of my friends within the last year because theyâre âtired of being friends with someone as disabled as [me].â 

Last time I called 911 for assistance, they tried to put me in an inpatient unit, but chose not to after explaining what happened last time and that Iâm actively seeing doctors on a weekly basis. 

Iâm at a loss and feel permanently stuck. 

When I drop out, Iâll lose all of my scholarships and grants and wonât be able to even do part time. So college is pretty much over for me, even though it was my favorite thing to do. 

I donât plan on living much longer. Iâm done. I canât live like this anymore. Iâm so emotionally, physically, and academically exhausted. Iâm truly not meant to live normally in this world and Iâm tired of trying. I havenât left my bed in days and donât have energy to eat or drink. 

Thanks for reading this, if you did. Nobody bothers listening to me in real life, so I guess itâs nice posting how I feel here. 

TL;DR: Canât do anything because of physical illnesses, probably going to kill myself soon."

"I won't say life sucks, I think its just not for me.Hey I'm 18 years old and I've done a lot of stupid things.. otherwise I wouldn't think I would be here right ^^

Now. I do have a loving family, my parents try to support me in all my life choices my brother and I happen to like the same hobby and we have a lot of fun doing our hobbies together but..

Everytime I just look at the future, I don't see any reason to stay alive. there is no job that I really want, no education I want to follow. Everything is just so boring to me. Now I know I've said that I like doing this hobby but its no where near a realistic ""Job"" option. and I don't think its worth living for eather, 

 I can't be having 0 income so I have to do atleast something. but I cannot figger out what. I tried a lot of things and afthere some time I keep on dropping it. and now for next school year I've got nothing... nothing at all, no job, no school, no money, no plan... My parents can't understand it and there quiet mad at me for not finishing any education.

So now I'm left to do nothing all day. normaly I would be called crazy for complaining for not have to do anything, but for me its a an othere reason to kms.

As a mentioned in the beginning I've done quiet some stupid stuff, I basically lost all my friends over mistakes I've made, for example I once went to Japan with my 2 best friends but I was acting such childish and annoying that when we got back both my friend never wanted to talk to me again. 

Ive got noone, and Im mostly left lonely, so today I've desided that I will finally put a end to this. 

Good bye ^^ live a happy life."
"No one cares, it was all just a lie. Tomorrow is my birthday, and tomorrow I'm going to die.(an unintentional rhyme in the title, I'm not trying to be cutesy with this shit)

No one cares about me. Anyone who has ever said iso or told me otherwise was just lying, trying to comfort me or manipulate me. No one ever truly cared. I am so fucking disposable. I am absolute trash. I don't matter to a single person, and the longer I stay living, the more of a burden I become. 

Tomorrow is my birthday, and I am terrified to receive all the half-hearted ""happy birthdays"" out of facebook-notification obligation. I've planned for tomorrow to be my day to die for a while. 

I've been too depressed lately to do the proper 'clean up' that I wanted to do, but it just may not even matter anymore. It doesn't fucking make a difference. I'll just throw everything in trash bags instead of meticulously going through everything and be done with it. Then I'll finally fucking do it. Then a burden will be eliminated from everyone in my life. 

I keep grasping at straws, trying to find someone that I truly matter to, that truly cares about me and my wellbeing and actually loves me, but it was all just a facade, a mirage, fake. I wanted to feel loved so that is what I saw, but now I see the truth and it is so painful. It would make no difference if I disappear tomorrow other than people not receiving a 'like' on their  'happy birthday' to my facebook wall. Like they'll even remember they did it in the first place. 

&amp;#x200B;

After years of planning my death on the day of my birth, with something always getting in the way, I'm finally fucking over it. I'm ready to be gone. I can't bear this pain any longer. "

"Losing faith in everything...Hey... I'm an 18 year old female from Portugal...
My life 3 years ago was pretty much 'normal'.
Last year I won a lot of money from playing a game, one that I love. With that game I started trying 'snort' drugs, and legal snort drugs like ""Bloom"" in the beginning of 2011. I have quitted since then... I do still smoke a joint here and then.. but to the point, I learned a lot that year... Possibly more than I would want to, with money I could see first hand people I never talked with starting to be really nice to me and stuff... With money on the game it was the same thing... I got so sick of seeing the fakeness (spelling) in people... Anyway, in august I had a very rich bank on the game... After a lot of dedication, because yes it is a game, but to me it's a second life, and why not? A 'friend' in real life hacked me for its contents... That helped to my current state, not so much about the money... Just being backstabbed by someone I considered to be a good friend really sucks. Not mad, sad.
I tried suiciding once... Drinking bleach, but alas... A little puking after and I was fine...
When I was living with my mother things weren't easy, not expecting them to always be aswell.. But we got through. One day she gets home, mad I have no idea why, starts trying to start a fight... And succeeds, I have a temper too, and I can see when things aren't the way people try to make them be. Crucify me for not being like you...
Anyway.. she called the police... And I wasn't even scared because I knew I had done nothing wrong, when they got there I think they were expecting something mental by what my mom said on the phone to them, they just found a peaceful person... Anyway, they stayed on my side... I left the house with them, spoke to them a bit near the police car, and they gave me 3 cigarettes to spend the night... Brilliant I'd say.
I walked near my dad's house, spent the night in an abandoned house (because my dad lived with my stepmother, and we didn't really connect... So I doubt she'd like me knocking on her door at 4am.)
and I must say... I slept really well. The feeling of knowing your conscience is clear from guilt is one of the most important things for me. That's why I never lie either. I really don't, I see no need for it... Things are the way they are, and I'm ready to accept anything at all, for as hard as it is... Also, if I don't know something I don't pretend to... I simply admit I don't, so I can learn more...
Anyways, I went to my dad's in the morning... Talked to him about it, and he said he was going to try and talk with his wife... See if I could stay in the house.
I did... I got a job... and my best friend lived right across the street. Seemed like life was straightening (spelling) up for me...
Then, my stepmother gets in a fight with my dad... Asked for a divorce... And I'm like D: ?... Umm, probably the funniest part of this bit: I had admited to smoking joints towards them. There is nothing wrong with it... I'm not forcing them to do it, and it's my health/life, it actually helps me sometimes. But yeah.. I was in the computer one day she comes at me and says ""HOW COULD YOU?"" I said ""what? D:""
She dragged me to her 12 year old daughter's bathroom, pointer at HER SINK, where a little bar of hashish was, and accused me of bringing drugs into her house. like.. LOL? I NEVER carry drugs with me, when I do it's an individual ganja and to be smoked soon... And I would NEVER leave a bar of it on her daughter's bathroom sink... Seriously lol... My own dad didn't believe me at first... *sigh*
So yeah... I couldn't find the motivation to keep working... Knowing life was about to fuck me over again, so I left work... (earned 400â¬ which I let my dad keep recently for bills and stuff...)
I stayed in my ex-stepmother's garage with my dad for a week... Wasn't an easy week, mostly playing pokÃ©mon on my old trusty gameboy and listening to the radio... Not being allowed to go into the house itself.
My dad then found a house, with my aunt's help (she's great) we moved in... and it FINALLY seemed like life would give me a break... And it is better I suppose... But since living alone with my dad he's SOOO changed... I know people seem to change when they live together and I understand he's probably stressed out... But he stresses me out like this.. I've tried to talk with him calmly... He just tells me I don't do nothing right, that I have no goals in life, that I have no social life (no wonder... most people are shit and only care about money)... I just don't know what to do anymore... Wish I could just disappear... It hurts me even more, knowing that I am not a bad person... I don't even LIE for heaven's sake... I don't feel envy, I don't feel hatred... I only feel hate for what people can be...
They give no meaning to words, our primary way to communicate, they use them to manipulate others much like my stepmother did...
I HATE when I know I'm right and people try to walk over me... I just HATE it, and then I get accused of only doing crap, and when I ask ""What is it that I did exactly that got you so upset?"" the reply is ""You're not worth the time."" RIGHT....
A little (not really) tale about my life... and a few vents too... Hope someone out there cares to read, and understand. Maybe ask questions. I've just about given hope on mankind...
Sincerely,
Jade May"

"Tables Turned (149) When we go through the pain, the anxiety, the sadness, the darkness, the depression; everything that is constantly pushing us back and trying to push us down, **one day the tables turn.**

**One day, we get to the point where all the time, energy, effort, sweat, tears, blood &amp; our entire soul is seen by the Universe and given to us 100 fold. Until that day, keep pushing, keep going, its all worth it.**

The times we are going through can be difficult sometimes to find the energy to push through the day, to complete tasks and projects that have been created by us but then become a responsibility. Something that helps me is knowing when I am feeling tired and wanting to give up, **I take a step back. To reset. I go outside and breathe in fresh air to forget about life for a brief moment and just be.**

Everything that is being focused on right now is for something greater than we can even think of, that we expect, but the Universe already knows and thats all that matters to me.

**Keep going.**

**I love you.**

"It's the only option that's sure to make me happier than I am nowI can't handle my depression. Therapy makes me more and more anxious. I don't know myself. I can't discern my personality from what I think my personality should be. Being asked relentless questions about what makes me feel depressed results in me hazarding guesses that are certainly wrong but the therapists seize and run with despite my reluctance. I have no idea what I enjoy, I can't remember being genuinely happy rather than momentary pleasure. I can't see me taking any options in future other than suicide. It feels like my life has been about waiting for death for some time but frankly I can't be bothered to wait.

I'm posting here because I really don't want this to be my option. What reasons do I have for life? I can't see any beyond the standard cliches which I've already thought of. Help?"
"Nothing's going right and this is why I wish I was deadI'm still in school so I do normal things people like me do. I have to ride a bus because I just don't really have another choice right now and it's awful. Ive been bullied on the bus since preschool and it never stops, it only gets worse. Now that my little cousins, who are in fifth and second grade, are riding the bus, I have to stick up for them and myself. I was sticking up for them and got myself in a bunch of trouble and now I'm being threatened of getting kicked off and I honestly didn't harm or threaten or do anything to get kicked off. Everyone is bullying me right now and that's just the bus. I have to babysit my cousins and one of them will not sit still and that really makes me mad and bothers me. I leave the room and they follow and I never get a break. At school I take depression fits and just go to the bathroom and cry. No one likes me and they all call me a ""fat hippopotamus"" when they have nothing to talk about. I can't help my weight, I've went on starvation fits and I exercise every day I'm just made bigger and I can't help it. I make fat jokes about myself all the time so it doesn't bother me but it does. Then I like people like as a friend and my friends tell them that I love them and act all immature about the situation. My one friend who I thought was my best friend broke her ankle and had to miss school today, she constantly lies to me when i do belive her she turns around and it's a lie. I've cut myself for a year and everyone around me just tells me to stop that everythings fine when its not. They don't know what I deal with and every single day they add things that make me more stressed and make me want to die even more. I don't care about anything or anyone anymore. I'm ready for life to end. I touched on very few topics in this, but I still hate everything. "

"Some Advice for When It All Feels Like Too MuchFor a really long time, I had felt suicidal. One day, I made an attempt to kill myself, but since I didn't do any serious damage to myself, the hospital sent me home with my parents. After coming home from the hospital, I saw my dogs and thought to myself, 'If I died, what would happen to them?' Whenever your feeling down, just look at your dog, cat, fish, lizard, or whatever pets you have, and say to yourself, ""Who will take care of them if I'm not here?"" Animals will always love you, no matter what and will always be there for you on the days when life just ends up being too much to handle."
"Loneliness and nihilism making me suicidal.My loneliness has been leading to anger, which has led to sadness/depression, and now thoughts of suicide. 

Albeit I'm relatively young, any relationship I have tried before has failed. But, I want one - though every time I attempt one they fail. I have friends in *that* sense either, so I'm grasping for something that's not even there. 

I don't see why I shouldn't die. ""It's a permanent answer to a temporary problem"", but what if the problem is permanent? Or what if the problem is everything about you? Or what if the problem is the fact that you just want to leave because everyone else despises you? 

17 years of getting lied to, hated, failed relationships, and ignored. I don't know if I actually *want* to kill myself, I just question the value in existing. 

""Don't end your life, you're young and you can still do things and work toward the stuff you want.""

Except that I have the anger, and the dissent toward everyone around me. Those I don't want flock to me, and only anger and sadden me more. Those I want couldn't be farther away. 

I hate pity and have an ego, but I don't see the point in trying to maintain something that nobody else besides myself wants to take value in. 

I'm young, so if I end it here, I won't have to worry about what's ahead, like more failed relationships, sadness, loneliness, anger, and liars. It just ends.

I do it, I go away, I'm a talking point for a few weeks at home and in the school, and by October I'm forgotten. It's logical.

Therapy and ""help"" is embarrassing and expensive. I'd be ruined if I vented to anyone. Forced in some hospital for ""help"" I don't even consent to. It's not worth the burden. "
"I stood up to my abusive dad Well, today I finally snapped. For the first time I actually told my dad how I felt about him. I detailed how I feel constantly frightened about being around him and that I donât want to be around him.

I know itâs not much, but, for me, this is a huge moment, for once I actually spoke my mind.

Of course, he didnât take it well, jumping around different excuses, from accusing me of being mentally disabled due to the medication I take, to being brainwashed into hating him by my mum. 

Regardless of how he reacted, itâs a start for me being more independent and to not be forced to do everything he says."
"Nothing is rightNothing ever has been. Every time I try to do something, to make something of myself, it just gets all screwed up and I'm so so tired of it. It hurts and I think it would be easier to die than to watch myself go absolutely nowhere in life. I'm such a failure. "

"Guys, please read what I have to say. It will be worth your while. Sometimes, you may feel you have nobody to talk to at home or at school, or may seem powerless in your situation, like you can't change things no matter how hard you try. Especially children and teenagers, who's brain and body are still developing, and sometimes we don't know what we are feeling, or how to even handle certain situations. But I wanted to tell you. No matter what the situation is, you have the power to make a change, even if it takes some time.  I am going to make a change by being a psychologist, but I'm still a teen, and that is years and years from now, I haven't even entered college. Some things, you can change. Right now. But sometimes, we have no idea how. And sometimes, we have a hard time just adjusting to change. I wanted to let everybody know. You are not alone. You have the power to achieve your dreams.

Use this comment section to vent or rant about anything you feel you need to say, whether you think it is big or small. Me, or another kind person will reply. And if you feel you need to, you can PM me and vent or rant about anything you feel you need to let out, if you feel you truly have nobody else to talk to in your life, or even if you do, and you just need to get it out anyway. 


You matter, you are not alone, and you have the power to make change."

I have no money. My girlfriend kept telling me I should go kill myself. My friends are telling me I shouldn't and it's going to be okay. But I just feel like I have no talent and my life is over. 

I can't even think of what I'm going to do. I can't believe my managers are spinless and couldn't even do the firing themselves. They had a lady on the phone do it.

"From a girl: donât be a simp. So a while ago I met this guy on a minecraft server. I had a rank, he did not. We chatted through discord (text only, no voice calls) and he tried to make a move on me several times. I told him that I wasnât interested in a relationship, not only because he lived on nearly the other side of the world, and because heâs 2 years younger than me (Iâm 17, heâs 15). He still kept trying but I was clear from the start, I was only friends with him because I liked playing minecraft with him. He then proceeded to buy himself a rank and upgrade mine as well, this was entirely his own idea and choice. He then told me he spent all his money on me and STILL tried to get in a relationship with me of something?? No one forced you to spend $10 on a rank for me while I already had a rank and then try to guilttrap me because you spent reallife money on me.
I quit playing with him and we are no longer friends. 

If you get rejected, take the L and go. Donât spend any time or money on someone who isnât interested. Donât be a simp like this guy was because you might lose your friends. No one likes simps."

"My life is so miserable and the only way I keep myself afloat is through escapismI'm 16, I've been severely bullied for almost 2 years now, I've recently discovered a hate page that posts pictures of me with awful, disgusting captions that are used to entice older men. I have an abusive ex that hates my guts and leaked my nudes. I run the risk of running homeless because my father is so in debt with the utilities and he barely pays our bills. My mom has age-inappropriate expectations for me and treats me as if I'm her therapist, I'm expected to also juggle AP classes at school, study for my SATs and obviously do well. 

There is nothing redeemable about my life. There used to be, but now I cannot think of anything. The only thing that keeps me afloat is escapism, whether that's chasing after a crush or a partner, locking myself in my room for hours, listening to music, etc.. I am genuinely so miserable. I want to die, I really do want to die. I haven't thought about it in a while but that's because I always act like things aren't as bad as they really are. It's like, I might as well just give the people who bully me what they want. Fuck this dude."

"reddit is actually pretty fatphobic ""uGhH cRINgE wOrD"" oh just don't, i really don't care if it's ""cringe"". You wanna be treated like an adult? Act like one.

Anyways, reddit is fatphobic. I constantly see posts about fat people. Either its the 706th post on r/unpopularopinion saying ""uhhhh fat isn't beautiful"" or it's a post on r/trueoffmychest saying ""god obese people are disgusting"" (yes, those are real examples)

Um, don't do that? First off, no one with half a brain is going to tell you that fat is beautiful or healthy or whatever the fuck you want to complain about. That was a trend years ago but people thought and still think it's being pushed. It's not, it's just not. It died many years ago, tbh it was never alive. Second off, uhh its a bit fucking rude to say someone is gross and disgusting. I don't think you'd ever say that to their face?

You seriously don't need to tell people they're fat. They know. They aren't fucking stupid.

You don't know that person. You don't know why they are the way they are. 

Nobody is asking you to call everyone beautiful. Nobody. Shit, nobody is telling you to not think being fat is unhealthy. It is unhealthy and even fat people know that. But if you can't even have the decency to not be blatantly fucking disrespectful towards them, that is *your* problem."
Uh oh fellas I have to do a debate live on YouTube wish me luck guys
"Sheâs not even my best friend anymore...So this isnât really one about how Iâm depressed, but more about what my best friend did. We were best friends for 14 years. She moved states 3 years ago and never visited. We would always FaceTime, so I thought it was cool, until a few months ago. Out of nowhere, she stopped talking to me. 

I convinced my parents to let us visit her and I finally got to. Iâm here finally getting to spend time with her,
but the thing is, she hardly talks to me. She on FaceTime with multiple boys throughout the days, and always texting them when sheâs not on FaceTime. She doesnât spend time with me. 

 (TW: Killing and cutting) What even worse is that I havenât even told her whatâs going on with me. She started panicking because one of her many guy friends told her he had a random thought about killing himself, and she freaked. But I havenât told her that Iâve tried to kill myself twice already, Iâm addicted to cutting myself, and Iâve been diagnosed with depression. I wonder if she would react to what I say or if she would just ignore me, like she has been. 

I havenât seen her for three fucking years and I went through hell to convince my parents to let me go and visit her. This is what I get. I lost my best friend."

"Iâm gonna kill myself soonI have no friends, Iâm failing pretty much every subject in school and I spend all day everyday just sitting around alone doing nothing because I donât enjoy doing anything, I got diagnosed with depression and social anxiety a while ago and Iâm taking medication for it but it doesnât help. I also have thoughts going through my head all the time that make me feel sick too my stomach. Iâm just waiting for the next time my whole family goes out so that I can hang myself while Iâm home alone. Iâve been miserable for a long time and my life is going nowhere, I feel guilty about doing this to my family but I think it will be better this way. "
I need a vacation from lifeI am so fucking done. I can barely even function in life. I am so bad at socializing in general and i cannot live if i can't talk to people. If i could live at some deserted island clear of any human life i would. I want a break. Every moment is embarrassment. I hate myself and I hate everyone. If not having to deal with people means dying then please bring it on.
"Battling my own thoughtsFor as long as I can remember Iâve always had the thoughts of ending it. I have always just pushed them aside, battled through it on my own. Iâve never really talked to anyone about it, I talked to my partner (now ex) about it a little bit, she always told me that she would be there, we were together for 8 years. Now she says she doesnât love me, this hurts me a lot, all I want to do is end it, end my life, not because of the break up but because Iâm not sure I can do this anymore, Iâve been like this a long time. I finally went to my doctor about how Iâve been feeling, but she wants me to feel the pain of the break up, I told her that Iâve been this way for a long time for as long as I can remember still nothing. I went to a therapist but I feel like she just thinks itâs because of the break up. I admit the break up has triggered it back, but this time itâs worse. I sit and stare into thin air how Iâm going to do it. I then think who is going to find me, how long will I be dead for before someone finds me, I think about my ex and how much it would hurt her, I donât want her to feel like itâs her fault I donât want her to find me. Itâs not her fault, itâs mine I shouldâve got help a long time ago, itâs to late now. "
she is so bad for my sleep schedule wtf i already have trouble sleeping so this probably doesnât help that either but itâs nice that i have someone to talk to when i canât sleep. iâve been staying up wayyy later than usual now but itâs for a good reason at least
"Desperate, desolate and depressed.Xpost from /r/depression.   
I'm unsure if this is the right space to post it, but let me just start by saying that just a few days I thought of ending my life. I know what I'm going to do, and how I'm going to do it so that it will end quickly. I don't know what I'm seeking for here. Money? Advice? Words of encouragement? I really don't know. Perhaps anything. Perhaps nothing.

\- First official depression prognosis started since high school from bullying in 2007. Internalised homosexual tendencies.

\- Pre-college studies affected/delayed by a year, sexually assualted when doing national service where I was. Kept quiet because I'm a guy and it was by another man. Got properly diagnosed with general and social anxiety disorder. It happened too long ago, but scarred me deeply. I kept quiet and just kept it in.

\- Travelled alone for a bit and was okay, but university came, and felt like I was in the wrong place. Had multiple leaves of absences because I wasn't coping. Met some friends for life who kept me alive, met more than didn't stay. However, accummulated a high amount of student loan because of this. Currently on hiatus from university, even when I just turned 29 2 weeks ago.

\- Met the man of my life in university, went through 6 years and a lot of shit together. He was my beacon and support for the longest time. However, this guy left me because he felt like I wasn't going anywhere (which was because of inaction or lack of achievements caused by my depression) and he lost feelings for me. He was unable to empathize with my depression because of the way he was brought up, and saw it as laziness or just plain wasting my life away. He broke up with me late november in 2019 and I'm still not over him. This experience still has a leading impact on my mental stability. I ended up doing many stupid things after (some while heavily intoxicated), and I can say for certain that I sabotaged any lingering bridges between the both of us. He's not a bad person.

\- Family are not supportive of my sexual identity. As an asian family, there were high hopes and expectations on studies and success. Also we were mid-low class and we don't have much financial sustainability. My parents, they are not bad people. They work hard, but they are not highly educated. I had to learn a lot of things on my own. I have been supporting myself for the longest time, even if I still stay with my parents. We don't communicate much, the times we do are usually very abrasive, and I feel mostly isolated and alone.

\- Found my passion for the arts and drive in the media/broadcast tv industry through several career opportunities in the forms of external ad-hoc internships during the times when I was looking for something to do while on leave of absences. However, the lack of an official paper qualifications led them all going nowhere. The last stint ended in end of April when Covid got serious and I was let go because I was expendable. Ultimately, much experience, but very little income, and with my age, I'm unable to compete for entry level jobs with fresh graduates with the right qualifications. Besides, I have a lot of debts and no money to start another diploma or degree elsewhere, which is something at the back of my mind but never able to achieve. I have maybe $2k usd to my name in terms of expendable cash.

\- It has been roughly 3 months since I'm unemployed and not doing anything, and while I'm still on hiatus from university, I have to decide by the end of the year if I was to continue or terminate my matriculation. I'm in my final year, but I'm severely tormented with the idea of forcing myself through for something that I am not wishing to do in the future, and that it will take a further toll on my mental health. But if I leave, it would be years and money wasted. I have

\- Right now I'm juggling between part time work but even those are scarce and few, heavily strenous and I feel like it's not enriching. I've been sending out resumes and applications but always met with rejection. I tried seeking remote jobs as well like ways to sustain making money online, but always hitting a wall. I'm basically powering through just to earn some money to sustain myself, and it has been a struggle everyday.

\- I never thought I was unintelligent, but I think my low level of confidence, my inferiority complex, abandonment issues with the breakup, isolation from my family, my financial burdens and the hopelessness of not being able to go anywhere in life with so much potential, has caused me a lot of mental anguish. I struggle with sleep everyday, and I wake up everyday feeling worse, wishing I did better. I'd like to think if I was given another opportunity or more resources in life, I will have done much better and to never fall into this state. Alas, everything is always better in hindsight.

\- It's easy to say that you're comparing oranges to apples, but when I look at my peers or close friends around me, most if not all of them are in a better place than me. Maybe they were born in a better environment, maybe they have met supportive people in their lives, maybe they all chose wiser with what they wanted to do in life, and here I am, feeling stuck and incredously bopeless. I know, there is definitely someone out there who has it worse off than me, but the darkness is so overpowering that I do not know how to continue with life. I wonder everyday when is the day I will finally have the courage to choose to go so that I can relieve myself from this pain. I'm not okay. I wonder if you, reading this, have any resources or pearls of wisdom for me."
i really cannot do this anymorei feel like everyone is abandoning me. i feel like the stress is too much i canât handle life anymore i feel like i should be dead i canât trust anyone anymore i just want to die i just want to be gone because all i am is forgotten all i am is a loner all i am is nothing i just want to be gone i canât do this anymore i want to die I want to die
"Writing something positive about my day, day #291 (quarantined on my own day #1) Honest, so far Iâm kinda liking being quarantined. Iâm lucky in that I got to do it in a nice hotel and yeah. All the clothes I like have been packed for like a month before I actually traveled so itâs nice being able to wear what I want to again. Iâve only got a couple class on Saturday so itâs been a pretty chill day. 

The reason Iâm being quarantined is because I traveled from another country so I can attend the boarding school Iâm going to. Itâs for two weeks and Iâm on my own because my parents couldnât come with me."
"I need help but donât know who to turn toThis is my first time posting here and I need help. Iâm 16 and Iâve been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for a really long time, ever since I was 6, but have never had the stones to anything about it. I have these nightmares that are so violent that I literally donât want to sleep. My dad is also verbally abusive to me and my family so that doesnât help anything. I recently lost a really great group of friends because I said I was going to take my life. They had no concern for me after I said that and my girlfriend is really trying to help but what can she do, she is there for me when I need it most but she canât truly feel the I feel and on top of that I always feel alone and isolated, like I talk to my girlfriend everyday and she makes me the happiest person in the world, but yet I still feel alone. I could be in a room with a million people and Iâd still feel like the only person in the room. If you have any advice, please tell me, I donât know much more of this pain I can take."
"How often do other guys here sit on their balls? I have never once sat on them and it being an issue hasn't even crossed my mind, but something I saw referenced it and I'm curious if it actually happens to other guys"
"Hopeless and helpless*Sorry if my English and redaction is not that good*

I feel helpless, hopeless and abandoned, i just want do feel better but I feel like I have lost the only one person in this world that I trust, the only one who have been there for me every time I needed for three, she said that if I ever felt bad I could just tell her and she will help me, but I think I will just annoy her, this just happened yesterday, she told me she was feeling a little low and probably won't be able to talk to me for a time, and I know that's okay, but I don't have anyone to talk, I just don't want to be selfish but I just need to talk to her, I want to tell her all things I have been doing today because thats help me to get distracted of all the pain I have inside.

I have been thinking of ending my life today, but I don't want to die and I don't want to be selfish with her and just let her get better but at the same time I feel like I need her and don't know what to do, I have been crying for like half an hour, and I feel so stupid, I'm probably overthinking everything and this is not that bad but I can't control my thoughts."
Y'all ever feel so happy you just cry ya it be like that
I will play Smash or Pass All you gotta do is name a person (preferably a female) and Iâll respond with âsmashâ or âpassâ
I wanna die and I think Iâm going to tonightIâm constantly sad and depressed and no one fucking cares ppl say they do but theyâre lying. Theyâre fucking liars and Iâm so tired of feeling like shit 24/7. I canât get shot done in school and Iâm just a waste of space. I canât stop SHing every ducking night and Iâm so fucking done. Iâve tried telling myself that things will get better and Iâve come so far. But that doesnât work. Iâve tried so many reasons to stay alive but I canât find anything that works. Iâm a failure and a terrible person whoâd be better off dead. Iâm a fuck up and a mistake. Iâm sorry to the people who had the displeasure of knowing me.
"Why are people so fucking selfish?I donât get it. Iâve been getting out of my comfort zone and complimenting people. They just seem uncomfortable. I wish people would have more empathy. A good example of this is when a classmate committed suicide. There was a memorial held for him by a friend of mine, and guess what happened next week? No one talked about him since. Thatâs a reason why I canât do it. People genuinely donât care."
"crush on a boy i have a crush on this boy at school..and my heart beat so fast every time he comes close to me, i get frustrated and start saying dumb shit, at the locker room he always teases me i'm hoping he is atleast bi or something ): i want to do something i hate being closeted HELP ME PEOPLE OF r/TEENAGERS"
"Can't talk to anyone I know about this so here I amThursday night I didn't want to feel anything anymore so I downed some benzos I found in the house and got drunk. 
I blacked out and I can only remember small bits of the night like they were a dream. 
At one point in the night I got into my roommate's lancets and insulin and I began stabbing myself in the arm and face with the little lancets. I believe I injected insulin into myself as well since I woke up surrounded with the stuff.

Though I was still dazed I needed someone to talk to, I tried online support groups but no one would answer, so I called the suicide hotline wanting to talk
They didn't talk to me, they just called 911 on me.

Paramedics arrived, took me in, and after spending 5 hours in the ER they tested my blood and fed me. Found nothing physically wrong with me and sent me on my way. They offered to admit me for mental treatment but I said I couldnt, my roommate is out of town and I have 8 animals to feed.

Upon being released I had to figure out my own way home as I knew no one who could come and get me. 

The entire Friday was a blur and I've spent most of saturday sleeping and crying. I texted my mother saying I really need to go to the doctor ASAP 
I'm going to either have to tough out the last 3 weeks of classes or drop out of the classes so I can get treatment asap 

Until then I guess I'll see the school councelors 

I hate myself so much, my mom's father committed suicide 10 years before I was born. If I succeeded I can't imagine what that would do to her.

I want the pain to stop so bad, but I sit and think about the student loan my mother co-signed, my 9 year old cat that has separation anxiety when it comes to me, the cost of a funeral being $8,000-$10,000.. Etc etc and so on. To dump all this and more on my family would be horrible on top of the emotional pain they'd experience. This is the only thing keeping me from trying anything else "

"I'm just done.I just want to be done living. I can't take all the letdowns anymore. I'm drifting away from my friends, my best friend doesn't care about me, my grades are going downhill, my family is disfunctional. I'm gaining weight from just laying around and never doing anything. I hate myself. I'm ugly and socially awkward. I know deep down that no one cares about me except maybe five family members. And I think it's so unfair that people's lives are so much better than mine. My family is having a really rough time with money. And the one thing I truly hoped for, which was that the guy I practically love feels the same way, was taken away from me. I'm not even friends with him anymore. I think my mom is mentally abusive towards me.

I'm sorry thi is so scattered but I just have no where to turn. I hate living. I don't hate living, but I hate my life. I want to kill myself. If I had a gun, I would not hesitate to blow my brains out. The only thing that's stopping me is fear of the pain."

"What am I missing?I was about to write ""I hope I am missing something"" as the title, but that would be wrong, I am not 'hoping' per se, more like I'm checking one more time if I left the stove on before I leave.

There's nothing for me in here, I hold very little value for money, belongings, social status. And people are worthless to me because they value the aforementioned, are making themselves about those and from those. I am afraid that if I explain myself or my views fully, I'll infect someone else with this, but be warned: I'll elaborate and will tell my views if asked, they might seem not that bad at first or for a few years, but it's a seed that grows slowly. So don't be arrogant about it: it's nothing special, it's not a big secret and that's the twist.

Anyway.. There's just no point going on, there's nothing here for me that I can see. To me life seems to be just a waiting place for death, to keep yourself busy so death can surprise you. But how to keep yourself busy I nothing holds meaning to me? I can't get attached to things that disappear eventually, I am too emotional for that. My memories of the most beautiful, wonderful and magnificent people I have met are torturing me as it is. And I don't want any more pain. The most meaningful things hurt the most, and that's why I don't want them, because the pain is always the last thing of that deal. That's what I am left with. 

And if I continue regardless, it will eventually lead me to the same conclusion: the pain kills me. Life is so beautiful that it kills me. So why die in pain, when it is possible to die without it? If I don't take life to my heart, then there's no point continuing either, because I'm holding back; nothing is that important to me; it's meaningless.

So here's why I am writing this: is something I am missing, before I make the biggest decision I can ever make? An unchecked stove somewhere? If so, where should I look for it when I am somewhat aware of this:
&gt;A Sioux creation story says that long ago the Creator gathered all of Creation and said, ""I want to hide something from the humans until they are ready for it. It is the realization that they create their own reality.""

&gt;The eagle said, ""Give it to me, I will take it to the moon.""

&gt;The Creator said, ""No. One day they will go there and find it.""

&gt;The salmon said, ""I will bury it on the bottom of the ocean.""

&gt;""No. They will go there too.""

&gt;The buffalo said, ""I will bury it on the Great Plains.""

&gt;The Creator said, ""They will cut into the skin of the Earth and find it even there.""

&gt;Grandmother Mole, who lives in the breast of Mother Earth, and who has no physical eyes but sees with spiritual eyes, said, ""Put it inside of them.""

&gt;And the Creator said, ""It is done.""

Also this might be a **long** conversation or the shortest ever, with no reply. So if you are not up to ""the challenge"" help someone else, your words may be wasted on me. Speak from the heart and if nothing comes up, then continue on it's not your fight. Truth should be effortless. But don't be intimidated, your words can make a difference, who knows it can be as little as ""Dude, you forgot to drink your coffee"" and then it all dawns on me lol.. no promises though.. don't beat yourself up.. but anyway, I wanna go, so did leave something undone? Something worth checking out? Inb4 ur lyfe, AC movie, Rogue one movie, and the year 2017

Thanks in advance"

"conflicting values, suffering, etc etcwhen do you sacrifice your own values and or beliefs for some other good? and how do you even make this judgement considering that your values and beliefs can shift? and when you cant tell what good or lack of good will come from each decision?

i am left to make multiple decisions based on this, its utterly impossible.

the most pressing and relevant one for here is that of death. as it stands, i currently dont think any amount of good is worth even the smallest amount of suffering. therefore, life shouldnt exist. however, obviously, i cant just have the whole world die, and the vast vaat majority dont share this belief anyways. and im not even sure if i believe it, i cant tell.

because of this, i feel it is right to die. me living causes suffering elsewhere, lots that im not even aware of, just based upon how global society is built up, how, essentially, our global economic system functions. and of course there are other reasons, as youd expect from someone posting here, i think im a bad person for a multitude of reasons, and whatever good i have is outweighted by it. but really, thst is secondary and can be ignored in this case.

the problem is, since the entire world isnt joining me, my suicide itself would cause pain. the best i could do is make it look like an accident, still not too much better though. regardless, i cant tell if me just living is the better option or not. both options, commiting and not, seem wrong.

i do have this drive to die, perhaps from mental illness (if youd like to call it that), that has me even consider this, i guess since i dont feel bound to the idea that living us a good thing (from what i understand this isnt common). im not sure if i am ill or its the world, blinded by their own brains telling them life is good so they stay alive, instead of the truth, that life isnt.

essentially, i have no time to make a decision. i can push this back again a couple of months, like i recently did, which is a decision to stay, at least temporaraly. my grades in uni are about to tank if i dont get back to work, so i have to do something. just lost really. and being dead would absolve me of all of this. and this is not the only situation in which i have to make a choice of this kind, there is at least one more that involves conflicting values that i have to figure out, although its a bit less time-sensitive and less final as well."

"Just hit rockbottom from nowhere.Today my girlfriend (of only a little past two months) broke up with me. It was hard but you'd think something as short as that would be easy to deal with; however, it was the longest relationship I had managed to keep(pathetic I know). What's worse is I made the mistake of becoming a member of her friend group and now I can't even talk to them without feeling like I'm choking. I have almost no one to talk to since they were my only close friends and I've never felt so close to killing myself as I am now. I almost broke down today in the library when I thought I heard her voice... When I'm alone, I feel like there's a hole in my stomach, and the physical tension is almost unbearable at some times. I know others out there have it worse than I do, but I've never been in a darker place. I was once put into a psych ward for an attempt that I would've followed through with had my dad not been home. I'm currently a first year in college and have no one else. I can't even study for my coming midterm without breaking into tears and thinking about killing myself.
sorry for the rant."

"I'm not sure what this post is about butI'm a teen, and lord am I having a hard time with finding a will to live. I don't have really any close friends, maybe a couple, but I'm not their first choice. It sucks being the last choice in your friend group, which is why I don't talk to anyone outside of school anymore. I don't have any motivation to do anything academic wise. it's not that I'm dumb, I'm kinda smart, just nothing interests me and everything's done last minute. I'm ugly as hell, and I hate the fact that people have to look at me. I don't know what I have to live for, and I feel selfish for saying that. I don't have any mental or physical illness, and nothing traumatic has happened to me. I just don't want to live. I'm not gonna do anything anytime soon, at least I think, because I don't want to be that one girl who killed herself in school. I don't want any bullshit memorials or any pictures of me hung up. My parents are proud of me for the first time in my life, because I'm quiet and lock myself in my room. I don't want to end it while I'm still living with them. Also a new season of one my favorite shows is coming out this year, and as stupid as it sounds, I have that to hold on to. I'm trying to get better but once once I graduate, I'm not sure how long I'm gonna last. I don't even know if I'm exaggerating everything or what I'm really feeling, which is why I'm not talking to anyone, besides this post i guess. As I said, I don't really know why I'm posting this, I'm think just frustrated and needed to vent somewhere. Anyways, to whoever might be reading this, thank you."

"I tried but I guess it was already too late. I'm literally on the brink of ending my life.So the issues will never be resolved. I'll never be worth it and I'll never be worth anyone's time. And I've recently come to realize that I don't deserve a life any more. You might talk to me, comfort me, etc.. But in the end, no matter how much you can try, you won't like me for who I am.. You'll like me for everything that barely begins to explain the real me. I nearly cried in three different places.  Everybody thinks they are like me.. and they judge me as if I was like them.. but they are completely wrong.. I'm not like them and I have never been like them.. Nobody will ever fully understand me.. and nobody will realize that I'm always overwhelmed and I can hardly function in proper ways on my own.. and I don't want to hear any more that I should love myself first.. After I've been taught for two decades that other people are supposed to love me, but they show it by hurting me. And then they try to mess with my mind and try to convince me that I hurt them. And sometimes they are so good at it, that I believe them.. but I stop when I remember the cruel things that they did to me when I was a child.. But it probably won't matter soon what I think anyway.. I have a method now.. and even if I used it, I might think in that final moment.. I finally did it.. And I'll probably have epiphanies of ways that I could have changed it.. unfortunately, I may not have enough time to think of them and I wouldn't think of them unless I actually used the method anyway... Now I'm just waiting for someone or something to deliver the final blow... then everybody will be at peace and I'll never have to worry about the past and the facts... and I'll never have to worry about how i'll never be able to fix anything..."

"Gave Up Everything For One Girl Then She Fucked Me Over, Itâs The Worst Feeling Ever!She is the perfect one. We got on really well. We accepted each other. We could talk about anything. We could do anything. I thought she was the one for me.

I know her since a year. There were two other girls I talked to. One of them wanted to be my girlfriend. Guess what I threw them away for one girl. 

She doesnât want to talk to or see me anymore. At our last meeting I kissed her. She liked it, but the next day she said she didnât want it to happen and now she doesnât talk to me. Wonât pick up the phone or anything. I spent a lot of money on her and it wasnât that I expected anything back. I did it, because I love her. Turns out she doesnât love me back. 

That night was the best night. All I can do now is be sad and think about how foolish I was to throw away two girl friends for her. 

Iâm left alone. I was the kind person and now Iâm fucked over. I want to die so fuckinâ bad every day Iâm feeling crappy. Whenever I fall in love I always get fucked over. This is the fourth time. Iâm tired of this shit."

"Wondering if I should kill myself or I should run awayI've been wanting to kms ever since I heard I was moving to another high school no matter what I do. My parents tol me that I could stay at my school if my grades are good, but that was just a lie and they thought I would get over moving, but I didn't. I haven't moved yet but we've already bought the house and it's about an hour away from what I call home. The scary thing is that I've accepted it. I'm ok with killing myself except for the fact that I won't be able to experience what life has to offer for me. What I'm asking is: what can I do to run away from home and start a new life. I need like a full plan and everything cause I don't want to get caught running away, I wanna just do it. Pls reddit, if this question is answered, that's one life you've saved."

"Im running a D&amp;D campaign, if you want to join, see below and fill out the form :) (This is a repost from yesterday, as it got buried quite quickly) *North of the Spine of the World and West of the towering Reghed Glacier is a frigid expanse few dare to explore, let alone inhabit. This icy land of windswept tundra recently became locked in a frigid tundra without reprieve.*

Hello! Soon I will be running the 5th Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign âRime of the Frostmaidenâ, and my friend and I are looking for another 2 players, all aged 14 to 18. This campaign is relatively long, going from level 1 to level 12.

The sessions would be every other week on Sundays, and should start at around 7pm GMT and end at 10pm, though time and day might move at some point. The game itself will be over Roll20, but Discord will be used for voicechat. 

I'm Dan, and I am 16, and as a DM, Iâm relatively experienced with both D&amp;D and Roll20, having been DMing for more than a year, though Iâm not so great at voices so please excuse my terrible accents.

You can create a character in the Session 0 if you get chosen, though having an idea of the character you want to create before then would help. I will also go over information about the setting in that session and everything, but for now, you should know:

-	Itâs set in the Forgotten Realms, in an arctic tundra known as Icewind Dale
-	The sun never fully rises, so races affected by Sunlight Sensitivity, such as drow, will not have to suffer the negative effects of it.
-	Goliaths get resistance to cold damage due to their mountainous lifestyle
-	Only races, classes and spells from official D&amp;D books (excluding Unearthed Arcana and possibly some subclasses from Tashaâs Cauldron of Everything, depending on if they are balanced or not.
-	Expect to be running away or solving things âdiplomaticallyâ relatively often, instead of being able to just kill everything all the time; thereâs a lot of powerful creatures around. Overall, this game will be a bit more RP focused than combat focused.
-	Itâs reaaaaaally cold in Icewind Dale
-	Really, really cold

If you want to apply, fill out this form:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyUxfN4s_UMZQIeuOeiA378zQ62TeOh4ad2KV7quP_ETtUJg/viewform?usp=sf_link

The form will close in a week from now, and for anyone who looks like theyâd fit well in our party, there will be an opportunity to talk a bit before you join the Discord server.

Anyways, good luck, and I look forward to seeing your application :)"

My ""mum"" says I am worthless, ugly, and tries to bring my down by Saing my birth family never wanted me. She also tells me that I am like my adopive dad (her ex-husband) and my sister (who she hates becouse she went with my dad) Most people anyways on first glance will call me ugly. I was also have âfriendsâ that know I self-harm but think its just me trying to get attention. I was raped. No one really knows this but I was raped when I was nine by a bully in my adoptive dad's neighborhood. Within the next few days, I am going to end myself. Goodbye world. To the people who were my true friends, the ones that knew stuff and tried to stop me, I am sorry and I hope I did not mess up your life. I was a nobody anyways, Goodbye."

"Nothing works.One step forward just to take three steps back. I'm broke, drained, and demotivated. I thought my medication was working. For a week or more I was super motivated. Not happy, but not thinking about suicide. Yet a week later here I am again. Death seems so much easier than pushing forward. Im thinking about hanging myself this weekend."
"HelpI was depressed for a very long time before now but just recently I've been getting up at 6am to walk the dog I've been reading books and exercising and this has been going on for about week and it's been great but today everything came back and hit me like a truck I've been crying, hurting myself, breaking things and I dont know why and i just want it to stop

I think alot of it came because I dont have anyone I trust or am ok talking too about this stuff (hence posting this on reddit) but a few months ago I took myself to the top of a building and nearly killed myself and I'm scared I'll try again 

It's just every time I think about killing myself I realise that no one would really care if I did and it might even have a positive effect like it might cause a mental health day at my school which will prevent the suicide of someone people actually care about and the people I hang around with will be happier because they dont have to deal with me being miserable all the time

I dont know what I want to get out of posting this I guess writing this has helped calm me down a bit but I dont think I should kill myself but that will likely change if my depression continues and I dont know how to stop it

I'm probably going to go to sleep now and I'll look at comments if there are any in the morning. thanks for reading it writing it really helped calm me down"
"At first I was so terrified of getting the virus I took every precaution possible. Now life has gotten so unbearable for other reasons that I couldn't care less if I catch this thing and die.I was born with a fucked up heart. Survived a super rare virus as a baby that led to multiple blood transfusions and a lifetime of catching everything that came down the drain. I remember being the only one of my friends in high school to catch H1N1, and how I never felt physically worse. For two months I couldnt breathe, couldn't move, couldnt sleep and chugged tylenol sore throat straight from the bottle.   

  
So in January when I read what was happening in China my heart broke for all those affected. I couldnt stop worrying about it and everyone thought I was crazy. Now all these people who told me it was nothing to worry about are screaming ""stay the fuck home"" as if it were that easy. 

It wouldn't be so bad if I wasnt about to lose my kid too. He's autistic and got out the house a few weeks back. Now CPS is forcing home visits multiple times a week, berating me for fucking up like I don't already know how fucking stupid I am for taking out the trash at 9pm when I thought he was already asleep, only for him to slip out behind me.

I already had extra locks but now I have more, a deadbolt that you need a key to open both ways. 

I'm tired of being told I'm a bad mom. I'm tired of being told I'm not doing enough. I'm tired of having to watch my kid 24 fucking 7, stopping him from jumping on the sink and taking off his clothes and shitting on the carpet and flinging it all over the place. I'm fucking TIRED of hearing other parents complain about the absolute stupidest shit when my kid will never be able to take care of himself or tell me he loves me or understand danger. 

I have locks on the fridge. Locks on the pantry. Locks on the windows. My life is a fucking prison I want OUT 

CPS is coming tomorrow for another laugh at my expense. Another shot at pushing me off the edge. I wish them fucking luck because killing myself is the only end I see in sight and I'm over this labyrinth of suffering I'm ready to join my dead parents in the abyss of nothing waiting for me on the other side 


Throwaway cuz this is already humiliating as shit and I dont need another single fucking person telling me I deserve this"
i don't know what to put hereI'm not quite sure where to begin. I'm nearly 19 but I've been experiencing depressive episodes and suicidal thoughts since I was 10 and 11 respectively. It's just.. so hard to go on like this. I don't want to die but I don't want to be alive even more. 
You know what? I should have been the twin that died. Like Fr tho

"I donât crave death, I just want my problems to be over with.I decided a while ago that I was just going through the motions of living, but the main variable stopping my plan is that a store near me has been effected by the COVID/Unrest sparked gun shortage. I am also worried about what this will do to my boyfriend because I wouldnât want him to suffer.



My main issues are money, which is ultimately a foolish thing to end a life over. But reasonable, because I cannot accommodate my needs without extra help. I donât see the point in living if I canât have the ultimate quality of life; I donât need to own a mansion, but Iâd like to have the funds for necessary surgeries related to health and not just aesthetics. I also canât find a reason to go on if my intelligence is limited (I struggle with certain subjects and focusing to a large degree) as an adult student."
"Sick of this question mark exsistenceI hate that I have no real justified reason to feel the way I do and yet year after year I keep getting hounded by this nagging that my existence it pointless.

But even that doesn't have the same hold on me as it used to. I fear that it'll be like this always.
 I've tried before and I still have the rope tucked away in my room. There urge is back but at the same time I'm so scared of trying and failing to go through again. Currently there's a building in mind but yet I still desperately want to believe in a break from the cycle. "

"8 months of a chronic prostate infection has completely ruined my life and I don't want to do this anymoreEarly 2018 was the best few months of my life, I was confident, happy, doing great in university as a scholar, performing for various musical groups, and met my lovely lovely girlfriend. And then I got hit with a small prostate infection with no known cause. It used to go away with antibiotics, but after a few rounds of it returning it no longer seems to respond to antibiotics. Apparently my GP messed up big time by under-treating it which caused it to turn chronic.

The pain is actually completely bearable, the urinary urgency/frequency is very annoying but can be lived with. My libido is like 20% of what it used to be. But the main symptom I get from this inflammation is a constant barrage of flu-like symptoms (chills, body aches, occasional low-grade fevers) which completely wipe me out. On bad days I'm pretty much bed-ridden. Apparently this symptom is not even that common for people with prostatitis, but I have a body that reacts as such to a ""low-grade"" inflammation, and I hate that so much. It's like having a really bad cold for the past 6 months or so and all the joy has been sucked out from my life.

I had to withdraw from an exchange program to London (a dream opportunity of mine for which I had to fight many other candidates) and I took a leave of absence from university to try to get my health sorted out. The semester is now over and I probably looking at another half a year at home trying to figure this out.

We are still frequently finding bacteria in my urine but nothing seems to be able to get rid of it for some reason, and I've run through quite a number of doctors, all of whom eventually give up on my case and advice me to try to tough it out and resume living my life. Even if that were possible I'm really not sure I want to live out my life half-crippled like this.

For so many months I've been trying random drugs like a guinea pig, including anti-depressants in an attempt to suppress the nervous system to see if the symptoms can be managed, and so many long courses of antibiotics. I've got a PICC line to try to nuke the infection into orbit, but nothing's worked and I just grow sadder and weaker by the day.

I no longer have a social life or hobbies and the entirety of my life revolves around waiting for the next appointment and/or the next potential drug. My girlfriend comes over to visit me when she can and 80% of our dates are more like hospital visits these days. I can't help thinking that she'd eventually leave me. I've cried so much I feel completely numb at times (or maybe that's from the neuropathic pain stuff, I don't know)

So here I am, utterly crushed by a minor, low-grade infection causing ""mild"" but utterly debilitating cold-like symptoms that will never kill me. Sometimes I find myself wishing it would, instead of rendering me stuck in this hell.

I just came back from a new urologist for a second opinion and he literally refused to take my case, saying callously ""if you don't have a high fever, who cares? Just go and live your life""

I really don't know what to do now... Help"

"Something about childhood/adolescent abuse. I've been interested in the topic ""Serial killers"" for a while now. I've read many articles, and books. They all had one thing in common: A traumatic childhood.

Ed Gein, for example, was severely abused by his parents, and thus developed severe schizophrenia, which, among other things, led him to do horrible things. When I read his biography, he seemed like a decent, kind child. He could have grown up to be fine. To have a family. 

I could name many others now, but I think Ed is the best example for now. 

He did terrible things, but imagine him, laying in his crib, playing in the living room, doing homework, having hopes, and dreams. Just like you, who reads this.

I know this was long ago, but did things really change that much? Abuse will never die. Neither will murder.


It hurts me to think how many people suffer the same. With no help to get. The neglected people, some of them becoming school shooters, or other criminals. Because hate is a strong feeling you can hardly eradicate. 

So, please, if you know someone suffering from abuse, neglect, or anything like it, talk to him. Listen, to what he has to say. Prevent him from having further mental damages, or doing damages. You will never really get much credit, but know, that little things like listening to someones Problems can prevent so many pain"
"I'm going to kill myselfI'm a 20 year old girl with anxiety, depression and mild Aspergers. My teenage years have been difficult to say the least. Now I've just been diagnosed with Chron's disease and the beginning of arthritis. One of these is already bad enough but I feel as though I'm being tortured.

"My whole life, I've felt like shitI need help.

I think I pushed one of the best friends I could ever ask for away, by clinging too tightly to our relationship. It happens every time I make a friend. I have few left, and I think we're all lonely people.

Today's my birthday. And I feel so. Abandoned. I'm sitting here in a semi truck cab, my stepdad in the bunk asleep, me curled up in the passenger seat. I'm trying to get my life together. I'm going to be a truck driver. If I can make it through the end of the year.

My anxiety is controlling me though. I can't get through a day without feeling existential dread from the moment I wake up, if I sleep at all. It's been like this for years. It's getting to where I just don't want to live anymore. I just need to push through. But god damn it is hard as fuck. 

I wish I could just. Stop. I wish I could just stop and breathe and not feel this shit anymore. I'm fucking angry and tired of feeling this way. I want to scream. I want to disappear. I want to stand up and yell out loud at anybody who will listen about how much pain I am in. Every. Day.

"Should I just kill myself?Ok trying to make this as brief as possible:

Mental breakdown around January last year. Went from an extremely heavy and skinny smoker who only ate garbage to a gym rat. Eating, eating, eating, 4000 calories per day, becoming strong.

However: I get filled with regrets because the contrast is so huge. I feel like I'm about to die. Also get so fucking angry at myself and feel like the biggest failure ever. I mean... Who smokes!? Who neglects his health!? Only losers do that. Self-esteem below zero. Suicidal thoughts.

I contact my ex to talk about it. Look up to her because she's 8 years older. I start it off on the wrong foot with extremely negative texts and I feel like I have to explain myself. She constantly says something I want to reply to and then blocks me so I keep making new accounts. One time she says 'you didn't change a bit and only went backwards' so I make a new account one last time to reply with 'but I did change'... Then she explodes. Writes a message to hurt me as much as possible and says she will never reply again. Says shit like 'you'll never learn how to live your life'... Saying that to me in my situation is pure poison for my brain. It's black on white and becomes engrained in my brain.

Every single minute of the day it keeps repeating in my head. I'm so frustrated and sad that she said that to me because it completely ruins my mental health and makes me feel hopeless. I can't cope with it and constantly write messages and delete them again only to write them again everyday explaining myself and apologizing. She never replies. After like 4 months of doing that shit she gets rid of her instagram ð I wrote a last extremely personal e-mail to her work, but she left that company so it got forwarded to her co-workers. Holy shit. 

Conclusion: I've turned into a stalker. Should I kill myself? I can't live with the embarrassment and shame..."

I want to let go. I thought about telling a story about my life and how it's hopeless to keep going. but my story doesn't matter. what I want is to stomp out whatever spark keeps my fire going. I want to extinguish all doubts. What I want is to be gone. I have lots to drink and a rope, and tonight I'll fight again to defeat the treacherous bastard that is hope. I welcome any thoughts on this, preferably in pm form. wish me luck. (or don't). Here we go."

"I don't want my life anymore.Like I wish I could just transfer my years of life to someone who would do something with it instead of me. I've waisted my life. My ex used to scream in my face how I am nothing and I've done nothing with my life but I honestly was at least trying before him. He hurt me in so many ways and then just became a tinder patrolling fuck boy after we broke up. His birthday was this week and coupled with Valentine's Day I am really struggling with loneliness and depression. 
I want to go on his page and see all of our mutual friends who wished him happy birthday so I can delete them out of my life forever. If they don't want to believe he abused me I don't want them to be a part of my life. But I have been able to refrain from letting my pain act out in any way. I haven't had a steady job in years and barely get enough freelance to survive. It destroys my self esteem worse than he or my parents did, and that's saying a lot. I used to really be confident and like myself but now I just find everything and everyone so exhausting and overwhelming that I just wish I could die. I think about it a lot. I already tried to poison myself last year when he was telling me I was telling me I was disgusting and a whore and meeting up with outer girls and lying to me about it. I feel isolated after learning that he and my parents are narcissistic abusers and I have no one. "

"GuiltHi Reddit, a month ago I was watching a video on r/amateur... Two days ago I remebered it. I suddenly was in absolute Horror if the girl was underage or if it was rape. Today I searched it and IT IS NOT ORIGINAL CONTENT! It is not proven. I'm so disturbed. I think, I will tell my family and kill myself. Not today but very soon. I can't live with this uncertainty..."
"Thanks for a great first year! So a year ago today, I joined Reddit and I have absolutely no regrets. All of you guys have made it really special for me and I wanted to thank all of you guys for giving me such a great time! All your memes, discussions and this subreddit as whole has really cheered me up when I needed it. So yeah. Thanks to all of you guys!"
"its almost the 1 year anniversary and im thinking about doing it sooner. please help melast year, on march 14th 2015, my abuser left me.

they werent an abuser at the time (well, yes, they were). they were my favorite person. i loved them a lot.

and then i woke up that morning to a message from them on skype saying good bye, they need to leave me.

and they removed me as a contact.

im not gonna go into too much detail, but i almost did it that day. i cried nonstop, i couldnt do it. the only person i liked just fucking *left* me.

and *then* they became an abuser. i would want to talk to them. they would call me names. their partner would literally describe how they wanted to maim me, how they wanted to murder me in cold blood.

that happened over the spam of i'd say 5 months. i had nightmares.

i was 12 when this happened, and turned 13 while it was still going on.

i attempted to kill myself using children's liquid ibuprofen. i remember the taste of it, burning my throat.

nothing happened, though.

so much shit happened. i want to repress it so bad, but before i know it it's fresh in my mind and im having a panic attack.

i cried myself to sleep. i would cut. oh god, the cutting. i remember doing a total of 30 cuts when i got home from school one day.

i was incredibly unstable.

and then, earlier this year, i got called out on everything i did when i was 12. *12.*

a post one of my ex-friends made on tumblr said everything i did, every disgusting, creepy thing i did. it had screenshots provided by my abuser. my friend's boyfriend contributed to the post, saying stuff i did with my ex, stuff that i didnt want to be revealed. stuff that he was more than happy to do.

people reblogged it, saying ""oh my god this is disgusting"" and i wrote a suicide letter for the public, saying i would steal a bottle of robittusin and drink it that night.

i didnt do it.

but oh god, the memories. oh god, im so fucking scared that someone i love will leave me on march 14th of this year. its only one week away.

i want these memories repressed so bad.

im the abuser. im the fucking abuser. all the shit i did, all the fucking creepy-ass shit i did when i was 12 and unstable and shit.

i deserved it, didnt i? i wrote that fic. i drew all that art.

THEY DIDNT CARE I WAS 12. THEY DIDNT CARE THEY RUINED ME HE RUINED ME THEY ALL RUINED ME oh god im crying im crying im so scared im so fuckign scared please god if you exist just let march 14th be an average day please dont let him leave me like they did i dont desreve thus anymroe im trying so hard to survive

im home alone i could literally take one of my dad's belts and hang myself right this second and then everything would finally be over. it would finally be over everything they ever did to me would lead up to this moment and i know they wont be affected. theyll shrug. theyll go ""oh well. he deserved it"" and go on with his life.

im crying im so fucking scared i didnt desreve this but at the same time i did and i dont want this i dont want this.

please god help me

edit: i went throguh my tumblr archives from march 2015 to see if i could find anything from the 14th and i found THEIR FACE I wnant to Throw up i also found the posts of the exact time it got RUINED

"I fucking hate myselfI keep neglecting my school work because I keep convincing myself I'm going to kill myself so I don't have to bother anymore and then when I'm supposed to kill myself I don't end up doing it so now I'm NOT dead with 3x more work than I should have and that makes me want to die even more and it's like a cycle that never ends. It's especially great because I get punished because my grades are bad even though I'm trying my best which makes me more depressed cause apparently not even my best is enough. 

I wish I'd stop being a pussy and just kill myself. I wish I had a gun. I wish I had a fucking shotgun, no chance of survival. End my life immediately. All I've got is shitty pills and knives and I guess I'm too pussy to overdose so I'll try the knife instead and see if I don't pussy out."
"BedlamWhen someone uses the phrase ""it was bedlam in there"" it refers to a mental institution in england which has been around for hundreds of years where the patients were put on display as circus acts for money.

"Iâm in my first relationship! Hi, Iâm very happy but I donât really have anyone to share this info with as we have agreed to not make it public yet.  A few months ago I (16m) met a girl (15f) who I thought was really cute and nice, and so after a few weeks of casual interaction I asked her out.  Unfortunately she wasnât ready for a relationship as she had just broken up with her ex (who no one had met) about a month before and was still processing that.  Well today our friend group was messing about on our schools discord server and the prompt of crushes came up, to which she stated that there was one guy she liked but wouldnât tell anyone. We kept prodding and she kept giving insignificant hints. Well after everyone left for food she started dming me about it, eventually telling me her feelings. We talked a lot and agreed that keeping it private to those close to us would be best.  Idk what to do now but Iâm real happy!"

There's no real help for suicidal people if they have real life problems not mental illness.Do you agree?
Fuck these dumb old peopleHow come old people like my parents think they know what it's like for me who's 16 in this generation. They dont understand anything and they wanna act like they do. If I tell them anything they act like my problems dont fucking matter and I'm just complaining and they say they had it way harder. 
"TitleMy problem is, every time I feel ready to do it and imagine myself jumping off the bridge I shiver in terror and remind myself of the things I like doing. It's completely delusional but it's hard to overcome instincts, it's like I love myself too much to die. I have to find a way out. I can't escape the mazes of my mind but I need to work within them to die."
"I feel like this every nightI am tired from being a useless fuck.

I have no real problems in life, but I am still a worthless piece of shit that cannot do anything he is supposed to do. I do not love anyone, don't accept the affection of others nor do I even like myself.

I've been supposed to be doing some useless reports since 1 PM, but my incredibly stupid self found ways to not do shit all day long. It's not that they actually matter, but I find it bothering that I cannot do the simplest of tasks.

I barely get 2 hours of sleep on any given day, and all I enjoy in life is to drink or smoke marijuana but in this society I am stuck in, because there is no way to not be a part of it, everyone is an ignorant ass that believe they know how to run your life and everyone else's, simply because they grew up with some sheltered belief, and only know about that one belief.

There is no God and humans are naturally evil.

Give me a reason not to kill myself."

"I don't know what to dojust brief background. I'm 18 and a freshman in college. I've been dealing with social anxiety and depression for a while now. It was really bad in high school, but ever since starting college, it's gotten a lot better, and I feel like I've been making friends and I've gotten to know a lot of great people.

But even though things had been going well, I feel like they're getting worse again. The first month of school I was doing so much shit, going to parties, going to club meetings, meeting new people, etc. But that has kind of stopped recently. Which by itself is fine, since like I said, I might not be doing a ton of shit and meeting a lot of new people, but I've consolidated a nice, tight group of friends.

But even though things have been going well, there is still something I lack in life, a romantic relationship with someone. In high school I had no success whatsoever, for a variety of reasons, to the point that I was kind of resigned to the fact that I would probably live and die without being in a relationship with anyone. And as pathetic as it seems, I was really OK with that, especially since I had gotten so used to it. Over the summer before college, I was way more concerned with trying to make friends. And that's part of the reason that I was so happy the first month of school. Because that's what I got. I was meeting new people, becoming friends with people... for the first time in my life I felt like people didn't view me as someone awkward, as someone lesser. People actually wanted to be friends with me, probably in large part due to the fact that everyone was a freshman and desperate to meet new people.

But then for maybe the first time in my life, I started having feelings for other people. I guess part of the reason I never really had a crush on anyone in highschool was that I was never really good friends with many people, and for me, anyway, I feel like I need to know someone well before I start to feel anything for them. So anyway, there was this guy I met who I knew was bi, and I asked him if he wanted to do anything sometime, but he told me that he was still uncomfortable with his sexuality, so he didn't want to do anything. Alright. no problem with that. I was a little dissapointed I guess, but I got over it.

But then I met this girl in one of my classes. It was during one of the first days, so no one really knew anyone else, so I just sat next to her and started talking. I had literally no interest in her at that point, I was just trying to make friends. And it went pretty well, and we started talking more and more, and we did some stuff after class a few times (like study for tests, get lunch, that kind of stuff) and I started to really like her. So I asked her if she wanted to hang out a few times, but she was unable to because she was busy over the weekends, which kind of bummed me out, but then a few days ago after class we got lunch together, and she was talking about how much she liked art, and I invited her back to my dorm to show her some of my drawings.

And from there... I don't really want to get into specifics, but I kind of fucked up. And I feel like if I was more confident or had more experience at this kind of thing I could have had a chance with her. But I was just so awkward and inexperienced I didn't know really what to do. I think we're still amicable, but I definitely don't have any shot of getting with her in the future, I guess.

And this has really been fucking with me for the past few days. But it's not really about losing a chance with her. Because I like her and all, but that's at least something I can get over pretty quickly. It's the fact that I feel like I'll never find anyone. I feel like I'll always be too awkward and depressed to actually have any kind of relationship. I don't give a shit about sex or physical intimacy. I just want to feel like someone cares about me. Especially after being spat on and tossed aside all my life, I just want to feel NORMAL. And I feel like that will never happen. I feel like I'm missing out on such a huge part of life. People talk about relationships all the time and shit, and it makes me feel so excluded to know that I'll probably never have one. But more than that, I feel like I'll always have some lingering shred of anxiety and depression, and that I'll always be different from other people. 

I honestly don't know what to do. I don't want to feel this way. I just want to be normal. But I don't know how to improve myself. I desperately don't want to kill myself. But I can't keep going on like this. I can't keep going on being inherently inferior to everyone else. I feel like if things don't get better in the next few years I'll end up killing myself. But I really don't want to. I just don't know what to do... I just want someone who isn't my family to care about me deeply. But I feel like that'll never happen."

"So I really want to just do it already but my younger brother's birthday is in two days.Honestly he's the only one worth sticking around for. If it weren't for him I would have done it over ten years ago. He's only 17, about to be 18. His life is about to start and I don't want to fuck things up for him, but honestly idk what to do anymore. I'd feel awful if the anniversary of me doing it were so close to his birthday. We've grown distant over the years but I know it would hurt him. Ugh. I have no reason to stay other than him and my best friend, who I live with. I feel like everyone is pressuring me to get a job and I just want to take a small break first. I just graduated college, I worked the whole time I was there, I saved up, and now I want to take some time off for myself and everyone is getting on my case because I haven't found a job yet. Even my friend. I'm living off of my money. Didn't ask anyone for anything and I can pay my rent just fine for a while, so idk what people's problem is. I've let them know I want to take a break but I guess that's not acceptable. Why is it that nothing I do is good enough? I don't get it. I wouldn't care what they think except that they're all constantly pushing me, and it sucks. I want to tell everyone to just shut up and leave me the fuck alone and stop trying to make me feel so bad about myself for not having a job. My friend didn't work at all the past two years and she now has a job which is fine but it's hypocritical of her to judge me when she had class two days a week for a year and almost never went anyways and laid around all day. Idgaf it's her life but they hypocrisy is incredible. If I pointed this out I know she'd get upset. I could say ""hey you laid around in bed and did nothing for a year taking out loans your parents are going to pay off for you so don't fucking judge me"" but I know it would hurt her. She's really type A and I think she's just trying to help, but when I tell her I don't want her help it upsets her. It hurts her feelings, because she's upset that I'm annoyed with her since she's trying to do something nice for me. I've expressed I really appreciate the effort but I have things I need to figure out first. My mental health has always been shit as long as I can remember and it's been even worse than usual lately. I'm just so tired of people always pushing me. I don't want to be nice anymore. Sometimes I feel like if I wasn't extra nice then no one would want to be around me. I don't have any other good qualities. That's why I'm scared of being more upfront and assertive, because if I am then people will stop liking me. Idk what to do anymore."

"Does a suicidal person realize?Iâve been super depressed for about 2 months now. Iâve had years of depression before this too. I recently started telling my wife we are going to sell some things. Some of these things mean a lot to me. For instance, Iâve been a gun collector, I told her we should sell those, and my car. I didnât really think much about it then, but now, Iâve spent most evenings from home working on odd jobs, I feel like there is stuff to get done.

I am a retired veteran for medical reasons. 2 deployments that were hell. I have been through many suicide awareness classes so I am seeing these signs. I know I have suicidal thoughts, but I have never really made a plan. 

So my question is, are these subconscious thoughts? Am I unknowingly planning my demise?"

"very depressed without my dogour dog of 11 yrs got put to sleep yesterday. I've dealt with terrible depression since 2013.. in 2013, my mom died from an overdose. I was also getting bullied and outcasted in school. during those lonely years, I got close to my dog and he was the only one who really kept me together. he would lay in my room all day and all night and he would wait for me to come home from work. when I would get home from work, he would get so damn happy; now that he's gone, my life is so empty and lonely. everything is so empty and lonely now. I don't know how to explain it. I would look forward to seeing him everyday and now there's nothing. I don't feel unconditionally loved or protected anymore. I'm just empty. I've been sleeping a lot due to the fact that I don't really want to be alive anymore. I'm very alone without my dog. I'm not  going to act on any of my thoughts, but I don't want to live anymore. I just want to sleep."
"So I want to die......I've had enough of life.

Suicidal ideation is not new to me. But recently it's become much more real. Bit by bit, I'm destroying everything good in my life. Recently I admitted myself to hospital due to a large overdose of painkillers. It was a stupid thing to do. Overdosing on those things isn't likely to kill me.

I'm in a rational, clear-thinking frame of mind right now. I know there are other ways, and that things can get better. But really I don't care. It's not that suicide is my only option...it's the option I *want* to take.

I don't even know why I'm posting here.

Meh, I'm going to try sleep, see how I feel in the morning."

"Need adviceHello everyone

I came to talk about my case here which I consider a great place to get good advice for my problem. After all, you know a lot about the internet

I have a friend, a best friend, or... I had. He is one of those friends that we tell everything without fear, he knows my secrets and I know his secrets. Our friendship is for 7 years. But I didn't know who he really was. One day, I saw a post of him going viral where he used my photo as a ""meme"" in his ""shitposting"" group ... well, I then discovered that he used me to generate jokes and content for the group he participates in. It is a group where people humiliate and make fun of others on the internet. It is a large group of incels and people with hatred.

I do not know what else to do. I am taking sleeping pills and I am very afraid of having my reputation destroyed, losing my job and being ashamed before my family. He has since blocked me on social media and I no longer have contact with him.

I need to study and work, but I can't do anything else. It destroyed me and I fear for the future, as well as being very disappointed."
"I'm tired of people telling me how much potential I have that I don't use.As a child I was said to be ""gifted"". I could read and speak two different languages before I hit first grade. 

In my first couple of years I excelled and had the best grades in class without effort. I was always distracted and lazy though. I could never really 'focus' on my work and often rushed it off. I was also active as I participated in cricket and athletics. 

Long story short, I had good friends but was bullied a lot. This started to affect me negatively in fifth grade when the bullying became so bad that I absolutely hated going to school. My grades dropped and I was miserable. Eventually my parents found out about it and I switched schools. I was diagnosed with depression at age 10 and put on anti-depressants. 7 years later I still haven't recovered and I'm back on anti-depressants. The bullying incident lead me to become anti-social and distrustful. I never formed any friendships in High School and my grades are very poor. I hate my current high school so much that I've considered running away. I'm an outsider. I feel like I don't belong here, and my parents are pressuring me to perform but I'm constantly distracted and I can't focus on schoolwork. 

I feel as if everyone is pitying me. I'm a useless teen with no ambition or motivation and I just want to get out of this lonely existence but I'm too much of a coward to end it.

I intentionally skipped the details, it's hard to make people what I feel. I'm full of loathing for myself and jealousy for normal people who don't have to go through this.

Someone with experience, please tell me it will get better because I don't think I can stand this for another second. "
"How I became a rap fan. (Not that anyone cares) 3 weeks ago I was watching a Viantastic(Splatoon YTber) video, and stumbled upon his incredibly short-lived rap career. He had some decent songs, but I saw someone in the comments compare him to Eminem. I had no idea if it was true, so I listened to a few of his songs, and realized that his songs were amazing. Around this time, Wadsm(another Splatoon YTber) released a highlights montage, with âx gon give it to yaâ as the background song. I could barely hear it over the in-game audio and the added memes, so I looked up the original song and enjoyed it quite a lot. YouTube then decides to recommend me a bunch of hardcore rap songs to me, and I unironically enjoyed all of it. I decided to keep going with it and now, I, a white, nerdy, legally gifted, 14yr old boy, am a rap fan."
"I feel numbI'm the person people go to if no one else is available, and I can't blame them. All I do lately is complain about my problems because they keep getting worse and it's gotten to the point where I can't enjoy life anymore. I feel like I'm letting everyone down all the time. I hate what I've become. I used to be witty, clever, and fun, but now I'm just a black hole that absorbs other peoples energy. It feels like I've lost the ability to feel true happiness. I feel like my life ended when my childhood ended. Everything I did after childhood were just failed attempts at feeling good again.

  


Lately, I just lie in bed and stare at the ceiling every night, until a thought comes across that hits a sensitive spot. Then, I have an emotional breakdown and lose control for a moment. I get the urge to physically punish myself. Sometimes, I take a sharp knife and blindly cut around on my leg. Sometimes, I grab a bottle of trichloroethylene and inhale that until I pass out, although it has nearly killed me once in the past. After a while, the emotions pass on, and I go back to feeling empty and doing nothing, until the cycle repeats. I've lost interest in all the things I liked to do. Nothing brings me joy anymore. The only times I still feel good is after a ridiculous amount of caffeine or a joint, but the feeling passes quickly, and then I go back to feeling like shit.

  


I think about suicide at least a couple of times a day, but I can't kill myself cause there are people who actually care about me. I sometimes lose control over my actions though, so I'm scared I might actually try again. I've attempted suicide 7 times throughout my late teens while I was heavily struggling with drugs, but luckily I never succeeded. I haven't had a proper diagnose yet, but I have all the symptoms of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and avoidant personality disorder. The bipolar symptoms have been present all my life. The others slowly developed over time. I have a first appointment with a psychiatrist this week. I doubt that talking alone will help much though. I'm hoping that medication will help me feel better. I probably should change some things in my life, but I can't do that as long as I feel the way I do now."

"I want to commit suicide.I have attempted many overdoses. thought many times about leaving the house to go jump off a bridge. I hate my life. My girlfriend just told me she's not allowed to date me anymore because of her dad and that just brought back the suicidal thoughts. I started taking venlafaxine not too long ago for major depressive disorder, and so far it hasn't done jack shit. I really am tired of life and everything going opposite of the way I wanted it to go. I just want to end it all, but I'm afraid of hurting anyone else as a result."

"How do you cope being a dropoutIts been almost 2 years since I dropped out of highschool because of mental health. I can't really reach out to anyone irl because they always dismiss how I feel. I try to distract myself but the suicidal thoughts are always there at the end of the day. Now that I'm nearing 18 next month, everything feels so heavy and hopeless. I feel like I'm burdening everyone just for existing.

"so, this is adulthood ...i am 20 years old, still live with my parents, have a job but cannot afford to move out yet and i am a university student also (so i do not have the time for full-time employment and i study locally, so i do not see the need for accommodation) and have a best friend and a few other friends. i am very lucky to have all of these things in my life.

however, since leaving school; i am struggling to process more and more emotions of mine now and understand them. i was bullied all through school by mainly students and sometimes staff, i have had people betray my trust several or times, and i have lost several close family within months to years apart between each death, and now having the time to process it is making me very numb or sad and i very rarely feel genuinely happy.

i am very reserved if not in shy in-person depending on the mood i am in and the company and introverted at the happiest of times, but i feel so disconnected from the few people i love and care about.

suicidal thoughts plague my dreams and thoughts on the daily and chronically daydream on the daily and go to ""my happy place"" and know if i were to die tomorrow or soon; i would not care in the slightest.

i also want to stop drinking alcohol and caffeinated drinks for good too, i do not think they are helping my mental state; i live for the few i love and care for. i just want a reason to live for myself but i cannot think of anything and i am gradually losing interest in everything i enjoy. i even have erratic mood swings, i will be quiet then next hyper, and then low and or suicidal.

whoever takes the patience to read this and give any advice, many thanks; i hope you are okay and you are getting any help if you need it."

"I wonât kill myselfBut I wish I were dead. 

I have had issues with passive suicidality since childhood but 2020 has nailed the lid in that coffin. The world would be better off without me and I would be better off not in this world. It is that simple. 

I donât ask for much of the world but I havenât touched another human being in 11 months. Thereâs a kind of madness in that. My region is extending lockdown and itâs not like I have any kind of relationship so who knows how long it will be. I canât live like this. I donât need movie theaters and packed restaurants but I need to be touched. And I havenât been and wonât be. 

I woke up in the middle of the night with the weight of a boulder on my chest. And thereâs nothing to relieve it. I tried calling the suicide hotline and they hung up on me because I donât âhave a plan.â

At the beginning of the pandemic I put an end of life plan into my medical paperwork and specifically added a DNR. I wish it was easy to just walk out into the wilderness and slowly freeze to death. I donât want to keep going like this until I am a wizened old man, alone and isolated and no one to even care to find my body. Not that anyone would care now."

"Give me a reason.  If i'm being completely honest, the only reason i'm here is because it's alot easier to unload my thoughts and feelings to a faceless mass of people than my friends and families. I'm not even completely sure if this is where I should be. I want to die, but perhaps a better way to put it would be, I wish I wasn't me. 

What pushed me to post here was a conversation I had with my mother. She said, in no uncertain terms, that because my grades in school weren't top of the class or as good as my peers, I was worthless, useless, and pointless. She continued to elaborate, at lengths, about how I did nothing in high school, i'm worthless in college, i've never made her happy in all my life, and how I was a complete and utter waste of time. I asked her one question. I asked her, aren't I more than a couple of numbers and letters? She said no. 

I don't disagree with her. Well, most of me doesn't. My friends are all going to fancy colleges, have straight A's, and are amazing, bright, intelligent people. And, that's not exaggeration or hyperbole. That's the honest to god truth. One friend got a full-ride to college. Another is in an exclusive 16-person only physics group. 2 more got decent scholarships to berkeley. And they all have somewhere between 4.00 and 5.00 gpa's. I'm not even sure how we're friends. They all have shining futures and brilliant lives to live. I'm nothing like them. 

I talked some of those same people out of some pretty deep points in their lives. I've talked one of them out of suicide. I helped them on the tracks that their on in my own, minuscule ways. But I could only do that because I knew what they had ahead of them. I knew they were all people worth pushing towards life. They were worthwhile people, with worthwhile reasons to live. I'm not.

To address the title, i'm asking if someone, anyone can give me a reason not to disappear. Not to walk away from everything and die quietly, where I won't make waves. I'm not a person worth saving, and I have little purpose left, so give me a reason. I'll answer any questions anyone might have as honestly as I can for the next hour or so. And then I'm gone, like breath on the wind."

"I forced myself to live for a very long time. Itâs time to go. Soon.Wallowing in self-pity made everyone turn their back on me which I understand. I donât see any other way out.

Iâm here because itâs such a heavy topic to talk about and the stigma around it is still present in the society I am. Iâm really worried and feel sorry for my family that wanted the best for me ... from a distance.

âThe Y familyâs youngest died from suicide.â Personally I donât know anybody that died from suicide.
Only 1 internet acquaintance â although we only had a few (cherished and positively memorable) interactions, I cried when I heard the news.

I have a history of panic disorders &amp; trauma and will permanently take time off ... elsewhere.
I wanted to be remembered as a bright, fun-loving person but now Iâm a psycho.
People stopped giving me attention because itâs draining to be around me. Iâm better off dead and silent.

When I typed emails to a person I looked up to and hurt unintentionally after they hurt me, I looked up a wikihow site. wha..... i lament about many things in general and have a lot of pent up self-hatred.
I still donât understand how to love and forgive myself. How do people do that? I feel stupid and worthless. No contribution to society, no addition that enriches another personâs life significantly. I am nothing.

"I don't want to die, but I'm afraid I might.First off, let me say that there are two ways I could die.
1. I could consensually commit suicide
2. Or I could accidentally harm myself to death during a panic attack

I've grown up having a hard life. This isn't a throwaway but I'm not gonna give too many specifics. My mom was on drugs almost my whole childhood, which led to her leaving when I was in 4th grade. She came back and got sober years later and I now live wit her but thts later. I was picked on in school and the first time I ever tried to kill myself was in 5th grade. I went thru a cutting stage, tried to hang myself and my weight broke what the rope was tied to, tried to s lice my wrist open when a girl told me to when I told her I wanted to die, and did a pretty damn good job but somehow didn't cut the arteries, I sliced as hard as I could across the street so maybe thts why. Anyways my dad was abusive , stepmom too. I was sent to an all boys wilderness program for 15 months at age 16 because my stepmom wanted me gone. I've just struggled with this for a long time and it's really miraculous I'm still alive. Anyways I have just recently started to come to terms with the fact that I don't want to die because my panic attacks have been occurring more frequently and with more strenght(I have bad panic, anxiety, and extreme depressive disorders) I take clonazapam, but it doesn't seem to work. I've struggled with opiate addiction on and off for about 2.5 years. I relapsed a few weeks ago on my good friends 1 year anniversary of his death, and I've detoxed myself and relapsed every 5 days then started over 4 times Since then and currently am on a two day relapse after five days of mild withdrawal. I'm gonna start over again tomorrow, and plan on following through and staying clean. I'm tired so I'm rambling but I saw tht helmet post on the front page and it's put me in a kindof suicidal state. I just can't stop thinking about it, and I can feel the panic creeping on. It's not withdrawals, so its just my depression. I guess I'm just afraid because of the panic and I'm rly hurting inside from a lot of personal things. I just hate life. A lot. I'm almost misanthropic sometimes, and sometimes i believe in world peace. I'm also afraid I'm going to Lose my mind completely someday, and hope I die if I do. I don't know, I guess I just needed to vent and can't tell a doc cuz I'm not going back to the hospital. Made that mistake once.
Tl/dr I'm chronically depressed and I am lonely and kindof feel like suicide would be an option right now."
"How to create a life thatâs bearable???Weâve all head the common trope âpeople want to commit suicide because they want to end their PAIN, not their LIVESâ. 

Okay well yeah maybe.... but thereâs no good way to live for someone like me. Holding a job feels impossible because my âbad daysâ are unpredictable and I canât be calling off work every time I have panic or Iâm too depressed to move. 

Iâve been suicidally depressed for 10 years. Meds donât help, therapy doesnât help, hospitals donât help. This is who I am. IF I could create a simple and comfortable life by living off disability, I would DO IT. But the sad truth is that disability isnât enough to live off of. Iâd lose my car, my credit would go to shit, Iâd never be independent again. 

The sad truth is that money is freedom in our society. Iâm not well enough to make money. So it feels sort of like natural selection. I canât burden others with taking care of me. 

Suicidal is quite literally the only option. I genuinely REGRET not going through with it when I had morphine available. The only thing the past few years have brought me is more pain and suffering.

Iâm smart enough to know that the older I get, the worse it will get. I just canât wait for a good opportunity to end it all. I wasnât cut out for this world and Iâve accepted it. Itâs sad that if it were possible, Iâd give life a chance. But itâs not possible. Not for someone like me. 

Recovery wonât ever happen, and misery is certain should I embrace poverty. I guess this is just me realizing there really isnât a better way."

"Planning on finally killing myself this week I'm so tired of this shit. Every month and year my life seems to be getting worse and worse and I can't take it anymore. I've been abused mentally and psychically as a kid by my family and when I thought when I turned 18 and went to college I would finally be free, so there was no need to kill myself. When I turned 18 I wasn't allowed to do anything because my family was manipulate as hell and infantilized me. My mom still cut up my food for me until I turned 12. My family would treat me like I was an idiot and everytime I wanted to make my own decisions they would say no. I wasn't allowed to drive, so I don't have my license. My mom would obsessively call me everyday while I was away at my dorm and would keep me on the phone for a minimum of 2 hours everyday. ""WHy DiDnT U jUsT teLL HeR to StOp?!"" Because I wasn't able to successfully get a job in college and she had to pay for all of my finances. If I told her to stop calling me less she would start getting an attitude and guilt tripping me. 

 I ended up flunking out of college because one of my roommates the first semester I was in college kept picking on me and we eventually got into a physical fight in the middle of the hall because she punched me in the face. A few weeks after that happened my mom kept telling me to get over it while my old roommate was tweeting that she wanted to kill me and obessesively thinking about what I was doing all day. With that and having to deal with my mother calling me for 2 hours everyday I was just tired and I became extremely suicidal. 

I told my mom I ended up flunking and she started crying. She wasn't crying because of anything I was going through she was crying because it made HER look bad. My mom's boyfriend started getting an attitude as well and one day he screamed at the top of his lungs because I didn't know how to do a math problem. He was like, ""YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO DO THAT?!WOW!"" They treated me like absolute shit. 

Years of that continued until I got fed up and one of my ""friends"" helped me to get out of there and across the country to another state. My friend helped me pay to have a roof over my head for a 3 months which I really appreciated, but then she started getting an attitude and flaking on me. I'm not even clingy. I wasn't complaining about what was going on everyday, I gave her space. 

I got a job at amazon and I've been working here for 5 months and I got pulled to the side by two managers and told that my TOT was an hour and a half and they were implying that I must have been not doing shit. I think I accidentally was logged into someone else's account, but when I kept telling them I was working they were just staring at me like I was crazy and told me that they were going to have to send it to HR and HR will ""check the cameras"", and get back to me. To me that means your going to be fired. After that one of the managers tried to give me an assignment after basically telling me I was going to be fired and act shocked when I broke down and walked off. I was screaming and crying outside because this is my only job and people were just staring and looking the other way like I was garbage. When I went back inside to finish my shift both of the managers were pretending like they didn't see me when I was right in front of them. I'm so digusted. Their still doing it today because they don't give a fuck about what happens to me. When I went to the Amazon subreddit and said this I was meet with downvotes and people telling me to talk to HR and tell HR to check the cameras. These motherfuckers don't give a fuck about me. Their only their to protect themselves and the company. This was my only job and honestly I'm so tired of having to pay to stay alive and be around a bunch of people who could care less if I was dead or homeless.

  It's so fucking heartless. People just have absolutely no empathy for other people unless it's someone close to them. I'm quiet and I don't kiss anyone's ass at work, so I'm fucked. The only ones that become managers are the ones that constantly kiss ass and have no empathy for other people. 

I'm just tired, so fucking tired and I know it's not going to get any better so I'm going to end my own life. At least I'll finally have peace and not be under constant stress 24/7."

"[M18] Finally deciding to get my writing out there. I made a website and am unbelievably proud of myself right now! I've been writing all sorts of things for the past year or so and kind of just letting it let me heal and think deeper about certain things. It's done so much good for me mentally to get things out, I cannot even describe it.

I lost my grandpa, who lived with me, in December and writing (I was working on a pretty long piece already about \[something indescribable. Life, maybe?\] and I ended up incorporating my grief and emotions and processing his loss through the piece), writing helped a lot. Especially writing about memories that I can go back and read and remember him like he's still here...

That piece isn't posted anywhere yet. I'm still going over it and adding and editing and processing.. One day, probably soon, I'll release it. 

But that's just kind of a background to what this post is about. I made a writing website where I've posted most of my other pieces (and am always adding more, and eventually adding the one I mentioned above)! 

I used to be really into coding and put it down entirely a few months ago. I was making video games, not websites, so the fact that I made an entire website from the ground up makes me really, really proud!! It's nothing special, but I like it. And if any of you guys like reading or art, you'd maybe like what's on it.

I've described most of my writings as essays about ambiguous topics that would be inappropriate to write in the standard five-paragraph essay format, and are way more properly represented through fiction/storytelling. That's just some. Others I describe more like paintings (I cannot paint or draw for the life of me, so I use writing to 'paint'). I hope that makes sense. Don't worry if it doesn't.

Anyway, I've rambled too much. I'd love talking to literally anyone, feel free to message me or comment or anything you want. I appreciate it.

Thanks for reading my post &lt;3 here's the site:

"I almost did it.There is a bridge, when I come back from my therapist's office, 400ft tall, Every time I go past it I think about jumping off. I really wanted to today, Yesterday, 6 of my turtles escaped, they are the only thing I live for, they are my whole world. Half of my world, gone. (I have 10 turtles)  I cried for an hour straight. Then, 2 hours after, I got into a fight with a family member. I did terrible things. This isn't new, I cause them so much pain, emotionally. I wish I were dead, just so I could end the pain I cause them. Losing my turtles almost pushed me off the edge. I looked for my blades, I couldn't find them though. An online friend made me promise her I wouldn't kill myself. Today, on the way back, I went on the bridge, I thought very seriously about jumping off, but I didn't, something held me back, I don't know what it was. I have autism, depression, anxiety, social anxiety, no IRL friends, lonely, anger issues, and more. I am a failure and disappointment to everyone. Yeah, I have a hard life."

"Piece of shit.I've done some really bad things in my life to myself and others. Really bad. So many awful sins. Lied about it. Looking back I'm so ashamed of myself.

No drugs or alcohol, but a life wasted on sexual impulses and no self esteem. I'm a grandma now, how do you live this shit down? some legacy.

"29 and doneI'm almost 30 years old and have struggled with bipolar for more than half of that amount of time. Nothing is working. I gave up the 'greys' of being on meds last year when I realized that they weren't doing their job. I simply cannot cope with life. My father commit suicide when I was a teenager. Several of my friends have. One friend did it last year and she used a method that I am sure I am going to use. I have a turbulent relationship with someone who is just as bad off as I am mentally. I have a child. I am not self sufficient. I have extreme self esteem issues and self image problems. I am almost constantly sick. I've tried twice to kill myself in the past and have been in a mental ward the same amount of times. I just cannot do this anymore. I feel like I am not meant for this place. I am a waste, a drain on society and its resources. The only salvation I ever had was my art and I have lost all drive for that as well. The only reason I've yet to off myself is that I want to do it when I am home alone, which is not often."
A note to myself. Happy birthday to me. I wish this year brings joy and meaning to my life. I hope I don't end my life. I hope I get all the best here. I wish i could go abroad to study (to escape my abusive family). I wish I could get a girlfriend (I'm gay). Let this year be the year I achieve my small goals. I will start loving myself. I will never self harm again. Have a great day. &lt;3

"I can't stop my mind from racing.Deep down inside, I don't really want to kill myself. I just want to be happy, to have friends, and to be able to experience the world like a normal person. 

Every day, I wake up to the same old shit. I force myself out of bed, groggy as hell, never feeling well rested, and immediately I begin to think of all the reasons I hate myself. The fact that I'm a college dropout of the engineering school I worked my entire life to be admitted to. Knowing how much I've disappointed my family and friends. What a waste of resources my life has been. How much better my parents lives would have been had I never been born. How my uncle and employer, once my biggest role model, must perceive me now, a complete failure. Realizing he'll never take me seriously, considering he thinks my depression is just a tactic I use to unconsciously manipulate my family. 

And then the suicidal ideation sets in. I was OK for a couple months, but lately it has been getting really bad again. Every day I commute to work, I fantasize about laying myself down on the tracks. I wonder, which suicide technique would have the highest probability of success and cause the least mess for others. Maybe I'm just inherently a bad person and unlikeable, maybe my suicide really is the better option for society at large. I would be doing the world a favor by removing myself from it.

Probably the only reason I don't kill myself is my mom. She is paying for my therapy, which I began two weeks ago. I am going to keep going, but I see it as a waste of money because I should have been able to make myself feel better already. I read three books in December, two about depression and one about social anxiety. I felt really good for about a month but I'm slipping again. Yet another failure.

I am constantly haunted by memories of past self-harm, torrents of thoughts of what a bad person I am, memories of myself hurting my close friends and ex-girlfriend emotionally, all because I hate myself so much and I can't get my shit together. Every day, memories pop into my head of my dad's abuse and I think maybe he was the only person who knew me for what I really was: a piece of shit. I think, the only reason I haven't gotten over what he did is because I am weak, and his emotional abuse really pales in comparison with what a lot of others go through. Still, I've been suicidal and self-harming since elementary school, so maybe it's not all my fault.

When it comes down to it, I really hate myself. I hate that I dropped out of school, I lost my girlfriend and now I'm losing all my friends one by one. I am beginning to feel really lonely and I'm tired of living like a hermit. I make an effort to see the only 2 friends I have left, but it seems like I'm putting forth all the effort with them. Most days I go to work, come home, smoke pot and entertain myself on reddit. I don't eat breakfast and I eat almost every other meal alone. I've been thinking about quitting smoking but I think my problems run deeper than that, and I'm worried I'd have even less contact with the only friends I have left. 

**TL;DR** + some other important info: I have hated myself for many years, I've never adjusted well socially and I'm losing my friends one by one. I've been working at my uncle's business since I dropped out of school, and while it has been a great opportunity for me, I have no way to meet kids my age. My uncle/boss constantly makes me feel inferior. He works 22 hour days and hardly ever sleeps. Once he encouraged me to take ephedra instead of weed (the ""right drugs"") so I could be more productive. He has made millions of dollars for a large bank, managing their online mortgage division in the pre-crisis days. I feel I will never be as ""good"" or as ""successful"" as him, even though my family was expecting me to, and as long as I'm not, I will be a disappointment to them. I was abused and neglected by my father but I have a hard time believing it really qualifies as ""abuse."" I am going to therapy but I see it as a huge failure because it wastes my mom's limited money and resources. I broke up with my first love last year, and it still hurts like hell. "

"I'm getting closer and closer to a suicide attempt, this would be my second...On 30/09/16 I tried to kill myself. I took several antidepressants (details in the link below), and whilst they made me very ill they did not finish me off. For the 9 or so months that followed that failed suicide attempt I was genuinely happy that I'd failed. However the last 2 months have been extremely difficult and I'm creeping ever closer to convincing myself to try again. 

In the last year I've lost my psychologist, she moved to Canada. I've lost my best friend, she's strangely decided that I'm the source of all her problems and is seemingly picking fights with me for fun. I was abused as a child, sexually, and my abuser is about to have his first child. I don't have much in the way of support, the NHS are aware of my situation but aren't particularly fond of providing me with any help. 

Long story short life was so bad this time last year that I decided to have a good go at topping myself, 11 months on life is considerably worse and I'm wondering if giving up on giving up was the right call. 

I'm writing this because... I have no idea. Drama. Attention. Pity. Help maybe. I hate myself and I really want to kick this breathing habit, so I'm not expecting anyone to turn my life around. 

Ps... I did an AMA 9 days after my attempt, feel free to have a read, it mate provide more context than I'm doing now.

"I want to die but cant kill myself because i made a promise that i wouldntI hate my life so much. I'm never happy, when I smile I'm taking it, I'm socially awkward which means women hate me which in turn means I'm forever alone. I have no job anymore and can't find another which means I'm broke. My family, friends and basically everybody who meets me hates my guts and I have nothing to live for. I don't ever break a promise that I make but I'm not sure I can keep this promise, life is just so hard and painful and I'm tired of trying so hard to make things right only and hearing people tell me that things will get better when they know and I know that it never will. I just want to end things and sleep forever. Everybody will be better off with me in the ground."

"How do I kill myself?Honestly so much in my life could be fixed if I just completed my online assignments on time or took notes or worked out or had the dedication to do something I want to do. I canât move forward in life like this and being alive isnât helping . My family is not very supportive either and school has no consideration for any of this. I donât want to keep suffering . Iâm not capable of making it through 12th grade and even if I somehow passed 12th I wouldnât be able to get a job respectable for my parents. I donât want to hurt my parentsâ esteem by being the failure I am but I cannot do anything. I lie to them about completing my assignments and notes because I donât want them to yell at me or be angry , my dad has high blood pressure and he works very hard but Iâm not getting anything done. Soon the school will ask me to upload my work and I will have nothing to upload. I have no other option."

"Mind, of destructive taste.Into the flood again, same old trip it was back then. So I made a big mistake, try to see it once my way.

I feel so lost in the dark. I can't deal with the withdrawals. I just spent the last few hours  sweating,  in extreme nausea, every single bone in my body aching, my pupils dilated, constantly agitated and not being able to sleep. The painkillers wear off eventually, and I dread that moment. 
I'm drugged out of my mind every single day. It's the only thing I can do to help me get through work and school. 

I'm back to square one. Nothing makes me happy, sad, annoyed, angry, or anything anymore. Food is tasteless, love is foreign, nothing interests me anymore. I just want to feel something. Anything. Anything other than the constant  craving for another hit. 

I'll never know how far to go, to reach the place. Am I wrong?

"Not because I'm sadI don't know if I'm in the right place, but I've been looking for just an outsider's opinion I guess. I have turned to a friend and was met with what can only be described as the most stupid response to a suicidal person: ""If you killed yourself by dildo, you'd be a legend.""

I want to plan the way I die. I'm not sad right now, and I'm not saying this'll happen tomorrow, this week, or this month. I just feel so sure one day I'll take my life. I don't want it to be the only choice, but my choice. While the goings good and the tide is high, I want to leave the party early for once.

Living isn't something I enjoy in general. I've had such a great life: I've seen 30 countries, met truly wonderful people. I can truly say my time here has been okay. And that's how I want it to be. The falling apart is impending, the great is at an impasse. The good will always exist if you look for it.

But my suicidal tendencies are going to catch up with me. Depression has loomed overhead for so long it's become a constant fixture. So instead, I'd like to meet them halfway.

If I give up my trip to Thailand, I can start the proceedings. 20 pills; 2 liters of alcohol. I do realize I'm romanticizing it all, but that's what I want of it: romance. Beauty in the terror cycle. I'm not rushing into anything in hysterics; rather I want to float into it and be enveloped by the law of the universe.

Do I make sense?
Has anyone else felt this specific way?

I apologize if I've inconvenienced anyone or if this was the wrong place to put this. "

I feel like i have no control of my thoughts my brain just does whatever the fuck it wants and it wants to fucking hurt me. I keep thinking of these fears and anxieties that are so bad that I actually believe they are real when they are not. I keep grounding myself and i still cannot fucking realize that its just my head getting to me but i still CANNOT FUCKING UNDERSTAND. Then comes the intrusive thoughts that stay in my head for the rest of eternity and never go away. The only reason why i cut is because of this shit, i cant fucking get away from it and its making me go insane.

"I'm not suicidal but I want to dieBefore I begin, I'd like to say that I really hope that I'm posting to the right place. I'm so confused as to what to call my condition. I don't put myself in dangerous situations intentionally or attempt suicide. I've thought about it numerous times but I don't think I'd ever do it. What I want is more or less to fall asleep and never wake up. I take drugs and the I'm not very concerned about overdose. I usually just smoke pot and drink occasionally. I like dxm too, but less frequently. I have so many abstract thoughts about life and the universe, and all the possibilities and shit. Like a 16 year old Rick. TINY RICK BITCHES! But on a more serious note I'm really looking for help from people who have been where I am now. I've been trying to think more positively in general to stop being such a cynic. I always seem to find the negative side of everything, but just like yin and yang there's always good hidden in the bad. Please help me find this good because it's only a matter of time before I end up like the rest of my family, brain dead with a needle in their arm. My father already had to pull the life support plug on his own brother and he's lost his mom as well. I abhor the thought of hurting my family any more than I already have, I don't need to be happy but I want to lift people up instead of being such an emotional anchor. 

TL;DR: I don't want to die but I wouldn't mind dying. i.e. If a guy was mugging me with a gun I'd tell him to put his money where his mouth is. I'm an emotional anchor dragging people down and all I want is to lift them up."

#HOWS LIFE?"
"Advice needed as soon as possibleI've never told anyone this because I have no one to tell and I'm afraid of being locking up, heavily medicated, embarrassing my family and putting them into debt because anything medical is expensive. I'm in my early thirties and I always have suicide in the back of my mind. I'm a professionally diagnosed highly functioning autistic with ptsd because of abuse, socially anxious, learning disabled, major depressive disorder, treatment resistant and generalized anxiety disorder.  I don't have any children or a significant other. I am divorced and because of this I had to move back in with my parents. I am constantly being told college isn't for me but I feel if I don't at least look into it I will never have a career or be able to live the life I long to live. I held a job for six months as a nursing assistant but couldn't do it anymore because it was very high stress job. I currently work at a gym, watching children who are dropped off by their parents so they can work out. It's low wage $8.00 hr and my hours are not consistent. I'm the oldest person there and I feel horrible about it. One month I will work near full time and the next it will be barely part time. I cannot deal with it anymore. I have been trying to look for another job while I keep this one because little money is better than none at all or having to ask my parents for money which makes me severely depressed even more because they aren't well off and they work very hard. I feel I am nothing but a screw up and everything is hopeless. I don't know what to do. I'm out of ideas. This isn't the life I wanted. I have tried to get disability but I was denied in court because they believe I am too high functioning. 

What are some jobs that pay a livable wage that don't require college that are suitable for introverts and are low stress??"
Teacher kicked me out of class for not helping my group Bro I was taking a massive shit
"Considering suicide more out of laziness than despair. More and more, I feel like I'm just not cut out to be an adult. 

I'm 28 years old. I'm mostly self-sufficient. I've got a job pays decently well (though I have to do freelance and will probably need a third job on top of that), I live in my own apartment, I cook for myself, and mainly do all the things people are supposed to do in order to maintain their lives. 

It's soul crushing. I've already made the decision that if I were suddenly to find myself in a life threatening situation, I wouldn't fight it. I want a bus to careen off the road and hit me. I want to be struck by lightning. I want to have a sudden, fatal heart attack. I want to just not have to be alive anymore. 

Everything costs money. Food costs money. Rent costs money. Electricity costs money. The simple act of being alive, it seems, costs money. Being alive, living, is an effort. A huge effort. It's not a default state but something that must be consciously maintained. You have to eat. You have to have shelter. You have to go to the dentist. You 
have to go to the doctor. And these all take time and cost money. There are no alternatives. Capitalism won the Cold War. This is society. This is the way things are done. This is LIFE. 

And Communism was no walk in the park either, at any rate. 

We work to get money. We wake up. Brush our teeth. Put on a tie, unless it's casual Friday. Run to catch the train. Elbow some guy in the gut because there's not a lot of room and you need your 1.5x1.5 square. We get to work. Get our coffee. Do something we hate. Something that goes completely and utterly against our principles. It's like a Jew working at a pork processing plant. But the money's good. You're not in college anymore. It's time to put all that idealism away. It's time to be an adult. You're not getting any younger. Do this. All day. Every day. Until you die. 

Life is full of worries. That project needs to be completed by Friday. That freelance assignment needs to be done by Monday. You've got to call the exterminator and get these silverfish out of your bathroom. And these are just your immediate worries. Meanwhile, oppression is happening on a mass scale all over the world. You directly benefit from it. In fact, part of your job is contributing to it. In a small part. But still a part. How did this happen? How did this become your life? 

Other people deal with it. You're not so self absorbed as to think that you're the only one suffering. You're not so naive to think you have it so bad. You live in a first world nation. You can get clean water whenever you want. You eat every day. You're comparatively healthy (though, you do smoke a lot...) What makes you different? Why can't you just accept what millions, billions, already accept? Why can't you just work for a living and like it? You entitled little shit. You're exactly what's wrong with America. Everyone works. You hate your job? So does every god damn fucking person in the world. THEY don't wanna die. Why do you? 

Because it's like a light switch going off in your head. One minute you're here. The next you're not. And all your problems vanish. You vanish. It doesn't matter that you've worked as hard as you can but you can't complete that project. It doesn't matter that your freelance assignments have dried up. It doesn't matter that you need to find a third god damn job on top of the two you already have. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters. Because you're dead. You don't have to worry about anything. Life is no longer happening to you. There's no need for decisions. No need for stress. No need for work. There's not even a need for a burial plot -- you don't care what happens to your body. Let some necrophiliac carve your corpse full of brand new orifices for all you care. 

You don't have to worry. About anything. 

Change jobs? God, even MORE fucking work. Sure, you can do it, but it's so much effort. Scouring jobs boards, going to networking events, writing cover letters, it's all so much much work. And you'll still be miserable. It's not the specific job. It's jobs in general. It's life in general. It's responsibilities in general. There will always be something that grinds you into dust. One leg gets tired, so you shift your weight until the other leg gets tired and then you shift your weight again over and over and over. I just want to sit down, but everyone else is standing. I'm just fucking lazy. Things that come easy to others is an arduous task for me. Getting out of bed, even, depresses me because I know it will be yet another day full of soul crushing responsibility. I'm not so entitled to think I deserve to not have to do with every god damned person does. But, still, I'd really rather not. I don't want to have to take care of myself. I don't want other people to take care of me. 

So: death. 

I don't know what, exactly, I hope to accomplish by this post. I only intended to write a paragraph or two and everything just came pouring out. I've been thinking these thoughts for years. I've never shared them with anyone. To outside observers, I'm the most cheerful fucking guy in the world. But I'm rotting like a soft log in a shallow pond, from the inside out. And one day. I'll split. 

tl;dr -- life is too much effort to maintain, so I've been considering giving it up. "

Everyone doesnât want to hang out, they say theyâre busy or leave me on delivered. The people who I treated with support and kindness during their tough times are ignoring me in my tough time. 

I honestly donât feel like I have any friends. I feel under appreciated, I feel like nobody cares about me unless itâs convenient to them. I know I feel sad becuase of my seasonal depression. But I know Iâve felt like this before it happened.

"Can i talk to someone please or someone give me a reason why i shouldnât overdose right now.[15M]
Hi. Can someone please convice me not to overdose rn. I had to build up massive courage to tell one of my friends that i was suicidle and tried to OD last week on Melatonin. I was asleep for 15 hours and was throwing up and fainting. He didnât believe me and made jokes about it. I feel like shit. I want to escape. I have ADHD, Severe anxiety, depression, PTSD. 
I get bullied. I get told to kill myself infront of my face. I get hit âas a jokeâ by people at school. If iâm outside i get shouted mean things to me. I just canât live anymore. I want to make the people who tell me to end myself happy. It would be a better place for everyone. Iâm such a burden, i canât do anything right at all. I have hurt myself because of it. And i will probably delete this account either in regret or if i do decide to do it. 

And yes, i do have a therapist who doesnât know of my attempt last week yet. I donât want anyone to know.

Is that possible?) I have always been slow but not this slow... it frustrates me so much.. if I have to live with a brain like this I think I rather just off myself right now...

It just feels like everything is working against me... cant I at least have one good thing about me to work from? If I have to be ugly why can't I be funny or smart or something?

"i just want to be loved and appreciated iâve been through too much of this same shit. my relationship is crumbling and i canât do much about it. i canât force the other side of this to care. 

last night i sobbed on the phone for iâm not sure how long. but it felt like a long time. and my boyfriend couldnât do anything, he didnât feel anything. and i donât think he feels anything right now. idk how much longer i can do this, where i donât feel loved or appreciated.

he hasnât put in much effort lately. it honestly feels like iâm carrying this relationship on my back and itâs exhausting because school is already taking so much out of me, i canât be the perfect girlfriend. i tried. even me trying isnât appreciated. nothing i do is appreciated anymore. he expected me to show him my body on call when i canât even look at myself in the mirror anymore. i suppressed emotions because it felt like if i didnât he would blow up at me and tell me he doesnât love me again. and i canât go through another time of my bf telling me he doesnât love me anymore. the emotional toll of that experience has proven true because i wonder every single waking moment if he still loves me. and i really shouldnât have to do that. his words are starting to hold much less weight over time because i donât know if he means it. and now my words arenât holding weight anymore because Iâd tell him that iâm okay when i really wasnât. i wanted to ease tension by putting aside my own feelings and just bottling them up. i never wanted to talk about them. 

heâs angry with me. and iâm angry at him for not showing any effort or sweetness. heâs angry at me for me getting angry. this is so exhausting. it feels like heâs taking me for granted or purposely pushing me away. it feels like he doesnât appreciate me being around anymore. i donât know how much more of this i can take. i just wanna stop existing. everything is so painful. 

earlier he told me âi hope you werenât lying about your exesâ. my exes have been toxic. one of them would only be happy if i sent nudes. another would compare me to girls all the time and gaslight me whenever i got upset about it. another one wouldnât show any emotion other than annoyance or disgust with me. theyâve all caused me to hate myself more and more. one after the other, my self hatred grows. partly because i let myself take this treatment and partly because i kept being told i wasnât good enough. over and over again. and i have the same feeling of me not being good enough.

i donât feel beautiful. i donât feel valued. i donât feel appreciated. i donât feel loved. i donât feel happy. 

i donât have enough friends to distract myself. iâve dedicated myself to the same person for the past 5 months and now i donât know if it was worth anything. mostly because i donât know if heâs willing to put in effort anymore. mostly because i think he knows he can find another girl very easily and discard me like the others. iâve sacrificed so much for one person, and my mom was right about how we get hurt when we put too much effort into one person. my mom was right when she said women are stupid when theyâre in love.

iâm getting back to that dark place in my life where i had no appetite. iâd weigh myself morning and day and make sure i only lose weight. iâm getting back to the point where i cry every night wondering if iâm worth anything to anyone and wondering if i disappeared if anything would change. i know at this point people would only benefit from my lack of existence. everyone in my life could stand a lot less me being around. i donât know what to do about this because if i talk to my boyfriend about this then heâd tell me iâm dumping my feelings onto him. i canât talk to my therapist half the time because our sessions are only 50 minutes and outside those sessions he takes a long time to respond. my parents arenât emotionally capable enough to empathize with me and help me get through this. i donât want to talk to this about my friends because itâs not their problem. i have no one right now. 

i just wanna poof out of existence."

"I dont know what to do anymore, i dont know what im doing on here, i dont know why im posting this, maybe i just need some help from someone on here.Can I just post a life story on here? Ima do that. (Sorry its so long)

Born in by parents 20 years apart so I have that going on for me already. When I was somewhere between 3 and 4 my mom left in the night and only left a note. I just played this off as ""oh brother needs mom too"" in my child mind. In that time my grandma kicked me and my dad out because she already didnt like us. Mom came back a few years and left again somewhere around 5 or 6 years old, I didntnknow where she went this time. I decided that my brother needed her again. I moved to a town a couple hours away from my grandma. Really ghetto town, had a sister there on my dads side, she was a druggy with an abusive boyfriend and my 3 nieces. Only parts I'm going to bring up there are i was forced to eat my own puke and saw my nice be thrown across a room for tying a knot wrong. We finally moved out of their place.

Then in a 1 bed apt with dad and made his bed every night with a beer on it (I thought that was normal and he always drank before bed) while he was in the shower, then went to bed. We moved into a house. Soon my mom came back. I was about 7 at this time. Missed a lot of school because I wanted time with mom but she never realized that, always yelled at me, was verbally abusive and always got drunk. I remember seeing her half naked on the bathroom floor while dad was rushing me away to clean her up. Got a dog. Loved that dog. Ended up as moms dog. Around 11 she left again, this time she brought me to the city to live with her friend and even brought me to see her boyfriend at the time. I should've known what was going on. My Christmas present was finding her gone. Important note: the last two times, the night before she left I had a bad feeling in my stomach, the second time I told her it was the same bad feeling as last time, she told me she loved me and promised to never leave me, but next morning she was gone. Took my dog with her. Called dad crying and asked him to come get me.

i had a friend that was using me for what I had, because I wasn't rich but I had nice things. Another friend, best friend, he introduced me to weed, it was a nice escape. Flash forward, was emo, suicidal and all that fun stuff. Was 13. Found someone I thought liked me. He was a cheating, lying bastard. Then he raped me, abused me, kept this going for 2 months and i didnt feel like I could leave. He made me worthless. I moved to different state.

Felt life was good for a minute, alright in school, few friends. Only complaint is dad started making these remarks. ""You're just like your mother, always sleeping around"" (I had mostly male friends, I liked to hand out with them, this made me stop hanging out with people) ""you're not going to graduate with these grades"" ""youre going to get held back"" (not as a how can I help you tone, as a disappointed tone and even if I tried to explain how differently school works he would continue to say that and make me feel bad) sucked because I was doing alright. Highschool started (T-T). i started making friends, still couldnt do the best in school, still had the remarks that hurt. My dad also had a tendency to touch my butt even though I asked him to stop several times. He finally agreed to let me go to therapy. (Was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, didnt go long enough to find out more) I was happy for some time. We lost our car. Couldn't make it to therapy. Waterslide back to depression. Had a ""good"" relationship in which he lied to me, more lies to hang out with friends (especially one that was very touchy with him, except ""its okay because I dont feel the same way"") his family hated me because I'm white. Lasted almost a year and we ended. During this my mom was told by doctors she had something wrong with her uterus. I found out that my mom had cancer, that the doctors before knew and didnt tell her. Its stage four ovarian cancer. This happened near beginning of year of relationship. She had conquered this for over a year. After relationship a r/niceguy kept badgering me into a relationship I wasnt ready for, I told him I needed time but he didn't care. I went to visit mom for Christmas. I didnt have time with mom, niceguy made me text him the entire time and if I didnt it would be fighting. A few months, on March 12 i got a call in the middle of school and missed it, called back after. My mom was in the hospital.

Was offered by family to get a paid flight to see her. Dad refused because it was too soon, I wouldn't make it, I had hours before the next flight, plenty of time for me. He agreed to let me go after those hours of convincing, had to go the next day. I arrive at grandmas house to visit mom in hospital. I'm sat down very confused. Mom died that morning. I didnt get to say goodbye because I was only hours late. I try not to blame dad for not seeing her, but it feels like it. Broke up with rebound. Time for myself. Not working, missed 2 weeks of school, couldnt catch up. Barely passed. Missed most of my 3rd year, barely passed. Didn't feel like I could talk to anyone. I tried asking dad to go to therapy over my mom. He tried my old therapist, she moved buildings. And one other therapist and gave up because ""too much paperwork"". left the building with him giving uncompleted packet and embarrassed because he yelled at the receptionist. he never tried, I didnt get therapy. His excuse for not trying is ""do you really need it? Lots of kids parents die"". Another relationship, most recent. Be ready for some serious bs.

Before relationship and for the first month I was his ""goddess"" type of thing. Soon went to shit. I was never his equal. He didn't trust me. What I knew about him was based on lies to make himself seem cooler. I was his first. But he still treated it like it was an every day activity. If he wanted to go somewhere or eat somewhere we went. If I wanted to, it took months to convince him. He sent memes of naked women because he thought it was okay, when he knew about my insecurities. He took me to a restaurant with the theme of sexy nurses, didn't ask if it was okay. Just went in, kept looking around at the waitresses in ""nurses"" costumes and TVs with sexual commercials. He never complimented me and treated like an object. For two months there was not a single bit of compliment or proudness, but then goes into full detail about a woman in his platoon who was ""so inspiring"". (btw he was marine corps but I went in relationship knowing he was joining) every day i let him rant about his day. I never got to say anything about mine. Ex rapist decides to message me. I went into a full blown panic attack, especially since one of my friends said he moved to the same city as I did. I blocked and deleted him right away. It was a whole different account than his main. Wanted to talk to boyfriend. His response ""it doesn't matter, he can't hurt you anymore"" then never said anything about it again. I get that ""he cant hurt you anymore"" is supposed to be comforting to someone but ""it doesnt matter"" is a bitch move. I told him a couple times about what happened with mom drinking, asked him not to drink ever, he promised. His birthday comes up, he keeps saying to me ""im going to drink on my birthday and theres nothing you can say to stop me"". His excuse ""I forgot about that story"" to him promising to not drink. ""I forgot"" are his two favorite words. Broke up with him recently, he was still saying he'd change, like he was saying for the entire year and a half. 

This school year my teacher gave me an opportunity, this is the first time in that program I was believed in. I had confidence and was teaching like I was supposed to. Was interrupted by the other teacher and told I was doing everything wrong. Went in later to ask what was wrong. It was like he was telling me someone else's story and kept trying to explain what was going on. Teacher that believed in me butted in (he hadn't seen what happened) and tried connecting it to how I was two years ago, when in reality id changed. I wanted to break down right there because the only person that believed in me couldnt believe my side of the story. Felt hopeless.

I don't know why im doing this. Maybe I wanted to rant? But I want help on what to do about the therapy situation, I don't want to call a hotline and I keep breaking down, I can't do this anymore...

Tldr: pretty shitty life, missed mom before she died because of my dad refusing. Afterwards I'm not allowed therapy because ""do you really need therapy? Lots of kids parents die"". Even shitter relationship and am no longer believed in by the one person who believed in me."
Anyone wanna talk? Im really lonely rn so does anyone wanna dm? I like playing games and if its anything i really like cricket. I watch netflix and shit. M15 for those wondering
"No! Punishing a person equally who falsely accused another of rape is not a good idea. Hear me out first  

This will probably get buried in New but I wanted to say this because I've been seeing these posts frequently about how accuser should be punished the same or even worse than a person who has committed a crime if it is a false accusation. Punishing them as equally bad misses the point. Rape is a crime that is notoriously difficult to prove. And if someone is not proven guilty then they are pronounced to be innocent(innocent until proven guilty). Regard this case : A man rapes a woman in her sleep, she wakes up to find out that she is being raped. She can't speak because she is in shock(which is wayy fequent than I'd like for it to be). If she goes to the police, she doesn't have any evidence to prove it, so the rapist is free. Would it be justified to punish her?

Not only that but the victims of abuse and assault, whether they be man or woman, always feels like they are at fault whereas the perpetrator usually believe that they are right in doing so.

What I think should be done instead is that they should apologise and then the media should clarify that the accused was innocent. It's not a full proof plan so I would like to have a civil and logical discussion about it. And please don't bring your feelings into this. I'd love to have better ideas about this problem here."

"I don't know if it's me.This is a throwaway account. 

I just don't know if it's me anymore. Things with my mom have been getting worse and worse, and I think she thinks it's all my fault. I think it's her. We fight all the time, and some of the things that she says breaks my heart. We have so different perceptions of what's going on, I just don't know who's right anymore. I can't tell if she's right, and I'm the one who's making everything harder, or if it's the opposite, and I'm right. Or does it even matter? I don't know. I'm honestly just so tired of trying to figure it out. 

Thank you for listening."
"Just saying it out loudEver sense my mom died. My life has rather taken a down hill turn. My job laid me off for two mouths now.
Friends donât want to see me. Or they just wanna ask for money then leave. Girl of my dreams runs to me for help then as soon as I help her she leaves. Best friend only want to use me to move out, but wonât take no for a answer. 
 Then any time I get interested in a girl I get rejected. Because of the fact I can speak well. My speech has gotten worse to the point I developed a stutter and stammer.
I repeatedly have muscle spasms about when I think about stuff like my mom past relationships."

"Why I'm hereA few days ago I called the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. I was connected with a very nice lady that asked me a few key questions at the very beginning of our conversation. She immediately wanted to know if I was planning to end my life that moment and if I had a means to do so, like if I had a gun with me or something. I told her no that I was just sitting in my car. She then asked me on a scale from 1 to 10 how do I feel about hurting myself within the hour, 10 being the highest and obviously one being the lowest. At that particular time I was feeling like a 7 but I still had control to some degree over my emotional state. About that time I heard a ring on her side and she told me to hold on one moment as she answered the phone and if I could please wait. I told her sure. I waited a few minutes and she came back and apologize for the wait. I told her it was fine. She asked me if I ever tried to commit suicide in the past I told her once when I was younger around 15. At this particular time I felt like there's no point in trying to hide anything considering I was feeling like ending everything so honesty was basically the only way I was going to say anything. After I told her that she had another phone call and had to put me on hold again and apologized. I did kind of wonder if she was kind of working alone since she was interrupted twice within the span of maybe 10 minutes or so. Totally not her fault I was just surprised that she didn't have more help. When she got back to me a few minutes later she apologized and I told her it was completely fine. For some reason I felt like I had all the patience in the world, I still can't figure that out. She asked me if I had anyone I could talk to or some kind of support group. I told her no I did not. And this is why I am here on Reddit. She told me that I might be able to find some encouragement or a support group here on Reddit. This is my very first post. I've never used reddit before. To be honest I'm still not exactly sure what this is but I decided to at least post this. I would like to make a quick comment about the National Suicide Prevention hotline, the lady I spoke to was very nice and at the end of our conversation though it was interrupted a few times at least gave me a few minutes to think rationally without extreme emotion. For what it's worth it got me here to post this."
"Itâs 4:29 AM and iâm thinking of doing it.I fear death, but Iâm constantly thinking of committing suicide. I struggle heavily with social anxiety and iâm entirely unable to live my daily life, i think about how i could end it all. though i promise myself i would never attempt to harm myself, i find myself thinking of the outcomes, I would be disappointed in myself for wasting my loved onesâ time, draining their resources, and causing them so much trouble. I desperately need someone, please."

"What the fuck did I do? What the fuck can I do?I paid a super sexy tweaker girl for a skype show last night. Turns out she's high risk. I triggered her inadvertently by referencing the borderline personality disorder she mentioned. After a few hours of several confusing, alarming message exchanges, she claimed to have attempted suicide and stopped responding.

Now she claims (general post on her tumblr, not to me) to have failed in her attempt. I messaged her the number for her local mental health crisis services, no response.

I'm worried sick for this person I barely know who I may have pushed over an edge I couldn't recognize. How do those of you committed to preventing suicide deal with this blind brinksmanship, this constant eggshell walk?"
"Issues.With all my other issues. I now know I have body dysmorphic disorder.
 Just great.
 Much more and I am just going to push up the time frame. I don't know how.much more I can't hate myself.
I know my abusers put most of it in my head, but it was gone for 30+ years and NOW it decides to come back. Depression, fucks you everytime.
I need help. I talking to the wife tomorrow,  if she can help I know she will. 
But is it fair to lay all my bullshit on her? I mean I'm a mess and I know it, but I don't show it.  I keep it all inside. I don't know how she will handle me all fucked up. 

Fucking a."
"My cousin killed himself 3 months ago, and it's made me think about my own suicidal tendencies.Let me begin by saying that I haven't actively tried to kill myself in years.  I used to self harm too, but I guess you can say I've replaced one vice with another (frequent self-induced vomiting).

I know that my cousin tried to kill himself about 15 years ago, wasn't successful, and was hospitalized.  I know that he suffered from depression.  And I never reached out to him.  I was so focused on my own problems that I never tried to help him through his own.  I feel immense guilt over it, but here I am thinking about my problems again.

After my cousin killed himself, a lot of old feelings I had about my father's passing (he died from brain cancer) 3 years ago resurfaced.  I can't help but mourn both my cousin (who in a way was like a big brother to me) and my father all over again.  I feel selfish for thinking about myself and how I have put people through so much crap with my self harming/vices and suicidal tendencies.

I miss them both so much.  It doesn't help that my family is keeping his suicide a secret, either.  I have to lie to people and say he had a work-related injury, which is such bullshit.  They're keeping it a secret to ""protect"" his grandma from the truth.  One of the harder things I've done was lie to her when she pulled me aside and asked me ""what really happened to him"" because the story didn't add up--she isn't stupid.

I feel so overwhelmed.  I'm going to see a doctor about my vomiting next week so hopefully I'll get on the right track to recovery for myself.  I just wish it wasn't too late for my cousin."
"The CCP wants a picture of me So uh yeah thatâs fun. Guess Iâm not going back to China like ever. 

Seriously considering just sending them a pic of my dog."
"Nothing helps anymoreThe last 2 months I've been through a lot. I was going to kill myself last month but a friend called the police before I could complete it.

Now Ive been trying. Hospitals, psych, new meds. But I'm coming off a 12 day manic Phase. Now the depression is back.

I had a stroke and can't do stuff by myself anymore. I feel like I've achievdd nothing and have nothing to achieve.

Ive been writing those letters. I'm still trying to stay alive. But it's harder than ever."
"I just want to go to sleep foreverWhen I talk about suicide, Iâm not seeking attention or being overdramatic, so thatâs why I donât like to talk to people about this, however I think about killing myself every day. I donât want to be the weird girl that always looks at the negative side of things or the selfish girl that had everything but was too blind to see it. I donât want to make people lives harder than itâs, I donât want to make people more worried about life or me, I donât want to worry my mom, I donât want her to be worried about me when she canât do anything about it, she is in the other side of the globe, I donât worry my dad, I donât want him to spend the money that he earned with his hard work on me, I donât want to make my boyfriend live harder, by me overthinking every day, every minute and every second, I want to be gone. When I love I love a lot, with all my heart and all my energy and I feel that people donât understand that and call me âtoo muchâ I donât want to be too much, but unfortunately, I am, I donât like to talk and make plans with people other than my boyfriend (I guess you can call me unsocial), so when Iâm not with him, I feel lonely and lost, and when he goes away from me because he had too much I feel that he doesnât need me, he wants me gone. Iâm the cause of every single argument, Iâm the cause of all the rough time that he goes through, Iâm the cause of him not being as happy, when a met him almost two years ago, he was one of the happiest people that I knew, so kind, so soft, understandable and caring, now I look at him almost every day and I think âwhat did I do with the love of my lifeâ I donât deserve nothing good in life, if fucking ruined that life of someone that I love and care about, I should not be here. My mom is broken because of me, because she sold everything that she can to give me the opportunity to study in a different country, and here Iâm just wasting my life without a purpose in life, no living just existing, and for my dad I feel bad for not being the perfect child, not being more like him, but instead being what he doesnât believe that is real. âLife will get betterâ NO! life was supposed to get better a long long ago, but it didnât. Maybe I appreciate my sleep as much as I do because itâs the only time of the day that Iâm peaceful with myself, no worries, no guilt, no overthinking, none of that, I just want to be gone, I just want to go to sleep forever. 

i hate everything about me, my looks, personality, my ways... Iâm living with my boyfriendâs family because Iâm broke, I cant pay rent and they felt bad for me. im a joke."
"My last attempt triggered a psychosis. Turns out I have schizophrenia. Now what?After staying in a crappy Ukrainian hospital for a month I'm back home. I sleep for 15 hours a day so I don't have to face reality. Don't tell my psychiatrist, she would be mad if she found out about my sleep schedule. The remaining 9 hours is still too much. I don't have any friends, irl or online. I go for walks with my mom because going outside is supposed to be good for you. I'm trying to find work as a freelance audio engineer, but can't find clients. I've read this book called You Are The Placebo and trying to do the meditation described there because there's nothing else to do.

After writing schizophrenic nonsense to people I'm scared of making new friends online. I'm stuck. Can't even afford another suicide attempt. Trying to stay positive, but it's hard when there's no support other than a silly book."
"On the verge of itSo Back in January this girl Iâve been awkward snap friends with (I liked her back last summer, but my friend who knew this went behind my back with her for a month until he finally told me and I just never got to know her better, they broke up about a week before I first talked to her again) got home from a party and had no one else to talk too, and since we were already snapping she FaceTimed me. After that things just sorta kicked off with us and for the next 3 weeks we were basically dating w/o calling it dating

Come Valentineâs Day, she calls me in the morning and tells me she canât be with me right now because sheâs just not ready to jump back in and has too much going on, which is understandable. So for the next 6 months we just keep getting to know each other and weâre now basically each otherâs best friend. The whole time though I had been waiting for her to make her decision about us, and today she finally made it

I was over at her house and just kinda bugging her about telling me cause she had said she was gonna tell me soon. So as Iâm about to leave she looks at me and says âIâm sorry but I just canât date youâ. i stayed at her house for another 5 hours or so talking until I had to leave. Now Iâm home, just feeling so empty and lonely, and Iâm completely distraught.

She was everything to me. Sheâs the most beautiful girl Iâve ever met and I just love everything about her. I just feel so worthless right now. The possibility of being with her was the only thing keeping me going during the last few months and now Iâve lost it and I canât do this anymore. Nothing good happens to me my whole life is just shit, sheâs the only good that the world has given me and any chance with her is gone

Please, I just need help"
"I'M SICK OF DISAPPOINTING PEOPLE (Just warning, I do talk about Religion and many debates that has been had on the basis of Religion)Guess who's about to fail Home Economics-YET AGAIN- because they can't focus, can't write properly, can't be stuck in a crowded kitchen for an extended period of time otherwise they will have a breakdown-and that's why they sit by themselves during that class, because they feel like everyone else hates them-including the teacher. And whenever the teacher says to ""Get into groups"", this person has no one to be with, because those two people they actually know a little bit and somewhat feel comfortable around are already in groups of people this person doesn't know. This person feels like a burden to whichever group they get placed in, because they always end up having nothing to do, so they spend time washing the dishes and drying them but really, it's not THAT bad, until the teacher says more people need to help with dish duty and this person gets extremely nervous to be around other people. Hell! This person even had a mental breakdown before class, even though they had all their ingredients, they just did not have anyone to work with, which made them nervous and they started to shake and cry. The one time anyone did want to work with them, is because that group forgot that we needed to bring food to cook with that day, and so just took over all the stuff this ONE, THIS SINGLE PERSON, brought in. AND THESE OTHER PEOPLE, HAD THE AUDACITY! -TO STICK THE ONE WHO BROUGHT THE INGREDIENTS-ON DISH DUTY! NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THEY TOOK BIGGER PIECES OF THE FINAL PRODUCT HOME WITH THEM! THESE OTHER PEOPLE ALSO LET A GIRL WHO WASN'T EVEN THERE FOR THE COOK, TAKE A PIECE! LEAVING THE ONE WHO BROUGHT THE INGREDIENTS, WITH A TINY SLICE! Whatever this person does, always works out in a negative way. They feel worthless. Even the fake smile this person puts on is starting to slip. They had to go to a psychologist because of the hole of bad habits they dug themselves into was too deep for anyone to get them out of. But this person, does not want to get out. They really don't. This person feels empty inside. Hopeless and lost. Even those who should be closest to them, this person feels like their family hates them. They hate everyone else to an extent though. But those levels of rage differ from person to person. Sometimes itâs low. Sometimes itâs high. They know they are constantly going to fail and let others down, so most of the time, they donât even try to make an effort. Failure is inevitable. Their passions have become procrastinations. They could write a whole book, cover to cover, of ways of how they want to end their life. They could write poems of ways to torture others, slowly, gruesomely, mercilessly. This person could lecture the demons of Hell about how they deserve to burn, about how they arenât needed. Begging, pleading to the Devil themselves, to take this person away forever. THIS PERSON CANâT STAND LOOKING AT THEMSELVES. AT THE FEMALE BODY THEY HAVE, BUT STILL DETEST. TRIPLING THEIR OFFENDERS. WAKING THE UNSPOKEN RULE. Perfect isnât a word this person likes. In fact, theyâd rather die than have someone call them perfect. No one is. Nothing is. No single moment is ever perfect for them. There is always a doubt chewing away at the darkest parts of their subconscious thoughts. Too weak to end it. Too cowardly to keep going. The bright lights of the trains and cars are mesmerising to them. They can imagine those same lights being the last thing they ever see. They can imagine looking up from Hell to see the unfazed faces of those they knew. Their old room an empty tomb, their tomb. Why looking up you may ask. They have read the Holy verses of the book society bows before in a skirmish. They have lectured others like them, that society must bend and contort to become heterosexual and cisgender, for heaven admission. And they hate it. They have tried and tried again to shape themselves into that mould. But have found out, too late, that others have made their own moulds. Moulds made just for them by them. And this person is still trying to make one for themselves. But the crushing weight of expectations and reality is keeping them from their ultimate goal of trying to find a place for them to be, to feel, to act normal. Why canât they just be normal like society wanted? Like they wanted. They didnât want to suffer under the hands of themselves. Their toxic actions, behaviours and mindset are the things that keep them down. Writing essays to try and piece together the hatred they bear towards themselves and others. THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE TREATED AS AN EQUAL! ***I have no right to be treated as an equal***."
"I almost did it... I still might.Wow what a shit show life has been for me since 2019, the purpose of this post isn't to rant about how shitty the situation is because I've already left a bunch of reddit posts about that. I just wanted to tell someone, anonymously about my suicide attempt.

On top of already being suicidal, I was just laid off temporarily from work. I had decided that was a sign that yes. It's time to finally end things. I wrote up a suicide note, and prepared a different 2nd note for my facebook profile. I'm ashamed to admit I didn't have a plan for my bird, but I poured out all the food I have for her (more than a months worth) into various bowls, and poured a bunch of bowls of water for her to survive off of until I'm found. I sat down with her, and held her, and pet her as I told her about what was happening, what I was about to do, and that I'm sorry she's going to have to fend for herself for awhile until someone comes to rescue her. It was so fucking hard, I love her so much, I said goodbye.

I've already read The Final Exit, and have a plan ready to go. I got everything I feel is important ready. Skipping many of the steps recommended in the book. I left the bird cage door wide open and went into my room alone, and closed the door. Put the bag over my head and fastened the elastics around my neck. As I sat there for a minute, breathing into the bag, feeling the oxygen fade away. I got really scared. I calmly removed the bag, and just sat in my bed, in the dark for a really long time... I was second guessing myself. My life has been literally nothing but a downward spiral since the start of 2019. I almost feel like, fuck man, conditions HAVE GOT to improve at some point... Right? Like I don't really believe in karma, or god or anything. But is it really possible that life can just sort of have it out for someone, and bully them continuously for what seems like their entire life until they decide to kill themselves?

I constantly complain that I have an absurd amount of bad luck, as if I was cursed or something. My friends can vouch. They've also heard me say many times. If the world could just fuck off for 6 months. Leave me alone, I'm positive I could build myself back up, get healthy routines going and then once 6 months are up let the shit show resume and I'll be able to handle it. I'm just so overwhelmed, it feels like I cant ever catch a break. So as I'm sitting there thinking all this. I'm wondering, is this a sign that its time to go? Or is this the break I keep asking for, where shit is gonna leave me alone, give me time to get everything in order, and in 6 months be fully back on my feet and ready for the challenge? I'm not sure which is the right answer."
"Is it possible to study 200 chinese characters in 3 days? I have a test on Tuesday and I'm planning to study 6 hours today, 6 hours tomorrow and 4/5 hours on Monday.

"My jumbled thoughtsLife isn't really that hard. I face a lot of things that I think are difficult, but when I look at it from a different point of view, it isn't really that hard.People always say ""life gets better"" but I don't believe that. I tried to think about why my life is so pitiful but than I realized that my life will never get better if I'm the one living it. I'm a very stupid, rude, and annoying person. I feel intense levels of guilt and feel like my mental health has deteriorated so much, and my head hurts from thinking too much. The funny thing is I'm at least very good at not showing it. My family thinks I'm a very happy person, and my acquaintances, classmates,  and teachers think I'm a very smart and good person. A few times people have even said to me ""it must be nice not to have any problems"",""everything is easy for you because you're perfect"", and ""I wish I could be as perfect as you"". I'm really sorry to everyone I've deceived. I'm sorry to everyone who had high hopes for me and believed in me. I'm very very sorry. I truly want to be perfect, but I'm a horrible, disgusting and scummy human being. Why can't I just become better? People say the first step to changing your life is to change yourself. But I don't even know where to start. I've now become a person who is so emotionally numb I'm unable to cry when I'm sad, scream when I should be mad, or fight for anything. I can only fake my emotions when I need to. I've become a person who is seen as twisted and calculating if I were to talk about myself, my thoughts or opinions. So I don't do that. Im 19 years old at the moment, some people would call me young, but why does it feel like I'm so old and at the end of my life already? Every decision I make feels like it will determine how my life will go, and ever mistake I make feels like it will be with me forever. I just want my life to end already, but I'm unable to do it myself. I go to sleep every night hoping that I can become better, that things can become better, and truly praying that I don't wake up the next morning. Im not particularly scared of death and pain, but whenever I try, I think about how those around me will react, and then I never go through with it. Anyway, writing any of this makes me feel like a ridiculous child. I should learn to suck it up, and to not complain or whine again. I don't know why I'm writing this even. Maybe because I can never say it or share this with anyone else."

"A plan that worksI am in my late 30's with nothing to show for it.
I have lost or given up through foolishness the beautiful things in my life. 
I just destroyed the new life I spent a year putting together in a new city after throwing away the best real relationship I ever had.  
Now homeless 
No job
I am sleeping / typing this in a storage shed in cold weather. 
I have few friends left and am ashamed of myself on front of them. 
I'm a so-called high functioning autistic
The fuck is that?  Do I appear to function at anything? 
I am tired of not being able to make connections that last. I'm tired of fearing going to work because people think I am odd. 
I'm just tired.  Life has lost its fun. 

I have a good and painless plan

sorry boys and girls. Figure out your own. I'm not going to have my last act be to contribute to your death.  My choice, my plan,  my responsibility.  As it is I am going to fuck up the few people left that love me. 

But I have a plan and the more I think about it the better I feel,  the happier I get.  This can end.  No after life.  Just worm food.

 I wish I could do it without damaging anyone but what's one more fuckup.  I'm going to do my best to explain it to them. They will survive. 

I'm not sure how this ends for me.  Maybe tomorrow I get up and don't feel like closing shop. But if I do, I am prepared. And I think this time is going to be different.  It won't hurt, I'll feel calm,  there's no doubt I'll die. I've built it into The Plan.  So I think the time is right.  Just a few more days to prepare and then adios muchachos. May 15th is looking good. I hope it's a warm night.

"I successfully completed an entire 45-minute lesson (and its homework) without any distractions whatsoever. This includes reddit. I know a lot of these kinds of posts are satire and joke-like (at least for this sub), but I feel pretty accomplished because it was a big step for me. I always get sidetracked doing schoolwork, but I managed to pull myself together for an entire 45 minutes without checking reddit, staring mindlessly at my screen, or looking out the window.

It feels amazing and I wanted to share. How was your school day?"
"ONLINE SCHOOL Ok Iâll be honest. I enjoy online school. There I said it. For me the pressure is just mostly taken off and I can do what I want (to some extent). I have 5 lessons a day, most of them calls, however at my school you donât have to have your camera on. I do struggle to remain focused (in fact, in a way Iâm procrastinating by doing this as Iâm supposed to be in English).
Anyone got any advice on how to stay focused and not procrastinate the whole time?!"
"Afraid to postIâm sure Iâm being overly sensitive but I thought the reason people posted here was to possibly find someone to talk to or to get something off of their chest. My last post ended with someone telling me to just do it since I had it all planned out so well. Maybe Iâm just not tough enough for the internet as well as not being strong enough for life or suicide. 

Iâm sure there are plenty of you out there feeling trapped. Canât live, canât die. Iâve been sleeping all day but my sleeping pills rarely work any more. Iâm just laying here alone now wishing I had the strength to do something."
"I can't do this anymore.I don't even know what to say. I think I'm done, no matter how hard I wish I wasn't. I wish I had at least one person in my life who I could talk to."
"me, his honeyiâve decided on a day the first day of winter break. i canât make myself do it before his birthday. this time i wonât hesitate. more pills than last time, no goodbyes. itâs gonna hurt so much. i just wanted our family. we picked names, hazel and dominic. i need to make arrangements and set some things straight before so iâll be busy. i want to leave this here as my goodbye, because i couldnât make it to him here it goes



sweetheart iâm so deeply sorry. i just want you to be happy baby thatâs all i want. i donât want you to go. i keep hurting you baby. i donât want to hurt you bunny. iâm not a good girlfriend, iâm not even a good friend. i donât want you to hate me justin. youâre my soulmate. iâd give everything up to be strong and happy for you justin, absolutely everything and anything. you saved me, never doubt that. you make me happy, never ever ever fucking doubt that. itâs the time without you that makes me like this. when iâm with you everything is quite literally perfect, iâm not sad, iâm not hurt. nothing from the past matters when iâm with you besides our time together. iâve never felt this much love and pride in someone. since your older i was made for you. but if i has been older you wouldâve been made for me. my perfect match. my other half. truly my other half. youâre the strongest most breathtaking person iâve ever had the absolute joy of meeting. see you in the next life precious. maybe there i can stay with you. i can love you. we can have our family. iâll always be the girl you called honey"
"How much more of thisBirthdays matter to me.

I donât know why I feel so ashamed of that. I feel like everyone around me acts like itâs an incredibly childish thing to take birthdays seriously, but theyâve always been important to me. Not just my own, but everyone elseâs as well. I always go out of my way to make sure I think of an incredibly personable gift for people close to me, and I always make sure to send a message or give a call to make sure they know I care about them. In my mind, you always talk to the people that matter most to you on your birthday, because their sheer presence makes your day better, you know? The people you choose to talk to on YOUR day are the number one people in your life.

It kicks me in the teeth so fucking much. I wear my heart on my sleeve and it utterly destroys me. I do so much for other people because I just want them to do the same for me, but they never do. I feel like a selfish, greedy, shitty person thatâs motivated by my own desires. But I LIKE to make other people happy. I also like to be made happy, and I feel like that never happens. I know in school all they talked about about was âthe golden ruleâ. Youâre supposed to treat people like you want to be treated. I try really hard to be a good person, because I was a shitty kid. Doesnât fucking matter, though.

Thereâs so much big trauma in my life, but Iâm just the Queen of Small Moments. All of my hurt that keeps me up every night, is there when I take another hit, swallowing me whole sobbing on the carpet, itâs all small things people have said or done. I feel so fucking stupid. I remember when my ex told me that my hair was better before, even after knowing how much any sort of small comment about how I look digs at me like a fucking knife, and Iâve never forgotten it. I remember being told that Iâm too much of an emotional burden for anyone to ever love me, and how true that is. I remember all the times people told me youâre not supposed to celebrate birthdays after you get out of preschool, and how much it stung. Theyâre not even big deals, so why do they destroy me? I feel like being raped, sexually abused, neglected, are far more impactful, but yet my brain just spins and spins on the inane comments. 

I swing between extreme levels of apathy and empathy. The latter is the fucking worst. I read one remotely emotional thing and I start to sob. Iâd throw myself into a vat of hot oil if it meant it would make someone feel better. I don't bring anything else to the world. I'm not talented or smart. I set myself up for being let down. 

I remember ever since I was 12, I told myself I would kill myself when I became an âadultâ. Iâve never wanted to deal with it. Not ever. Iâm fucking tired of people telling me, âwelcome to the adult worldâ. I FUCKING KNOW WHAT IT IS. Iâm not dense. I knew what it was. Get up, go to work, come home, be tired, go to sleep, wake up, go to work. On your days off, you have shit to take care of. Not that I ever have. I never wanted to pay bills. I never wanted to wake up in an empty apartment and buy groceries. I never want to blink and be 30 and realize Iâve done fucking nothing. Iâve always said I would fuck around in my teenage years, and then kill myself, but Iâve even failed that. Iâve spent the entirety of that time being damn miserable, in and out of hospitals, in and out of explosive relationships as a live grenade. I've tried to kill myself before, but it's never enough.

I think most people would be seriously happy with my job, maybe even my life. For the first time in my life, genuinely the first, I feel so appreciated. Everyday Iâm told Iâm doing a good job, that Iâm smart, a âbreath of fresh airâ. It feels good for ten seconds. Today, the head chef took my aside to tell me how truly impressed he was, and that he didnât want to lose me, and that if I ever had any problems he wanted me to go to him and he would address it. I got a raise, which is something I never expected to happen. Iâm due for a review in three months, and he told me that if I kept what Iâm doing now, my hourly would go up another dollar.

Like, what the fuck? Shouldnât I be happy right now? Iâm not. My birthdayâs in a week. I get to spend 12 hours working alone in the back of a kitchen, and then go home to nothing again. Normally I would at least go out with my dad, but heâs not even here anymore. My last birthday ever, and itâs the same thing it will always be. I donât have any friends. The last time I had a party, I was 6. No oneâs going to message me. No oneâs going to come with something personable and true to the heart. Because NO ONE FUCKING CARES. They never have. I donât love myself, because there is nothing to love, so why would anyone else? I donât know why it surprises me. 

Iâm an âadultâ now. I hate it, just like I always thought I would. Iâm not meant to be alive. Thereâs so much shit wrong with my brain, I feel like one of those people that just reads about a mental illness on Wikipedia and decides itâs them. The only way I can even do my job at all is a fuckton of drugs. Even then, it doesnât matter. Iâm crashing just as I always do. Iâll turn around and never show up again. Iâm trying so hard to make an impact on someoneâs life, somewhere, so at least thereâs something left behind.

Iâm so fucking sad. I told myself I wouldnât cry at work, not like at my last job, but I finally broke down today. No one noticed, but I feel like a jackass anyways. All I can do is lay on the floor and cry. Iâd love to just slip into another manic episode, believe myself to be an apostle of death or some sort of god, but it doesnât even matter. Iâm sure I could swing around, then swing back, then swing around again, and again, and again. But Iâve never wanted to live past this, not ever. I donât know how anyone is ever genuinely happy, it just doesnât make any sense to me.

I really wanted to drive my body into the ground, just work myself to death like some sort of model citizen. I donât know if I will or not. I donât know what Iâll do, at all. I donât want my birthday to come up. The sadness I feel over it is causing me so much guilt, which in turn creates more sadness, which creates more guilt. Iâm so fucking broken. I donât want to spend another birthday with a reminder of the extent of how alone I really am. That no one is going to care about me like I care about them. I really donât. It makes me want to scream.  I hate and Iâm sad. I want it to be over, for good. I always did. Even in death Iâm fucking pathetic. I was never meant to exist; Iâm like an albino deer, never meant to breathe beyond to be an easy kill. I fucking hate everything that I am. I hate that my brain is so not-normal I canât even comprehend why someone would enjoy life. I just want death to come. I want to die in my sleep, have a heart attack when no oneâs around. Just let it fucking end.

Waste of time and space.

For the past 6 years I have struggled with depression and anxiety, and for the last time I canât take it anymore. Countless therapist appointments, counselor appointments with my community college that I canât even attend to because of my psychotic ass, arguments with my mother, stressors, unmotivation, the list goes on. So much testing and reaching out but to no avail. 
For years I have gone on life in the shadow of myself. I have attempted suicide multiple times, Iâve sat on my toilet black out drunk, Iâve spent weeks on end  high, trying to escape this feeling. But I canât, I just canât. No matter what I do it always comes back and it always ruins what little I have built up for myself. I canât take this, I canât anymore. I am trying so goddamn hard but I canât do this. 
Iâm searching for new jobs. Iâm scheduling for doctors. Iâm trying to workout. Iâm trying again at community college. But I canât fucking do this anymore. I am such a burden, a waste of time and money. All of my resources that I have used are essentially temporary, leading up to moments like Iâm having now. Itâs a cycle that I canât do. Iâm so sick and tired of crying, so tired of being tired, sick of being worthless. 
Iâm done. I canât go on like this any longer. I am giving myself to the end of the week.
I have a bottle of Xanax and a bottle of a high dosage sleeping pills. Right now Iâm writing apology letters to my boyfriend, my grandmother and my best friend. 
Iâm so sorry. Iâm so sorry.

Lately, Iâve been thinking a lot about my past. From ages 8 to 12, I was molested by my (at the time) brother-in-law. At the time, I knew it was wrong, but I was terrified of him and my family. It finally ended when I told a friend from the internet that I was being hurt by someone close. When the friend messaged my sister, she confronted me about it and I told her that he had only asked to kiss me, because I didnât want him to hurt me. My mother and sister confronted him and he went along with the lie. We werenât left alone together after that. 

Around 18, my sister found out the entire truth but didnât want me to tell anyone because she doesnât want to stop receiving child support for my niece. The longer I keep quiet, the more I want to end it. Iâve wanted to die since I was 10, and I think Iâve finally gotten the courage to do it. 

Iâm telling my mom this Friday. Antidepressants and anxiety medication hasnât helped. Seeing a therapist hasnât helped. I want my mom to know so that she can watch out for my niece when Iâm gone. Iâm so fucking tired. "

He didnât move from that spot. I picked him up today and he was completely stiff with one eye open. He was comfortable, and full.

"It's all my faultLast year around this time I never would've thought that I'd be in this situation.

Back in September I was a college student, struggling with a class that was causing me stress. I wanted to drop it but I couldn't because my dad (who pays the tuition) said that if I dropped under 12 credits, he'd ""jam me up"". That, combined with an upcoming exam in the class, pushed me to suicide.

I took 200 pills, where I regretfully texted my mom 'I'm sorry', and the university police were in my dorm room. 

I had to do inpatient.

I thought I was ready to return to class after missing 2 weeks of classes, but I wasn't. I was overwhelmed and ended up dropping all of my classes one by one. 

Since I left in the middle of the semester, I had to pay the balance I owed to the school. 1K. My dad made it clear that he would not help. Neither would my mom. They said that if I paid for my own education, I'd be less likely to kill myself. Just yesterday, my dad said he's not going to help me return to school because he is still affected by my suicide attempt six months ago.

But that's the thing. I need to go back to school. I'm a shut-in living in an area where you need a car to do anything. I can't drive and my parents refuse to teach me because they don't want me to kill myself. Yet my dad says things to me like ""you're in this situation because you don't do what I tell you."" and yells at me when I try to tell him how I feel.

I don't have anyone my own age to talk to. The only time I leave the house is to see my therapist and psychiatrist. So I've decided to get a job.

However, when I did get a job at the end of December as a pharmacy technician, I had a break down on the first day on the job and quit. Ever since then, I haven't been able to find a job. I've gotten a few interviews, probably because I went to school from 2013-2017, and it looks like I graduated. (I didn't. I dropped out in 2015 and returned in 2016. I even say no degree but they ignore it) As soon as I clarify that I don't have a degree, the tone of the interview changes.

Since then, I have not been able to find a job. I've been searching for 6 months. At first I was only looking in clerical and administrative, but for the last two months I opened up to anything that doesn't explicitly say degree required, including minimum wage jobs. Yet I still don't get anything.

My aunt and cousin believe this is because God is punishing me for not going along with his plan of me being a pharmacy technician. I'm not religious in the slightest, but I believe(d) there is a God. However, I believe that they are right. Especially because my prayers are going unanswered, and things are getting worse. My belief in a god now is wavering.

I've opened myself to jobs in cities where my family lives, using their addresses. However, still... nothing. I need to get out of this state. There's nothing here, but I can't. I can't leave. You can't leave when you're balls deep in debt and have no money. 

Yes... Not only do I owe 1K to the school (which I am to start paying on April 30th, I arranged the payment plan for two months ago because I thought I'd have a job by then) but my student loans start being repaid next month. I am going to defer them but at the same time... The stress of it over my head is...

It doesn't help that my sister, who is 18 months younger than me, is doing so well. She's a compsci major and will be graduating next fall. She has a car and an apartment and will probably get a nice job. People say that I can't compare myself to her, but it's hard not to when you have nothing going on.

As for my therapist and psychiatrist... I had to see them when I left inpatient thanks to the social worker. The psychiatrist is more helpful because the meds did help, but the therapist... I've been through 3. The first was a horrible one that pushed for a family session and then completely ignored everything I said for my dad. The second one was great and we were actually making progress but she left the practice. The current one... she is giving me job seeking tips like I haven't done them already. A lot of people do that, and it makes me feel worse.

I think I'm at the point where therapists can't help me, because my issues are external. The only way I can feel better is if I get a job. But therapists can't do that. Unfortunately, I have to see a therapist to keep my psychiatrist.

I've planned to do it on April 30th. At this point, nothing can change my mind. It's like... if you don't have a college degree, you aren't meant to live. It's like some kind of natural selection... where the ""uneducated"" die off... I'm just stuck. I've always felt stuck no matter what I do. I'm 23, but my life feels like it's over before it began.

Before, I used to tell myself that if I killed myself, I would go to hell. However... Now I don't care. God clearly hates me anyway. As I was typing this up I got another rejection email. Nice. That's clearly all I deserve.

People keep telling me that a job is coming and that it all works out in the end and that when you're at the end of your rope it always turns around. If that's true, why isn't it changing for me? What am I doing wrong? Why is everything getting worse when it should be getting better? I don't want to know the answer to that question. But what I do know is that life is bullshit, and I'm giving up. It's all my fault.

I think people are all excited to help initially, but the reality sets in at some point that they canât do anything, so they stop trying.  They still feel obligated to act like they care, because if I ever actually did it, they want to feel like they did everything they could.  I get that.

"Why are you suicidal? Here's a personal story as to why I'm not even when the world think I am, and why I think you probably shouldn't be.Story Part, Feel free to skip if TL;DR
--

I've been accused of being suicidal since high school.


A friend of mine committed suicide at a boarding school, and soon after, I was accused of suicidal ideation because the school wanted to remove the remaining ""sinners"" (I was an atheist and it was a religious school).


Prior to this I had been in foster care and was attacked daily by my abusive foster mother that accused most of the foster children of conspiring against her while she made public grabs for attention (for being a foster parent with apparent disabled children).


I was bullied in school, held back, segregated in a classroom where I sat alone in a room by myself till the State shut the program down, brought back to normal schooling, and then segregated again due to bullying.


Eventually I was sent to a religious boarding school because my foster parents started watching crime programs and started reading biased psychology books, and got some pretty weird ideas in their heads as the attacks on the children increased:


- Teenage masterbation was a sign of psychopathy/witchcraft

- Being bullied made you a loner, and therefore a psychopath

- Same thing for being bullied by affluent teachers after they found why you were in foster care

- Rejecting religious doctrine made you a satanist/witch

- Meditation (to cope with abuse) was a type of satanism

- Being anxious around them because of their violent attacks proved disorganized thinking (and they attacked violently and humiliated you as punishment for thinking they were going to do so; catch 22)

- Being bullied for being forcibly dressed in geeky goodwill clothes meant I was trying to look ridiculous
for attention... by the people that forcibly dressed me in them.


At school I was more tormented by the staff than my peers.


There were two specific bullies (in each school), but one eventually got expelled for his behavior, and the other often joked about murdering me. He now claims he didn't remember or fabricate wild stories to justify his behavior.


Example:


When I tried to give food (from my younger, aggressive brothers stash, that he gave me a small portion) to a homeless guy outside of a bus station (going to boarding school), the bully slapped it down, and when I called him a fake Christian (main reason I was bullied was I wasn't aggressively competitive but another reason was the fact I wasn't Christian was often used as an excuse to torment me) he punched my lights out.
I walked away to the bathroom to see what the damage was.
When I came back, they were sitting with an attractive girl that asked why I was crying, he and my brother just chuckled and told her I was just a ""spazz"" and that I did it to myself. She laughed at me.


Eventually I was expelled because my younger brother was caught with a DVD containing porn (normal porn), a violation of the schools rules, and the Dean (which often harassed me and abused his powers to make my life a living hell) demanded I come to his office to answer for my crime.
He was biased towards my brother (the athlete and school bully), and even gave him the ""condo"" room while I was forced to live in the children's dorms because of my complaints of criminal bullying.


[That was a catch 22; I'm a child if I don't fight, I'm psychotic if I do?]


When I said ""possession is 9/10s of the law, why don't you punish whomever you found it on"", I was told he could punish whomever his spirit told him to.
He called in the preacher, and the two of them accused me of being suicidal because I stated that abuse of power and accusing people is what lead to my friends suicide (which I meant that *unlike* him I wasn't going to stand for it, hence why I was sitting there correcting them).
They said that after my friend committed suicide they were changing school policy so that teens with previous ""mental health problems"" and ""other sins"" would not be admitted to the school.


They locked me in the bedrest (quarantine) for three days without food, water or bathroom break, and told my parents I was caught with porn and threatened to commit suicide (really?!).


Of course no one stuck up for me, and I was told by the other teens that I did it to myself for not being Christian and not allowing people to bully me (till this day, as adults, these same people believe in extreme social segregation and order).


After that I got a job at pizza parlour and things were looking up until my younger brother showed up demanding free pizza.


He refused to leave, and then start to try coercion to get the free pizza, saying ""he won't give his own brother free pizza because he's mentally ill. He's bipolar. Fuck with him and he'll spaz on you"".


My boss told him to leave, but soon after 2 out of the 8 people I worked with started bullying me and made demands or else they would lie about me acting mentally ill.  When I refused they start sticking my day clothes in the toilet, my shoes ended up on the roof, etc.


Then I had a relationship with a co-worker that went south, and because I yelled at her at work, the police were called and I was fired (it was in an affluent area and she ran from me screaming at me also so it attracted attention).


I admit the fight was stupid, but nothing insane was said. I just said ""I can't believe I slept with this chick!"" over and over.


So while I was job hunting my landlord, who owned a slimey porn store under my apartment (the apartment my religious foster father forced me into, I didn't even have my shirt on when he pushed me in the car, screaming at me), started demanding extra cash. When I declined, he started making accusations like I was smoking in my apartment (I have never smoked and I still don't) and letting strangers in (ridiculous). Eventually he called me on the intercom, called me a smartass and told me he has a gun.



After my family refused to pick up the phone (later they would claim I never attempted to contact them), I left town. I bounced around for awhile until I met back up with one of my biological sisters.
I moved in with under the condition I got a job, which I did the same week, but a week later and she started realizing she didn't save enough and started yelling at me that I needed to get another job. I tried but managing two job calendars without transportation was hard, but before the second week was out she came at me with a knife, stating I that I told her boyfriend I wanted to ""stab"" her (I said ""slap"" her, but her BF was obsessed with interpreting everything either of us said as extremely violent because manslaughter had happened in the family; also I have a minor lisp, which is what he blamed it on, but constantly misread every other word people said as violent terms.).


Eventually she realized the mistake and tried to make amends, but at that point I was angry about my life.


So I ended up at a friends house until his girlfriend wanted to have a threesome, so I left, then circled back a year later, and found out I was being evicted without notice because my friend/landlord wanted to live with his father for a while (we had a yelling match about that, and again the police were called).
 

So that turned sour and I bounced around again until I found myself homeless in Chicago, and the police and DHS were doing ""homeless sweeps"" in the wealthier gentrifying neighborhoods; partly due to gentrification, and partly because of the then Mayors plan to ""get rid of homeless!"" campaign.


I was forced into a shelter that had us sign ""I am homeless because"" cards, and when I filled it out, my card was torn up and I was lectured, being told they only get funding if ""Mental Illness"" or ""Drugs and Alcohol"" are checked. So they redid the card themselves.


Before I knew it I was forced into their shelter-plus care program, and being told to feign all sorts of illnesses, and being sent to a sister-center that heavily relied on shelters for referrals to keep them afloat. The whole deal was what they now called ""warehouse-social services"" and ""pill-mill"" that specialized in ""bum diplomas""; meaning they get to use you for medicare/medicaid/grant claims, and they get you on SSDI/SSI and on public benefits... otherwise you get threatened with institutionalization or ""the cycle"", where the police just pick you back up and the cycle begins all over again.


When I left their sister-program (a mental health center), my abusive therapist called 911 and made a fake suicide threat, but the police that arrived didn't see what the fuss was about since I was joking around with my friends when they came in.
My SRO landlord also testified that I always seemed fine to her and that she didn't like how the social service or mental health care agencies treated me; like a piece of meat used to gain access to grants, etc.


Eventually one of the agencies got shut down and I was able to record their director of social services admitting to the ""illness claims for grants"" scam, and they let me leave without incident after I threatened to send it to the social security administration.

[Eventually she ""left"", but according to other social workers she was given the option to leave or get fired]

I fled to California, where a great deal of abused people, hoping, quite foolishly, that its was still the happy hippy land and cool bros many of us remembered seeing on TV and movies (stupid I know), thinking I could just chill there.

I had a stroke (my second), and eventually found a cool little place by the beach.

Problems started when one of my roommates lost his job three times in a row for being drunk at work.

Then he started screaming lyrics to songs at 3am on the back porch (police were called), and eventually

he started dragging in homeless tweakers to sleep on the floor or back porch for money while dragging in 
recycling cans in hopes of making rent.

Then one of my other roommates started using heroine again, and he was dragging in his druggies friends, 
eating all of my personal groceries and helping themselves to my cash savings.

One night the stress was so bad I bit down and shattered one of my teeth, and then I decided I was going to 
evict them, which went down much smoother than I though (yes yelling occurred and the police were called, but 
people actually apologized to me for the first time in my life, so score 1 point for California).


I tried to get my tooth fixed but my current public insurance didn't cover it, so I switched to one that did 
after a quick internet search.

After I went through an interview over the phone, I decided to go in for a regular check up to get a referral 
to a dentist and to see how the whole HMO thing worked, but after asking me what kind of insurance plan I had 
with them and how I got it, I ended back up in a psychiatric office speaking to another unqualified biased 
social worker.

The interview went bad because should wouldn't listen to me, and refused to help me with the dentist issues 
(even though they're an HMP and had dental program) ties.

It brought back the feelings I had when I was in the program in chicago. I couldn't get the feeling out of my 
head. So three months later I try to calm down by taking a hot shower, slip and fall (I didn't see the white 
soap in the white tub, I wear glasses but not in shower), and smacked my head.

I started seeing white flashes (""stars""?) and eventually I the pain reminded me of being beaten up in school 

and at home, and I started having flashbacks.

I called 911 asking for help due to a psychiatric emergency (which I recorded on video because I knew not to 
trust the system by this point because oversight is biased), and they laughing at me or hanging up on me after 
I said ""I'm having a psychiatric emergency"". 

This happened for three days as I sat there in pain vomiting on myself. I only had moments of consciosness, 
and my roommates were home during the periods I was awake.

Eventually the police came but told me I couldn't be taken in unless I was suicidal, which I wasn't, but it 
prompted me to immediately state I had been falsely accused of being suicidal before.

They asked for my insurance card (weird), and then they took me to the station and then the ER.

After 8-12 hours in the ER I was whisked away to a mental hospital.

I wasn't listened to, was quoted-mined, directly lied about, told I lack ADL's, insight and judgement, and 
treated inhumanely.

I was told to sign voluntary status after 3 days or else they would petition the court to keep me there, and 
so I did out of fear and confusion.

I broke down crying reporting everything my family had told me or accused me of, and I was told this was a confession. I wasn't allowed to prove to them via emails and other informaiton that there were flaws in that report. I only mentioned it because I was thinking about the abuse I suffered at home.

When I got out my roommates stated they never realized I was gone.

I tried reporting the abuses to my state appointed outpatient therapist, but she refused to make eye contact with me, refused to listen to exploitation claims, and told me foster care was the only thing to blame.
She was rather aggressive so I looked her up online afterwards and found out she didn't have a degree PsyD, but specialized in blaming foster care for PTSD.

I tried reporting the abuses I suffered during that time to both the police, the ER, my HMO and the hospital, 
but they all stuck to protecting their reputation and their members, and I was told video, witnesses and 
contradicting reports didn't matter.

During this time period I turned to REDDIT for sympathy, but everyone said I was lying, exaggerating and called me aggressive or delusional because I refused to blame myself for exploitation or abuse.

When I got so fed up I called SSA to complain (and to make other requests, which I was told I was lying about was later confirmed to be accurate) I was told I couldn't be right and something must be wrong with my head, so I told her I had recently gotten out of the hospital (stupid) and my head as fine.
So she called the police to do a checkup on me.

The police said I was fine, but decided to take me in because one of their ""guts"" told them to.
They chained me to a bench, and the ""mental health officers"" just started accusing me in super-quick succession, trying to trip me up while laughing at me. I kept a straight face and corrected them the whole time, and they just kept laughing and accusing me (totally unreal) until they took a break.
They came back and told me I was definitely suicidal, should be placed in permanent care, was a liar, a psychotic, and lying to them. They said they were going to sent me away for life.
They said I suffered from illnesses I was never even accused of, but they claimed it was on my record (lies).


I was awestruck. I asked a passing officer to speak to an admin, but the mental health officer interrupted and said we were just about to leave (we didn't leave for another 20 minutes).
The ER said they couldn't do anything, asked me if I was suicidal, I said no, but they checked ""yes"" anyway.
Finally at the mental hospital (8-12 hours later), I deny suicidal ideation, and the psychiatrist there signed me out, although the RN demanded a stay because they ""needed"" me to sure up the stats.
The psychiatrist looked confused and said I was free to go.
On the way out the RN lectured me about questioning authorities.

I was forced into outpatient care via mental health law in California, but it only included talk therapy where I as told to not make reports about abuse, and to learn how to cope with the recent abuse, and at one point I was told to see the good in abusers and exploiters (she used Adolf Hitler as an example... I have this recorded).

After another therapist told me to be complacent with abuse when it happens and to admit to everything anyone acuses me of to appease abusers in hope they would leave me alone, I left the HMO.

All complaints to the HMO, Hospitals, Police, etc... were met with doubt, then aggression.

It took me a year to have one, only one of them, to allow for HIPPA enforced corrections to my record.

The police dropped my internals affairs case and the OIG said they wen't interested.

After all of that I came back to reddit and was again lambasted, called psychotic, delusional, etc.


TL;DR Anti-suicide part

So, after being abused, bullied, exploited, lied about, victim blamed, threatened, etc... and having an completely damaged record, why I don't feel suicidal and why have I never felt suicidal?

Easy. I have a secret. It's not religious, it's not egotistical, it's not magical, it's not even special.

It's goals and it's human history.

Let me explain:

I have goals and always have. With goals, you always have a future, even in the worst case scenario,
goals are always important. Goals are part of what defines you, not just what people do to you or accuse you of.

Look, I've been through a little rough patch, baby-nonsense compared to what humans have already gone through, from jungles to deserts, to crossing deserts and mountains, through wars, and genocide, slavery, and even things like cannibalism and braving certain death in a freezing cave, humans are a lot more durable than we have been lead to believe.

Combining that knowledge, that humans are survivors, with the concept of multiple, sometimes changing goals, that is what I define as the closest thing I have to purposeful-soul, a combination of history and forward thinking powered by the knowledge that even some the biggest pigheaded egotists can change their mind, or the system would change one day... in many ways it has, and days are changing even faster.

I like to think the quicker the system messes up, the quicker it will realize it's errors.

Till then it's just a waiting game.

Right now I spend time telling the truth on internet, in hopes that the more people talk about their problems the less abuse and exploitation will be doubted. I try speaking about logic, epistemology, reason, critical thinking, evidence... in hopes one day the world be a better place so people wouldn't have to survive as I did.

I'm not claiming the world is all gold and rainbows, and I'm absolutely not claiming to be perfect as I still have PTSD episodes (I even had one today because I was told telling my story was BS).

I'm just saying hang in there, wait things out. Pick up hobbies. Maybe I'll even see you in California one day.

I have a plan about marching up and down the Golden Gate Bridge holding anti-suicide pro-social-change signs and handing out fliers, asking people not to hurt themselves, but to help change the world instead.

If there's anyone that needs to change the system it's those most effected by it that have witnessed the dirty underbelly that professionals, politicians and academics deny.

That said:

"Sad (self-harm trigger warning)I lost my closest friend in my life. He was actually online, but my mom made me delete the social contact I had with him. I don't know what to do. My mom has recently been lying to me and being rude, same with my therapist. My therapist won't give me a break, she forces me to say things I don't want to. I feel so alone, and so depressed. Everything's been downhill lately. I hurt myself. Everyone calls me an attention seeker. My parents, family, and my therapist all think it's a stage/phase and I'll get over it, that I'm too scared to cut myself or to commit suicide. But that isn't true. I just want a damn break forever. Every day I wish I was dead."

"definitely feel like ending it.i don't know what to do with myself at the moment. just thought i'd come here and get my thoughts out before i go mad.

i've been with my boyfriend for about 2 years, we met on xboxlive (we've met irl). he has multiple mental disorders like schizophrenia and bipolarism and depression. he's basically dealt with them his whole life. i have depression and severe social anxiety (i have no real life friends.) but i've only had it for about 3-4 years, though i've been cutting since i was 15 (i'm 20 he's 28) we're pretty good together, except for when it's not good. for nearly a year, he's been mentally and verbally abusing me. the most i do is tell him he's being a jackass or a jerk. he will call me a bitch, pathetic, stupid, dumb, tell me that i'm good for nothing. he's constantly dumping me for little things that can be solved just by talking or not over reacting, which has caused me to harm myself several times. he always comes back though. he says he loves me and he's sorry and changes completely. i feel like a fucking idiot for going back to him, but he's all i have and he's my only friend.

a couple days ago we had sort of a fight and he, of course, dumped me. i told myself it would be the last time and swallowed a bunch of pills and downed vodka. nothing happened. i didn't throw up i just.. sat there feeling numb and stayed awake all night. yesterday he messages me (on xbox) asking to talk about it, i wasn't in the mood and told him i was sick (because i was. from trying to kill myself). he apologized and left me alone. this morning i get another message saying he doesn't want to live life without me, but i ignored it because i'm still really fucking depressed. literally 45 minutes ago he asks to talk, and i said should we? and then he says ""oh, you're still bitchy, lol."" then proceeds to say *I* make *HIM* crazy.

i can't.. i can't take this shit anymore. i don't want to live anymore. it's like he doesn't realise he's tormenting me. i have the bottle of pills next to me and i'm ready to start, and i'm not going to stop until i pass out.

TL;DR - boyfriend is mentally tormenting me, has been for a while now, i can't handle it, want to die."
"All i needed was to have ONE, fucking ONE skill.So i could focus on it and have a normal life, have a job/career and not be this fucking waste of oxygen on planet Earth. Seriously, i simply can't fucking see my existence as something else than a fucking cruel and bad joke of the universe. You have all these people in the world and every single day i see on Reddit people with skills, like, woodworking, painting, dancing, being good with numbers, being good with people, drawing, sports. All i wanted and i needed actually, was to have ONE FUCKING SKILL IN THIS FUCKING LIFE, and i have NOTHING. I'm not even saying talent (which i think is a higher form of skill), just ONE, one fucking skill at something so i could function in this fucking life. And before you say something, i tried things to ""find"" what i could be good at or discover a skill in me, but i've found NONE, nothing that i could do or invest. 

This is pretty much the source of my depression, anxiety, my negative view of life, the lack of a skill and consequently the lack of purpose in life. I know it's wrong to judge others but it really annoys me when i see 14-15yo saying they want to die because they got rejected by someone or they think life is hard because of school, like, i'm 29 (almost 30) and i'm a fucking failure in all aspects, i have ZERO chances of changing my life because the lack of skills, the lack of good education and the bazilion mental and physical issues i have."

"YupI know I'll probably leave this life by taking my own, not sure when. But nothing is enjoyable and I'm really sad. My body and mind hurts, the only reason I've stayed is for my mom. But it doesn't seem fair to me to have to live when you really and genuinely don't want to."
"Long story short, my therapist suckedI remember this one therapist that was really bad at her job. She made me feel like shit because of what I felt and thought. A year ago, I was 100% positive there was somebody in my house. I heard noises in the middle of the night, things disappeared, I heard doors closing and opening. I know this sounds like a poltergeist, but I was certain it was someone trying to mess with me. I told my therapist about this and she basically made fun of me for thinking this. She told me that I would probably get eaten by a shark before I got murdered in my house. She was 1,000% certain there was nobody in my house. A week later she kicked me out of her office, saying she ""Didn't think she was helping me"". So I was stuck getting panic attacks and staying up all night. My feelings started mixing together, I got scared and thought that I was going to get murdered, but then I thought that I had no reason to live anyways. I kept thinking I should kill myself just so I don't have to deal with it anymore, I had nothing else to live for anyways. I remember searching up ""I think there's someone in my house"" on google and 100 results popped up. I read peoples stories about how they put up security cameras and had an escape plan if there ever was an axe murder in their house. I guess that lit a fire in me because after that I made an escape plan, took self defense lessons, bought security cameras and put a knife under my pillow. I can't help but think that if my therapist just didn't make me feel stupid I could have accomplished this sooner. Instead of insisting there was no one in my house, she could have asked what would I do if there was a person in my house, help me make an escape plan and then given me ways to cope with my anxiety. I developed trichotillomania and started cutting myself to help with my anxiety, but in return I hurt myself and my relationships. I also lost trust in people, I couldn't tell anyone what was going on because I thought they were going to act the same way my therapist did. It took me a whole year to stop thinking this way, and now I don't get as many panic attacks. 

Anyways, thanks for reading this. I just needed to vent."

"Does ODâing on Xarelto hurt?Iâm a 30 year old who just finished cancer treatment but honestly I donât have the will to keep going. My girlfriend of 10 years was going behind my back when I was in chemo and talking with some other dude. She currently has blocked my number and me on all social media. I guess weâre just over. Iâm at a pretty low point  in my life and this just adds icing to the cake. 

Iâm surrounded by shitty toxic people. My sister abuses the state for unemployment, my mom constantly bitches and my dads in Lala land. Iâm just tired of it and donât want to deal. Iâm a little upset the cancer didnât do me in. I prayed it would but my friend told me I wasnât that lucky. I have an extra goal of blood thinners from when treatment started. Do you think it would hurt? I donât have the balls to do something drastic, but i think taking the vial of pills would be easy and get the job done.

"Tired of LivingI want to overdose on sleeping pills, but Iâm not even sure what kind or how much to take for a 120lb f. It seems like the only way out.
I live in BC, Canada and all the suicide hotlines / chats only go until 1am.. which is pretty messed up in my opinion.. 
I know I probably donât even want to go through with it since I canât imagine my closest friends finding out..
But I literally just donât want to be here anymore, this may just transition into me ranting but I have a broken nose that my parents refuse to fix and it REALLY fucks up my image/confidence, I really canât stress enough how much my broken nose has fucked me up.
 I have a learning disability, itâs called auditory processing disorder so itâs not visible at all so every teacher in high school thought I was lazy and put no effort in, when in reality My brain was just SO SLOW and I canât make up ideas on my own (like starting to write a new sentence.. shit takes ages for me) I had to drop 4 courses to barely just get through senior year and Iâve done 2 summer courses.
I havenât gone to university for 2 years I personally feel like a fucking failure &amp; disappointment to my family. 
My dad is a computer software engineer &amp; my mom is a physiotherapist, they donât understand how hard it is in modern day world to get into university or get a job..
Iâm clinically depressed and have social anxiety.
My family is completely dysfunctional, Iâm very sure I was only born because my mom is pro life, my parents were supposed to divorce over a decade ago. My dad is a consistent alcoholic and all I do is argue with my crazy Irish mom constantly. 
I canât move out either because I live in fucking Vancouver where a tiny 1 bedroom apartment is 2 million dollars. My job is shit, Iâm getting totally taken advantage of, they donât give me tips, they cut me off 2 hours into shifts &amp; Iâm getting $55 paycheques. 
Iâm going nowhere in life. Iâm literally only still here because I like 3 of my friends, music &amp; my cat. "

I don't want that to happen. I don't want to die. But everywhere I turn, it seems like all I do is fuck up everything. My own mother tells me I'm useless. Almost daily. And she knows I'm suicidle. Which leads me to wonder, maybe she doesn't want me alive? It sounds so selfish, I have younger siblings that would miss me. Or at least, I hope they would. But I'm 15 and turning to alcohol for an escape.

Where the only place I know that is safe is my boyfriends arms, and that this paradise is so rarely visited. Where I don't want to jump, but the unknown at the edge of the cliff is so much more inviting, and ~~maybe the angels with soft down wings will stroke my hair while I sleep~~ forever~~ I just don't know what to do.

"Got denied entry to local university, lost my job all beofre joon today. Been drinking for 2hrsI need some help. I havent told my wife but im sure she will be disappointed. Ive been a perpetual fuck up for years. I need to let her go and be happy. What now im so lost.

I actually thought my jrcollege grades were good enough. Im such a fucking idiot and failure. I need some good advice and soon. Thank you.

edit: my wife found me in the garage and called 911. it was a half-hearted attempt and they said id be ok. they said the alcohol is what put me out and not the CO. my wife is pretty shook up and i feel worse than i did before but for a different reason. she is usually pretty strong but this shook her badly and i cant do that again knowing how it would hurt her. im getting a saline drip for the alcohol i recommend it for anyone hungover =) ive had two councilers come by and a shrink. i really hate all this attention and exposure but whatever works i guess. they told me theyd have a poor nurse watching me sleep to make sure i didnt kill myself. =( this wasnt worth it. i need to reevaluate my life. thanks for the help guys.

I'm tired of everything. Tired of nobody caring and feeling so alone and cold in this life. Tired of feeling abnormal in everything I do. I just want to quit this cruel joke called life. I want to quit the constant rejection over and over. I want to quit on a future that looks more grim and shitty than I could have ever imagined. I want to quit on hoping anything will get better, because it never does. It just gets worse. It keeps getting worse. And when there's some sliver of hope? Nope, that was just there to give you some wind so that when cold hard reality slams you back down it hurts even more.
This has been my life. Just becoming broken more and more. Every day I feel lower. And I think and say ""what if I did this"" and ""what if I did that"". And try and think of solutions... but in the end it doesn't even matter. Because nothing matters. What's the point of doing anything? I don't even know why I'm here. Why I'm alive. I'm just going to die eventually anyways. Why wait? So I can have a bunch of shitty things happen to me? So I can be depressed for another 20 odd years? So I can watch myself age into nothingness?

There is no point. There's only death. And I would rather die now. It will hurt. But it would hurt in 20 years anyways. At least now I won't have to suffer. Please God I just don't want to suffer anymore."

"I am overcome with guilt and shame and I just really need someone to talk toI saw a therapist through my school but I'm on break now and don't have access to one. Nothing in my life seems to be going right. I can't find a job and all the places I have tried don't call back. My girlfriend left me almost eight months ago now, I blame myself for why it ended and am depressed about finding someone else. I can't motivate myself to accomplish any of my goals. I am so tired of feeling terrible, worthless and incapable of fixing my situation.

What set this off was a huge mistake that I made and am feeling extremely guilty and ashamed of. Long story short: friend had a party, parents were out, I took the last two benzos I found in a drawer. I was intoxicated but I knew what I was doing, I was trying to get a high and get some relief from stress. Turns out they were the last two, parents freak out when they get home and due to the party plus the fact that the dad doesn't have his prescription, friend kicked out of the house.

I have overcome prescription abuse in the past year, so I felt absolutely terrible about going back to them, and immediately the finger gets pointed at me. I denied it to two of my friends but finally came clean to them last night. They have forgiven me and told me how much they want me to be okay, and how they are there as a support system. But I feel like a dirty thieving addict who's incapable of dealing with problems normally and has no self control. Going through medicine cabinets of my friends trying to get high makes me feel literally worthless. And now my friends know about my shameful problems.

He is not going to tell his parents it was me fortunately, but I'm not sure how much he has told them. I can't take their words of forgiveness to heart because I just want to make it right. I feel like I came such a long way in restoring my reputation. Knowing that others knew about my drug abuse, and everything that goes along with it, brings me indescribable shame. This is just dredging all those feelings back up and making me confront them all at once, and through conversations with the people that found out about it. I just need someone to talk to and some advice. My summer break has so far been a really depressing time filled with anxiety.

**tl;dr: Stressed out about everything. Stole from a friend and it came back on me. Having difficulty forgiving myself and thinking about the ramifications. Feeling desperate for something good to come into my life.**

Both of my older sisters were on antidepressants or anti anxiety medication before they moved out. I'm afraid that I might be stuck here and I'll never be able to go anywhere in my life. I can't keep myself together mentally for much longer and I don't want things to get to the point I can't fix anything. Really I just need someone to talk to.

i have the day planned when i'm going to attempt suicideaugust 19th thats when i plan to go down to the park and hang myself i don't know why i choose hanging as my method but when i think about killing myself thats what i always imagine. I'm scared and a part of me doesn't want to die but everytime i think about this life and the horrible mistake i made i don't see a point in living. I'm not leaving a note my family will know why i did it based on the date it has a special meaning for me. To be honest i don't even know if i'll actually have the courage to do it but i know i'm going to try starting next month i'm gonna start looking for the perfect tree down there and really get all my preparations in order.

"Just failed another test. Will probably fail the course, lose my scholarship, and have to drop out of school.I just failed a test I spent 20 hours studying for. This is my third failing grade in that class and I will probably fail the course now. Because of that I'll lose my academic scholarship and I can't afford to go to school without it.

I've struggled with depression for about a year now. I stopped going to counseling because I couldn't afford the sessions anymore. I haven't told anyone in my family about my grades or my depression. This grade feels like the last straw. I feel worthless- if I can't even pass a test after WEEKS of studying I don't even know if I should stay alive.

I feel like I can't talk to anyone. I just wish I was dead. I'm such an embarrassment. I think about doing it every day. It's just a matter of when I get the nerve to do it."

"Hello, folks.I've given myself an expiration date of sorts. At the end of the month, I will either start a new journey or end the current one indefinitely.

I've always (silently) struggled with mental health, even when I was a very young child. Things haven't gotten better in this respect.

We've turned life into some big ruse to find meaning in something which is void of any. It's my belief that only two things matter in this world: (1) that one feels joy in the present and the future-present and (2) nothing else. This doesn't make life meaningful, but at least the ride is worthwhile.

I've never felt joy (except those moments of unprovoked euphoria). For years I held on to the idea that I would find joy in the future-present. I've lost grip on that hope. I think continuing is futile.

But for the alternative path: I could devote myself to philanthropy. This wouldn't make life pleasant for me, but at least it will be worthwhile for others.

"I tried talking about my impending suicide, nobody seemed interested.Well... I've told my wife over and over again how terribly depressed I am, she doesn't seem to have a reaction. I told one of my ""good friends"" that I wanted to kill myself. He turned the conversation around to be about him.

"All bad choicesI know my situation isn't as bad as other's, but I'm just fucking miserable. I told myself that when I left high school I would start uni to pursue a legal career, then I got cold feet at the last minute and did nothing. That was the worst year of my life, working 2 shifty jobs that didn't respect me, one with a manager that didn't value the work I put in and another that sexually assaulted me. I took a year to work and save but all I did was work for 3 months and left never wanting to work a job again. I spent months laying inside just rotting.

Then something happened, I got some energy back, I decided I wanted to continue the legal career idea but at a smaller level, but I just did it all over again. At the last minute I got cold feet and chose no. Then a friend suggest I swap enrollment to something else and use that explore. 

I hate it. I'm 2 weeks behind because of my cold feet, I hate every piece of work in the course, and it's too late to refund the tuition I put down. I'm stuck here being miserable and I'm back to wanting to kill myself again. Why do I always dig my own pit?"

"I can't get a job, please help me! I have been applying to around 50 jobs over the last year and a half; ever since I turned 16 and got a license. Most of the time I do not hear back from the employer, and when I do I am rejected (which has only happened about twice at this point). I recently got the courage to go back to trying after the pandemic settled, and applied to around 8 jobs with a slightly improved resume and using volunteer work as ""work experience"".  Each job I apply for I adjust my resume to, which my resume includes:

\-GPA of 3.9 in High school (Honor Roll every year I have attended)

\- GPA of 3.8 in College, have been on the Dean's list every quarter I have attended (I am in a running start program, and I take college classes to complete my high school credit faster and get some free college as well)

\- Volunteer Work: Coach at Summer Volleyball Camp, worked concession stands and dances at my old middle school, and other small activities

\- Activities: Captain of School and Club volleyball teams, have played for the same team for 5 years (to show commitment)

\- Qualifications: Multi-tasking, efficient worker, adaptable, heavy lifting ability, quick learner, sociable, and many others as it depends on the job I am applying for.

&amp;#x200B;

If I am really interested in a job, I walk in and talk to the manager about my job application, and I always take my resume, which they take but never ask me to be interviewed or anything like that. I know that's supposed to be a major way to get into a job, but it has never worked for me. I always dress well and professional when I go and meet them as well.

Two of those 8 jobs I applied for I got interviews for: McDonald's and Kohl's. 

The first interview was with McDonalds, which I was very well prepared for, dressed nicely, and took it very seriously. The lady who interviewed me was incredibly rude, did not introduce herself, wrote down my answers incorrectly (for instance, when asked about my availability, I said ""I am completely available the rest of summer and into the school year, although I may need to adjust to classes but I doubt that will be the case as they are all online"", and she wrote ""available for summer""), and told me she would call me the Wednesday afterwards (it was a Sunday), which it has been several weeks and I never heard from her. I didn't want to work for someone that was that rude anyways and barely tried to make an impression herself, so I figured I would be better off searching elsewhere.

The Kohl's Job I applied for I received a email for an interview within 12 hours of submitting an application. It was a phone interview the next day, and I got a call from one of the assistant managers. The interview went fantastic. She was incredibly kind, told me that all of my answers to the situational questions were exactly what they were looking for, and we even bonded over volleyball as her kids played volleyball as well. I told her I am ENTIRELY available, every shift of the day, every day of the week and weekend, and even holidays. I told her I may need to adjust to school, and she told me that wouldn't be a problem. She treated me like we were already friends, and told me she thought our interview went excellently. I was absolutely sure I would at least get to the second interview and felt very confident that I made an impression, but to my surprise I received an email 5 hours later saying they were not longer looking at my application. I was honestly heartbroken, because I figured work experience was not going to be a problem because she stated she had 16 year-olds working there that had no experience before starting. 

I do not understand what I am doing wrong. I really need a job more than ever as my mom will be losing her job for the school year (she's a teacher's assistant), and I would really like to be able to pay for a few bills and save up for college.

Please comment with any tips or suggestions you have with getting a job, or maybe correct something I may be doing wrong!"
"I wanted to share an image.Are you afraid of what the face of suicide looks like?  Because she has won.  She has fooled you all and everyone.  How happy she looks in the photos with her then kids and husband?  How the happiest of times are captured through fishing, camping, hunting, and countless memories of the sort.  Are you distracted by all of this and more?  How cute her face is, how her smile brightens a room, or how her bright green eyes shimmer in the light?  How her life seems almost flawless, like a fairy tale but deep, deep down she has struggled to make it this far?  And then to purposely lose it all in self sabotage to finally have the courage to bite the bullet?  You'll never know.  What others are going through.  Their struggle of addiction.  Their struggle of self worth and self hatred, no matter what they are told.  No matter how much they are loved, self hate will win every time.  You'll never know how deep it is unless you're there in that deep dark hole.  Pray an angle will help pull you out.  Pray it is not too late.  Don't let the darkness consume you as it has me."

"I just want to die in peace.I hate myself.

I used to be so social and outgoing, I had confidence and lots of friends. I don't know what the fuck happened but my life just took a turn for the worse and before I could blink I was paralyzing self-conscious, my self esteem flew out the window and I became depressed. That happened when I was 11. Fucking 11-years-old. I've literally wanted to kill myself since I was 11 and if that isn't fucked up I don't know what is.

I don't have any friends at school. I have perfectly fine social skills and I have an enormous capacity to relate to people but I'm just so damn scared of rejection that the thought of saying good morning to someone is enough to send me into a panic. My dad always tells me its a hit or miss, but he doesn't seem to understand that the misses are what threaten to push me over the edge to suicide. 

I'm ugly. Absolutely fucking hideous. My dentist suggested to my mom that I get surgery to reduce my jaw because it was hindering my appearance. I used to feel pretty, sometimes, I wear makeup and do my hair as nicely as I can every day but it doesn't change the fact that I was born ugly. No one ever looks at me. No one's ever hit on me or shown interest in me. I'm just ugly.

I just turned 16 but I can't drive yet because I'm too fucking lazy and scared to get my license. I don't have a job because I can't even go into a store and buy something without panicking. I literally can't do anything.

I've been seeing a therapist for a while and she hasn't done shit for me. I go in there with an open mind hoping that she can do something for me but she doesn't tell me anything I've already heard. 

The funny thing is that I'm not even depressed. I used to be depressed, it was awful. But nowadays, more often than not I don't feel like I lack energy, I don't feel guilty, I don't feel sad. But I still acknowledge the fact that I'd much rather die than be alive because I suck and being alive sucks. My perception isn't being skewed by depression, I'm looking at this from a completely rational standpoint.

The only thing stopping me is the way my mom calls my name when she gets home from work everyday. She says it just like when I was 7 and she was waking me up for school. I'm her only child and she loves me so much and so does my dad and while I should be thankful for this I just wish they didn't because I just want to kill myself in peace.

I don't really believe that anything will get better. I don't really want to live the rest of my life being shit-faced ugly and unable to socialize because of this damn anxiety. It feels unfixable, not even my therapist knows what to do.

A while ago I realized that the only times I don't feel like dying, it's only because I manage to forget the things that make me want to die. It's all just one big lie.

There are so many other reasons why I want to die but I couldn't fit them all into a reddit post so whatever. I just wanted to get this off my chest.

The thought of dying is so comforting to me. I only wish I could do it without hurting my family in the process. "
"I think the best way to go would just be to OD on heroineIts bloodless, painless and I be happy. Ive never done heroine but ive been addicted to weed because it helped me cope. kinda fucked up that people demonize drugs and people and pay no attention to what drives them to it or give them a better way to cope or help themselves. people are so fucking stupid and hypocritical. Im done with their rules. Im done looking for help. When i read a post about someone saying goodbye, i dont feel sad, i feel happy for them. I wish them good luck. I hope they have the courage to go through with it. the only thing i look forward to is sleep because at least i have pleasant dreams. This evening i dreamt i was laying in the arms of someone i was attracted to not too long ago. In real life she rejected me. She would be crazy if she didnt. In my dream she still wasnt that into me but she let me lean back on her between her legs and i stroked her legs because they felt really smooth. I kinda knew it was a dream but i still gave myself permission to enjoy the moment. Then i wake up and realize what a stark difference reality is from the world in my head. The truth is id rather be totally lost in my head and never come out. I have nothing to look forward to in reality. Im 32 and im drowning in debt, i have no friends, i live with my parents, the last jobs i had were so depressing that i quit a year ago and havent worked since. When i go outside i feel pressure to enjoy being around people but i really hate it. I feel ashamed of my life. I just try to avoid eye contact and give away as little of myself as possible. Im not going to try anymore because ive literally been trying my whole life and nothing has worked out right. I dont want to ""get help"" because im pretty sure not even you know what that means, or what its like to look for help and become disappointed when noone is willing or able to give you the help you need. I dont want to fucking talk to anyone. I want my life fixed and no one can fix it but me and i dont even know how to fix it. Im jealous of people who  go through with suicide. It sounds pretty awesome. Its scary to you but its almost like one of the few if not only things i have control of. Fuck you for trying to make me feel ashamed for not being willing to put up with this bullshit state of consciousness anymore. I hope i at least have a nice dream before i go."

"Everything any everybody is boring. But what I canât comprehend, is not boring. Thatâs why Iâll most likely commit suicide soon
What is stopping me from committing suicide? I actually donât have any reason not to commit suicide. I should. Itâs not that Iâm scarred, or donât want to, itâs just that I havenât.

I donât want to die. I want to never have existed. There is no more reason for me to continue. People are fun sometimes but, after some time, they are boring. Iâm boring. Life is boring. I want to know if heaven or hell exist, because those donât sound boring. I want to know how much fun I can have.

There really is noting stopping me. I have nobody. They all died. Iâm not even joking. So why? Iâm looking for the answer. How to kill myself, without actually killing yourself? 

The world would be identical if I never existed, everybody who died would have died, everybody who lives would live. I am nothing, I have no purpose to anybody, and Iâm not the reason for literally anything. Youâll read this, and scroll away, and forget in about 3 minutes. Or youâll read this, message, then scroll away and forget in 5 minutes.

What Iâm saying is, can anybody find me a reason to live? Because life, is boring. And nothing is fun. People get boring, I am boring, Iâm bored. What can cure my boredom besides suicide?"
"It just seems like the right idea at the moment. I could use your kindness.Hi reddit. I've lurked a while, and things in my life have lately come to a fever pitch. I feel trapped by everything, and I don't feel like I live in a world where I'm truly free anymore. My relationships are burning me alive, and even my friendships feel porous and deceitful. I could use the kind words, cause I know there are no answers. I included my poetry, I don't know why, I guess to seem like an individual worth encouraging. I can't escape the overriding feeling that everything in my life is rotting. Thanks for your time.

I'm a well-traveled man, with a stride and a plan,

to wander less near from so far,

But nothing I will see or ever have seen,

beats back the Big Bang in my yard.

See, Williker Tidds, who lived with his kids,

was a bootlegger hot off the south,

and when prohibition brought in inhibition,

Ol' Williker whistled his mouth,

and said Jesus H Christ boy these people these people!

All looking for just a load off,

Now run back and forth and stay drunk on the sly,

While the cops, they retreat from the law,

And though the money all goes up the expenses hose,

What if one could handle the weight?

Could one make such a still that its liquor would fill

Every Sub-Mason-Dixon-Line State?

Well Jehosephat Joe I know just where to go, there's a rock that fell

out of the sky, And its shiny and hard and not an inch of its charred even though ten

foot round the brush died.

And the sound it creates when you hit it or knock it is softer than you

think it would,

And the air doesn't smell like there's burning, in fact the scent

surrounding's quite good,

But its steel-like and feels like a distant vibration, a rail for a train yet

to come, And its cold as a spring even though the damn thing is just cookin'

right there in the sun. So he brought in a team, and they all got the rock to sit stark on the

back of his trailer, And he hammered and blacksmithed and worked on great sheets of the

asteroid, thinner and paler,

And with tireless zeal and a few hurried meals, Tidds fashioned a

splendid machine,

And he stuffed it with grains and he churned up a batch that he knew

would be sweet, strong, and clean.

But when the day came to cash in on his game, Williker gasped, cause

he wasn't sure

If inside of the still, floating round in the mash, was a light, so bright

and so pure,

that a glance would set ones imagination on fire, and the soul too

would in rapture burn,

For the colors contained in that shimmer or glimmer would take a gods

mind just to learn,

And he swallowed and watched with a glow on his face, and a helpless

look right in his eyes,

He said ""Mercy, what...what is that?"" and then went inside and turned

off the light,

But at night he rest stubbornly and the thoughts in his head

Ran around in insomniac roar,

And when he sat on the edge of the foot of his bed,

The light glowed outside of his door.

With a start he stood up and ran right to his still,

which emitted a casual hum,

and the light that shot out from the top of the tank,

lit the night like a placebo sun,

And his shout was so loud that was wife, the old cow, woke and

waddled outside just to yell,

But the second she saw what dropped Willikers jaw then so too Etnas

jaw promptly fell,

For the tank had been melting for quite a long time, and the whiskey

had boiled away,

And the brand new universe just sat there, shining, at the end of its

very first day.

Theres a lot going on, in universe spawn, some things that you really

can't know,

Like the sound planets make when theyre bumping and thumping as

the galaxies they're inside grow,

And the trillion quarks, making zillions of sparks, as they bristle and

crystal-collide,

And the nebulas blooming and supernovas booming for young stars are

too doomed to die,

And just hanging in air, over two wide-eyed stares, the universe

gained dimension and size,

And its growth was quite slow,

But quite steady and so, in a year, the Tidds moved, lest they died,

For their house had been burned by a baby red giant. like a superball

coated with lava,

And their vase was erased by tiny black hole, and some meteors got

on the guavas,

And the living conditions grew dimmer and dimmer, in the town where

Williker lived,

And as land was devoured while men scattered and cowered,

People knew that something had to give,

For insurance adjusters had no clue what to write when the house was

clearly just gone,

and replaced by universe, golden and glowing, and taking more insured

houses on.

Then the government came, with their titles and names, and declared

the small town a lost cause,

And in haste the whole state had to evacuate, said the brand new ex-

states new state laws.

And for year after year the grand spectacle grew,

Until Tennessee was just an orb,

That hung twinkling high like a jewel in the sky,

Looking for a new state to absorb,

And slowly we retreat, with the back of our feet hot from The Fires of

Wondrous Creation,

But we all kinda wish that the need for the booze hadn't set up our

own immolation,

For the commune we live in at the edge of the world, while it numbers

a billion strong,

Loses faith as the land that we have slips away, and may be gone

before way too long.

But there's hope in my heart for the world and its arts, because the

future is exceedingly bright,

For inside of the Big Bang the suns live so close that their day is no

different from night,

And I'm not really scared, I'm in love with my fate, swallowed whole by

the future, constructive,

But maybe sometimes in the back of my mind i wish drinking was much

less destructive.

"Do others even care anymore?I've never been an ordinary kid as i've faced multiple occasions of physical and mental abuse growing up, so you can imagine what kind of effects that'll do to later in life. I hate being there for others and feel like i'm being fed bread crumbs and just taking the blame when things aren't my fault. I don't know what to think of myself and it's tiring to wake up another day with no hope, no future and no one to vent to without looking like an attention seeker. I'm always tempted to self harm but I just don't know what to do anymore...I just hate myself to the point where i don't really see myself anymore."

"Im sad with the lack of comunication with my girlfriend Its been 2 or so week and we only text, normaly we called everyday or everyother day, see each other on weekends but things in her life have been preventing that and im very sad as a result I hadnt realized how much I like hearing her voice. When comes to texting its distant as of late we message back and forth little bit then i send one more in the chain and 5 - 8 hour pass till i get a responce back, hell some times its untill the next day. She left small cules that its family trouble and when try to inquire,help or do something it brushed as she says i dont need to worry. Im sad as a result we text sparingly with hours in between I dont want to bring this up to because im afraid its another thing im gonna be adding on to her plate I dont know what to as my sadness seems irrational or clingy."

"How do i get my friend to open up? So I (15f) have this friend (15m) who is quite emotionally constipated due to being friends with exclusively boys his whole life (the kind of boys who don't talk)

The thing is, I'm kind of worried about him. It's nothing specific really just little things like for example, one of my other friends has a crush on him so she gave him a note telling him. It's been 4 days and he hasn't said anything to her about it, at this point it's clearly a no but he refuses to talk to her even when she asked him outright when they were alone.

I've tried to talk to him but it doesn't really work,his conversations are just so surface level. I really want to help him and give him somewhere to talk about his emotions and stuff, any advice?"
Iâm doneIdk what to say tbh lol
Anyone else not care that much about the election I'm at the point where I don't really care all that much about who wins the presidency. The choices are between an old dude and another old dude (and a woman that didn't even get to debate them).
"I can feel death on me and I'm feeling scared. I'm trying to reach out for help but nobody is answering.I can't take this feeling. I know they're not ignoring me on purpose, they're are just busy. I'm just scared atm. He told me he still loved me. I feel the tiniest bit of hope? But it's like my body is still killing me. It still hurts so much. If anything now even more. It just feels awful. Love doesn't matter in the long run and he'll probably leave again after he find someone else again. I just know deep down there's no point."

"Two years of no attempts - I feel like it's time to try againI've struggled with depression for at least the last 14 years. I first noticed I had a problem shortly after my mom remarried and my stepdad changed. When they were dating he was fun, I called him the Odie guy because when I was 3 he painted a picture of Odie just for me. He played legos with me and let me use his N64 whenever I wanted, and didn't get mad when I beat him at Mario Kart. After they got married though, he really changed. He screamed at me over everything. I have really bad ADD and struggled with doing my homework. Once I asked him how many quarts were in a gallon, and he screamed at me for an hour before giving me an answer. 

Because of him, I started cutting when I was in 8th grade. I remember being in a bad car accident with my sister and wishing that I would die in the hospital because I thought it would be better than having to go home and catch up on a weeks worth of homework. My mom seemed oblivious to it, I realize now that it was only because I never spoke up about it and he only really screamed at me when we were alone. Otherwise he would just tell me to shut up or go to my room.

I finally moved out three years ago, and he turned his aggression toward my younger sister. I feel guilty for not staying home and taking it until she was old enough to leave. Of course, that would just leave my mom alone with him. 

The first time I tried to kill myself I was 17 and I left home to drive off a bridge. I took some painkillers and started driving toward the river. My dad called me on my cell about a half mile from the bridge and asked if I wanted to go into Battle Creek with him to see my stepbrother, at 11 PM. He's always been close to me and he said he just had a bad feeling and wanted to see me ASAP. I ended up throwing up and stayed with him most of the night before I went home.

After I moved out, I brought my boyfriend up to live with me. It wasn't the best situation, because he had some of the same bad habits as my stepdad. Namely, he screams at me. He hasn't hit me, he's pushed me a few times to get me away from him but so far it's only been emotional abuse. 

After I started cutting again, I went to my doctor and asked for help. I didn't want to take pills because they mess with my head and I knew they would be bad for me. Well, they had me take them anyway. After a week on the happy stuff, I started hallucinating at night and having horrifying anxiety attacks. I called my doctor but the emergency line they gave me had no answer, so I called the ER and they told me to stop taking the pills and see my doctor as soon as I could. 

Two days later I locked myself in the bathroom and bashed my head against the toilet until I started to bleed. My boyfriend called an ambulance and they hospitalized me. A few weeks of therapy and I've been a good girl since. I haven't tried to hit myself, cut, or take more than my prescribed dose of painkillers.

I have fibromyalgia in addition to the depression and anxiety. It's extremely painful but I live with it every day and I try to not let it get in the way. Stress can make the pain flare up more, so my boyfriend asked me to quit my job at Subway and stay home. The agreement was that I would cook, clean, and manage the apartment. Housewifey sort of deal. But I enjoy that. I don't mind cleaning, I LOVE cooking, and it lets me work from home. Lately though, he's changed his mind. He's started screaming at me again whenever I ask about starting a savings account, or asking him to stop buying me things I don't want/need. He's become abusive again and I can't let it continue this time.

But I have nowhere to go. I can't leave, my Mom won't take me and my Dad can't take me. I could ask my Aunt in Florida, but she just went through a divorce and there's no way she could afford to let me stay with her and my two nieces. All of my friends still live with their parents, and they're worse at finances than my boyfriend is. I have no safety net since he took all of the money I did have saved so he could buy groceries after he overdrafted and his bank charged him about $120 in fees.

I love my family, and I love my cat (his name is Gandalf). But just ending it seems better and better every passing day. My family will get over it eventually, and it's not like my boyfriend is going to miss me. I'll just be a story for him to tell later. And my roommate adores Gandalf so I don't have to worry about him having to go to a shelter or something. But the pain I go through every day, from my heart being stomped on to my spine feeling like it's being ripped out every time I move... It's too much for me to handle. I've already boxed up all of my crap to donate, and written my notes. 

I haven't decided how I'll do it yet, the river is only a few blocks over, I live on the 3rd floor, I have knives and pills and so many other things at my disposal. I know I'm probably being selfish but right now I just don't care. "

"Family problems, depression leading to toxicity and gf considering a breakupI started to write down the story of my suffering as whole, but I ended up with 20.000 characters, so I will try to make it as short as possible.

I am a 22 year student, who has family problems and a gf whom he can't make happy anymore. My family problems are beyond unfixable and I struggle to deal with that. I am currently living with my gf and she is considering a (temporary) breakup until I can tie myself together. I have become anxious, nervous, angry and toxic over the last year, as I couldn't handle my family and it's problems. Life with my gf is perfect, she is the one, but I can't enjoy anything anymore and this further bothers me. It bothers me so much that I sink into my pc and play a lot of games, not particularly one, but several. Distraction is apparently my drive. But I don't want to be toxic to my beloved aswell, so I try to keep my shit for myself, but imaginably this isn't very good for our relation.
I don't get anything done and procrastinate a lot. I haven't been out with friends for 2 months or so, only for groceries, occasional walks or visiting my sick dad in hospital who had half his intestines removed because of an infection. There I get to hear shit like she'd leave me and it drives me crazy, he won't ever take me serious.
it seems like nothing is going my way in my life, except meeting my gf, but I can't be happy anymore and I think I am bad for her. I want her to be happy and I think maybe it's for the better if she just left. Then again, I have no interest in my family, very few friends and no real hobby or career desire. My hobby used to be gaming, specifically counterstrike, that's waht I kept telling myself until recently I started to realize it was only a distraction my entire life. An illusion, a compensation, worthless skills thrown away, hours of wasted time going down the drain before my eyes. As for the career part, I wanted to go into video games industry, but I don't know, it feels pointless to me now.

So yeah, if my gf leaves, that's it, I have literally nothing to live for and nobody to live with. I have thrown away everything else and I'm losing her because of this. I just don't want to face my problems. I know I'm a coward. But once I can make that step it won't matter anymore. Maybe someone has to say something to this. I am just tired, tired of all this shit. Why live, for what?

"I'm the happiest I've been in a long time, but I still feel trapped.I'm happy. 

I have been suicide sober for a year since this August and I'm quite proud of myself. Depression hasn't been won over, but I'm managing to be quite happy throughout most of my days. There was actually a night a month or so ago where it was hard to sleep because I was so happy. It's a totally alien feeling after suffering for so long. 

But sometimes...Doing it now feels like it would be more viable than doing so back then. I feel like I could actually pull it off. 

Reason being is I still feel trapped. I've been trying to find part-time work for a little bit and have gotten a few interviews, which is nice. My sibling and I have been applying for awhile now, but problem is when some people make it seem as if you aren't doing anything, or have to do it *their* way. Well, I have multiple confirmation emails and interviews as proof that that isn't the case. They make it seem like I don't want to work, when I've explain multiple times it isn't about not working. I just don't want to end up being one of those people becoming complacent with where they are and not striving for more. I don't want to be one of those people whose job is sapping their life-force and become crestfallen. That would be counterproductive to keeping my mental health where it's at now. 

If I'm not striving to make my passion a reality then what's the point? So I can be like them and realize that work makes me miserable and not continue to search for something more? I think, I'd just use that money to buy myself a ticket out of here. That was one of my plans. 

Someone thinks I need to do full-time, but part-time would allow me to get work experience while also have adequate time to work on what I actually need to be working on. I just don't want to be trapped working for someone when I know I could be doing something better. That's different from not working or not wanting to work at all. I'd rather die than let that happen. I'm just getting tired of it. Just because you have a job doesn't mean you're going anywhere if you're working places for years on end without making your goals happen. 

Honestly, I don't believe I deserve to live, or kindness. I don't know why anyone thinks I'm some angel or whatever. I ain't. I have this rage pent up in me and I think evil thoughts. They know this, yet continue with the platitudes. I'm happy, but I think it's best I see my way out. 

People say there is some fucking ripple effect when we commit suicide? I mean, sure, but it won't be anything significant, I don't believe. 

I don't know... There is a nice lake I can walk to, by some pretty neighborhoods. That would be nice for some of my last sites. 

I guess that's all hypothetical. I'd love to keep going, but I'm tired of being jobless and being made to feel as if I'm not looking, or being expected to work them instead of following my passions. Stupid. 

I'm currently writing a book. It's in its final stages. Once its all done, that would be a good time to go. 

But again hypothetically speaking."

I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about this.

And the one person that could make things better wonât even try to be there for me at all and it makes me really sad because I thought I meant enough to them for that.. everyone I know will tell me things and then just leave me alone and expect me to be able to do them when Iâm at my lowest.

"Please help, I'm worried for my friendI just posted this in r/depression as well. I'm sorry if this is against the rules. I'm putting it out there in whatever subreddit I think might be able to offer advice.
Hi, My friend has depression. It's severe. He's medicated. He's in therapy. It isn't enough. I understand I can't make him happy (I'm diagnosed bipolar; there is no risk of my telling him to ""cheer up"".). I can't make the depression go away. But at least I feel I can make his day easier on him. In the past, we've been ""romantically"" (I say that to represent my end, he identifies as aromantic, but does still care for me.) involved in the past and recently split up (lack of compatibility at the time), but still care for one another. From his blog, I know he feels lonely, isolated, unworthy, useless. He wants affection and attention but doesn't feel he deserves it. At least once a week, often more, he posts about thoughts of suicide, and I'm so scared he will. For the last three or four weeks (with explicit permission) I have been bringing him a note, a small gift of some kind, every morning to try and remind him about the people who care about him, who think he's worth existing. I spend time with him during the day when I can, I've told him my phone line's always open if he needs anything. I try and remind him to eat, bring him foods he likes. I've told him nothing but the truth, I've kept all the promises I make him, I give him space when he says he needs it, said that it's okay whether he wants to talk or stay quiet. Cuddled with him. I've tried to do everything I felt I needed when I was severely depressed, tempered by what I know about him. I'm so worried. Sometimes it seems like the more I try to be there for him, the less he feels he's worth it. I don't want him to kill himself and I'm scared that he might. What can I do? Please help."

"My never ending struggle.This isn't the first time I've reached out to Reddit to try to catch me from falling, but the last time only seemed to help for a little while, then made things worse. It's like drugs now that I think about it.

This is my first ever post here, and throwaway for obvious reasons, I have friends who browse Reddit and I would never want them to see something like this. I don't want to add extra people to my struggle, which is why I don't see a doctor or call a hotline. It's something about the internet that makes me feel better about being able to vent my issues out.

First off, I have had a history with drugs, I won't go into detail here, but it was rough and I've moved on since. The only drugs I consume now is Alcohol every once in a while and the suspense of watching more internet videos until it's 4 a.m. and I can barely walk to my bed. This brings me to my next issue. I'm not malnourished, in fact I eat a lot. I'm not fat, I'm actually slightly underweight. No matter what I eat or drink, I always feel out of energy though. I'll go to the microwave to heat up a Hot Pocket and I'll have to sit down instead of being able to stand up for the 2 minutes it takes to heat the damn thing up. I feel like it's a symptom of depression but I'm not sure. In fact I think one of the reasons I haven't ended it is that I'm too lazy to do so.

My next issue is that I've never been good at coping with stress. I used to use drugs to do it, but as I've mentioned I don't anymore. I tried meditation, but while it clears my mind for a certain period of time, it doesn't last forever. Now I'm lost when I need my relief mechanisms the most. I'm at the cross-road in my life where I have to make life decisions fast and I have to hope that the decisions I make are the right ones for me financially, mentally, and physically. I feel like this decision is a triangle where I can only pick 2 and have to leave the other one behind. I don't want to make this decision, I would rather end it and hope that what I've learned on Earth is really what happens when I die. The idea of everything fading to black, my thoughts, my feelings, my struggle, all being gone. I know these thoughts aren't healthy, I know it isn't right, but I can't fix it.

I've heard many people call suicide selfish and things like that, and I feel like I'm the textbook definition of it. I have a bright future ahead of me if I dig myself out of the hole. I'm one of the really smart kids in my school, my school reached out to me personally to tell me they wanted me in AP classes, I have friends, I've never really been popular with the opposite gender but that's fine to me, I have a family that supports me, I have a hobby that I love, but for some reason I want to end my life. I want to throw away my life like it's the Reddit account I'm using to post this. Perhaps I am greedy, but what does that solve? It doesn't erase the feeling, it doesn't make me feel better, in fact it only makes things worse. Not only do I want to kill myself, but now the people who think of me when I'm gone are going to think of me as greedy? Fuck.

If you're reading this, I'm sorry I made you read this. I'm a lunatic, even more so at 3 a.m. I'm sorry I brought you into this, but I'm lost. I don't know how to feel about this feeling other than wanting it gone, while simultaneously feeding it. I never thought that I would be doing this or thinking this, I always thought that I would be the one giving the advice. I guess depression gets everyone. I'll try to respond to these comments before I sleep.

"I really feel like this is it.Every time it seems like I post-pone these thoughts and suicide altogether, but the way everything has been going I'm not sure I can go on anymore. Like, I'm posting on this sub, this is my last attempt at trying to live at all. It's pathetic of me to ask strangers on the internet to give me reasons to live, but that's where I'm at. I feel like people will only like or talk to me, because they think if they don't then I'm gonna kill myself. I don't want to live like that either, that seems unfair to them."
"A Quick rant  So My friends became very toxic lately, It started like 6 months ago, when started reporting, insulting, enemy players and calling them hackers, Just because they killed him, at first I tried to ignore that, but, he started being even more toxic, and my other friend also started being like that, when we are playing with random people, one of them insults, and calls people noob, because they did something wrong, and votes to kick them, which usually Ends up with huge argument, and this can really destroy a good match, The other Just makes annoying sounds to the mic, but also insults others, today, I tried to tell them, that It's bad, but they ignored it, and also, we are also not the Best players, we all have the lowest ranks, and we play with people with the lowest ranks, so they mÄkÄ mistakes, but they laugh it off, I'm so Dissapointed in them, what do you think?

"Why I Want To DieI'm inferior. I'm inferior in every possible way. It pisses me off. The only reason I'm still here is because I don't want to kill my family by killing myself.

I come from a family of seven. I have four siblings. The oldest can play every instrument. The second oldest is a model. The second youngest is a fucking genius. The youngest is good at every single thing imaginable.

I'm there. I'm somewhere in the middle there, overshadowed by all of them.

I love them to death, but they make me really see how awful I am.

I'm 17 and am dying from loneliness. I don't understand socialization. It doesn't make any sense how people make friends. It drives me sort of crazy, too, because I can never really tell who is my friend and who isn't. You never know what someone is actually thinking, right? Just the other day, I asked a ""friend"" if I could take pictures with them for an upcoming school dance. I never got a response. Even a no would have been better. Maybe they didn't respond because they don't like me. Maybe they didn't respond because I'm a fucking goody-two-shoes.

I desperately wish I wasn't so good. What I wouldn't give to be dumb drunk. I've drank a few times but not enough to get me drunk. I'm afraid of being caught by my parents. I just want to wipe out all of my thinking with alcohol. I don't want to think. My brain is my biggest enemy.

I approach everything with a paranoid sense of what people are doing. I approach everything completely overthinking and over-hoping that it will be the thing that makes me better.

I've had crushes in the past, but you know, it's school. When you tell one person, everyone finds out. That's why I've delved into secrecy. Bottling up every single feeling I have for everything. I couldn't with my last crush, though. I've liked her for a year, and she is a big reason why I want to die. She always acted friendly towards me and nice, but like I said before, I am paranoid. I decided to actually pursue this crush, something I haven't done in about 4 years. Well, she eventually said to her friends that she thinks I may be obsessed with her. I don't fucking understand social interactions, let alone dating, especially in high school. Not many people know about my crush for her, but I can't get over her. I just want her, even if she has a boyfriend, which is something I found out a week ago. I think he's a new boyfriend, though. She still treats me like a friend, and by not talking to her much, I guess she started thinking I'm not obsessed with her. I don't care. I think I kind of am, but that's not something anyone can know. Only something I keep wrapped up to myself.

I keep other things wrapped up to myself. I'm a poet, with a skill for math. I've won a national contest for poetry, and I'm part of an international math challenge. Of course though, I'm going to college for engineering. Yeah, it sounds like I'll make a lot of money, but I hate it. I want to pursue the arts. Math isn't fun. Math is predictable. I love the unpredictable. I would love to start my career by doing stand-up. The people who I think are my friends always tell me I'm very funny, but they don't even know about my stand-up aspirations. I really only have these dreams because they are an outlet for my depression. They make me feel like people would appreciate me, but no one ever will because I'll probably never gain the balls to stray from engineering, a sure thing, to actually go towards something that I will enjoy.

I still don't see myself as intelligent. In fact, I'm the dumbest thing on the face of the Earth. Just look at my family. They're all gifted in something, even the model one is, too. They're all brilliant in their own way. I'm just there. In my family, I'm known for being the klutz.

I just want to die. Get me out of this world, or at least give me enough alcohol that I will be numb. Please. Thank you for reading my rant. I doubt anyone will even read all of it."

"I can never commit to anything in lifeRelationships, school, personal things I once enjoyed doing. I just can't bring myself to do anything long term. Everything seems meaningless and why not get it over with if it's inevitable"
"Losing itSo I've been getting this thoughts where I want to kill someone ( one person specifically). I'm fucked up in the head and I know, this is not me anymore but I can't help it. So now I don't only get thoughts about killing myself but also wanna hurt someone else. 
I see it as a way to take it all out on someone for all the misery I'm going through. In my head I see myself stabbing him and then probably killing myself right after. Or maybe not. But yeah somehow this thought brings some kind of relieve if it's only temporary. Please don't be scared of me, I'm not a bad person but I'm not the same anymore so yeah. "
"They got the school involvedI don't know how long this is I'm writing this from art class at school. I don't really know what I should do with myself. My parents don't really want to take me to a doctor, they say there's no way I can be depressed I have too good of a life. 2 weeks ago I kinda had a really bad breakdown and I cut myself from where a t-shirt ends on your arm all the way up to my shoulder and I told my best friend about what I was doing because she keeps telling me that when I do something like that I need to tell her so she can talk to me out of hurting myself more. So I told her and the conversation was very slow, with her only responding like every 20 minutes. Eventually I calmed down enough to go to bed and so the next morning I go to school and it's fairly normal, except at the end of English I get called down to the councelor. She reported me to the school councelor telling them that I self harm and that I'm suicidal. Which I do want to kill myself but that's planned for March I have a long time for things to change. I got called down to the councelor 3 times that week And of course I denied everything to the councelor I don't want the school involved. After I got out of that I found out my friend had a panic attack because I told her and I feel so bad it's all my fault I knew I shouldn't have told her I can't believe I put her through that. I'm a terrible person. Last week and this week I've been wondering about going to the school councelor and just telling them everything to make my friend happy but at the same time I could just move my suicide day closer too. I've taken care of all my loose ends already so I can if I need too. But everyday at school I keep telling my friend today's the day I'm gonna go to the councelor when I know I'm not going and it makes me feel really guilty and I think I'm gonna genuinely go there at somepoint today if the councelor is there. I really just wish I didn't exist, not to die but to just not be a part of anything. thanks for listening, hopefully if I go to the councelor I don't have anything too bad happen."
"Some people tell me I should commit suicideIt happened years ago. I sat on a bus with to the opposite of me a man and a woman. They were talking about the lessons they were making. At one point I think the woman referenced that she had a bad childhood. I said in myself rather loudly that it was a Freudian excuse. After that the woman asked me if I was German and started unironically comparing me to Hitler. After I apologized and started saying that I was suicidal she told me that she would be quite happy if I commited suicide. Now, to be fair, the man next to her even said that it's rare for someone to apologize and that I shouldn't listen to her, but it still stuck out to me in my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today. I told on a website that I consider myself to be a pedophile and said if I should commit suicide based on that fact alone. Someone responded by saying yes. After it I decided that I should commit suicide after I discussed it with my parents. After affirming to them that I didn't watch child porn nor raped a child but affirming that I do have pedophilic fantasies they told me that I should call the suicide hotline and that they'd discuss this with my psychiatrist. After it I agreed with them that the reason I thought about suicide is because I was due to fear of failure. I am afraid to fail and prefer to kill myself rather than to anticipate failure. I tried jumping out of a window when I was in 4th grade at high school because I failed to form a group with someone. I tried killing myself with a knife because I failed to keep my dad happy etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Still though. I now know of two people who've told me to kill myself. I really don't know what to do now. Yes, my parents and teachers want me to keep on living, but since I have seen two people who without any sense of irony told me to kill myself I'm confused on what to do now. "

"What is that feeling when you feel like you are jumping out of your skin?Has anyone else experienced this? It's like a periodic combination of a cringe, electric shock and a chill. It happens every few seconds. It mostly happens when I get insomnia, but it can also happen for no apparent reason. I also feel hot and cold at the same time. I have been to the doctor and they look at me like I am an idiot when I describe this  sensation.  

When it comes it is pure hell. Does anyone have any  idea what this is and how to fix it?"

"33 and deeply suicidalSo, I'm 33 and, for easily the past 15 years, I've seen no worth in getting up in the morning. I started fantasizing about killing myself when I was ten years old. I'd walk around the elementary school where my mom works and imagine people finding me in different closets or alcoves. I was home schooled and didn't have any friends for most of my teenage life. Between the ages of 15 and 23, I literally didn't see anyone of my own age for months on end. I felt incredibly isolated, lost, scared, and worthless. I thought of suicide every day. 

In the past 23 years I've been in tons of therapy programs and have tried incredibly hard to grow myself as a person. I've tried to grow and learn to make friends. Every step of the way has been a struggle. I had to practice making eye contact, then practice shaking hands, then practice hugging, etc. I didn't have my first girlfriend until I was 27, my first job until I was 28, or get my driver's license until I was 29. 

I've never had sex or even done much beyond kissing with a girl. I'm afraid because I don't know what I'm doing. I grew up around women and I am afraid of disappointing them or making them feel pressured or uncomfortable. The women I'm drawn to are almost always conservative sexually, but eventually I know I have to be capable of living up to their expectations. When you're in your thirties, that's intimidating. 

Last year I fell in love with a women I worked with. I quit my job to be with her. We dated for six months and she broke up with me because I lost my job. I'm still jobless, almost three months later. I was in a car accident and have no car. I have rheumatoid arthritis and can't afford my medicine, so it's hard for me to walk or do any exercise. 

My girlfriend and I planned for a summer filled with trips and time together and instead I spent my summer alone, bedridden, broke, heartbroken and desperate. 

 Nothing makes me happy and I have no one who loves me or wants to truly be with me. I've been in a combined 9 months of romantic relationships over the course of my entire life and both women left me and broke my heart. I have a master's degree but can never find a job that pays me a living wage. I'm in constant pain and my every waking moment is consumed by missing what I've lost. I feel like a hollow, immaterial thing. Like I'm already lost and exist in remnants only, like I'm light and insignificant enough to float away without detection. 

I genuinely feel like there's no point in going on. I've tried to kill myself twice before, with the most recent time being this time last year. That time, I ended up in the hospital and almost passed away. In each situation I felt overwhelmed to the point of panic. Suicide felt like something that was a solution to temporary lack of reason. 

Now I have a very logical, almost calming belief that there's really no point to going on. It's like the thought of quitting a bad job or anticipating the end of a bad experience. I intellectually believe that life - at least the one I have - is not worth living. 

I miss my girlfriend desperately. I gave up everything for her. She had issues too, and I gave everything I could to trying to help her, understand her and be there for her, even though it sometimes resulted in me feeling hurt, overlooked, and ignored. I believed in her, beyond any of her issues, but she didn't even believe in me beyond my current employment options. 

I can't do any better and I can't do any more. Every day when I go to sleep I plan to end my life the next day. It's the most encouraging thought I have as I drift off. I just needed to share. "

"I lost my 4 year old Minecraft world Iâve been playing Minecraft for years. Itâs a huge part of my childhood. I remember how excited I was when horses were added. Iâve made a lot of friends on there and itâs a different pain knowing Iâll never play with them again because of my older sister who used to find my best worlds and delete them. 
I made a world in 2016. I spawned on an island. I made a hotel so high it reached the limit. I had hundreds of massive houses all in a line with backyards. I improved the village. I added public bathrooms with working toilets. I made colourful,unique buildings and they were stores or cafes or pubs or orphanages,pools,fisherman places,a school,Aquariums,hospitals,police stations with German Shepard, I had cat/dog/ferret/hamster/parakeet and parrot cafes. Adoption centers,customized banners with countries,lgbt flags,a zoo, large bridges that lead to the ice biome so you could look above the polar bears. Farms that were huge. A witch castle. An ikea with furniture. I made my own texture pack and it was beautiful.

So when I got kicked off and went back on,only to find myself in survival,my inventory empty and in the middle of the ocean, I felt awful.

I had a graveyard with the names of my old Minecraft friends so Iâd never forget them,since I have severe memory issues. A huge piece of my childhood just got ripped out. I got attached to that world. I had a section dedicated to little memories of my childhood. I made it because Iâve forgotten my whole childhood except for the bad things so I made the section because then at least Iâd be able to remember some of it.

And Iâve lost it all"

"Non urgent, just need to rant a little to strangers.After 'Redditing' for almost 3 years on my main, I've decided to fianlly create the first 'other account'.

I'll say this early to discourage time wasting, I'm not suicidal, I'm not so sure I ever was.

I haven't shared all of this to anyone, so I'm sorry if this rants on for a little while, but this is the first time I've shared myself fully with people... Whether they know me or not.

I had a good childhood. Great infact, parents weren't that well off, but food was always in for me and my 2 sisters and our family is one big happy family (as far as families go).

I'm the second born, only male in the family.

I've always been second best to the older sister. From when we both got our first jobs, I was paying more towards the family upkep than her (due to the parents being afraid to confront her, this was confirmed by relatives), I was paying around Â£150 a month for upkeep, she was less than Â£80. 

This evened off after a couple of months once other family found out. I wasn't particularly bothered at the time, my spare wages went on nights out and other stuff that would never last... Hers too, but it never affected her job.

I worked for 5 years for the NHS. They screwed me over, I was harassed at work for apparently sleeping with the bosses helping hand. That wasn't true, nothing happened and nothing would (her 17 year old daughter made a pass at me one time, I turned her down, I had a girlfriend at the time).

I'm not sure how much of this is relevant. That girlfriend up there though ^, she was a compulsive cheat. My first steady girlfriend, forgave her the first 2 times she cheated on me... The usual first 'love'.

I should mention that before the NHS work I went to a college to increase my English and Maths GCSE (Our class got screwed over with 6+ teachers in highschool during the exam term). I wanted the grades and so went back to college to try and achieve them. 

College wasn't for me. I knew from the very beginning how I could increase my exam grade and didn't want to sit through one more year of classes. 

I tried. I tried for the first couple of months of classes before I was fed up of being taught the exact same material for yet another year because of the failure of our highschool by assigning us physical education teachers to teach us maths and english during their time off.

So I skipped classes. The only class I did attend was the Computing class.

To cut that story short, I was caught frauding EMA (Educational Maintenance Allowance... You got Â£30 a week if you attended all of your classes).

I didn't get the Â£30 a week, as I didn't attend all of my classes. At that point my parents were on my back, big time.

So I forged a copy of a fake form that was titled ""**** (I knew there was a good reason for proof reading - name deleted) has attended class this week""... I attended all of my classes for one week and the teachers signed it.

Once they did, I doctored the form and made it so they were signing to declare my presence in  all classes.

You can probably see where this is going... It failed. My father and I were called into a meeting with the heads of the college. One of my tutors was called in and that was that. My father went ape shit. Told me he was driving home and he wanted me to quit college that day.

I overdosed the next morning without quitting college. I took many, many pills that morning (I can't even remember which pills, I just remember having around 30 of them lined up).

I didn't feel bad at all, I felt like I was releasing this massive build up of stress that I never learned how to let go of. 

I feel I should add that I still haven't learnt how to handle stress. I don't even remember the last time I bothered about anything. People always comment to me that I walk like I don't have a care in the world, and I honestly feel like they're right, not only do I not have a care in the world, I don't think I care about anything, and yet people see this as a trait, it's not. 

That lack of caring is what has bothered me the most in my life. It's not that I'm an arsehole with it mind. I have and always will disregard my own consequences if it means that another person will lose some of their own stress. 

Take tomorrow (well... It's 3am, today I should say). I'm moving house today. I have around Â£40 in my pocket. I have to pay up Â£200 by the end of the day in order for us to get the keys... Oh, and we get kicked out of this current home at 5pm today, regardless of having another house or not.

Most people would plan their money a few days in advance. I only just managed to sort mine out a few hours ago. In fact, I'm not sure I have it all sorted out, I think I may be Â£70ish short, but no worries, everything always works out.

I'm not sure where I'm going with this, I think I just needed to put everything in perspective. 

This is where I could go with this... Does everyone feel this way? Even with past relationships, I've always been told to share my feelings more.... I've had 4 long term relationships (well... over one year each)... I've never been a sharer of feelings I guess (should I note that each of those long terms got engaged to the next man they met? Each of them were less than 6 months of knowing them?)

I've given up on relationships for now. I've been single for around 6 months (the longest in 8 years)... Never had a one night stand, I'm all about meaningful things in my head, just not in person.

I guess this has gone on for a little too long... I don't expect anyone to read this far down, except maybe myself later on. I guess we all need ways of relieving stress, writing it down might be one of mine, I'll see in time."

it's Currently midnight and I can't go to sleep because I'm only having recurring thoughts of suicide and how I will basically pull out my dad's gun from his closet and have my last words and shoot myself blah blah blah. I've been suicidal many times before and have come inches to death but I'm scared for tomorrow because me being me I might just actually go and do it. To be honest I also don't want to keep pretending that I'm just suicidal by not pulling through sadly that's just my stupid fucking personality and won't change. There's plenty of things wrong with me and lets just say me and parents don't get along very well and I'm 18 doing online classes for pre-med still living with them. Every single  time I chat with them whether it be at the dinner table or elsewhere we will argue and it's gotten to the point where I won't talk to any of them. Believe it or not I never used to be like this at all but the more I began to notice how unbelievably petty my mom is to every little thing the more we didn't get along. This women who I still somehow have my utmost respect for will get scrawny about money and her communism agenda in her house it insane. For example I will use her outlet to charge my phone and she'll bring it up in an argument and tell me stop disrespecting her. Of course it's nothing like that though she will immediately berate me. This shits crazy and fucked man I want to get my own life started for me so I can say that I own my stuff for myself but it's nearly impossible in this epidemic. I don't want to sound like that person who says they're funny or playful when they're not but allow it this once because I am a genuinely whole different person outside of my family, it's like a different reality. Oh shit I almost forgot don't get me started on my dad! what the fuck man!

TLDR; I'm a selfish motherfucker who wants to kill himself because he just realized that he is selfish prick /s, I think?. Oh god please help me. Shits crazy I'm not even white, if a white mofo lived with my family it'd be like applying to be a school shooter. All jokes aside please help!"
Feeling really close to the end.The biggest thing that's stopping me is knowing how depressed my dog would be with losing me. Other than that I could care less about anything. 2 years ago I had everything I wanted. I moved because of a Hurricane. I had a job I really liked and lost it.  My roommate who was helping me get back on my feet passed right before Christmas. I don't have a car. I don't have a job. And I'm in a town where I don't have any friends or anyone. My mom doesn't want me back home because she likes to choose her boyfriends over me.  I have 1.37 in my account. I've already sold most things. All my bills are behind and I have no other options right now. I'm borderline homeless again. Except this time I don't even have a vehicle to sleep in. I have meds I have rope and other things. It wouldn't be hard for me to do. I'm very ready to end it. Maybe some people here can encourage me not to.

"Snapchat sometimes sucks Almost everytime I ask someone to snap they wont snap BUT when they ask me to snap I ask again will they snapback and they dont reply. I don't understand these people, they literally ask for it then they don't reply. Can somebody tell me why?"
"I'm back home... now what?I went to Poland 10 months ago to change my life. Partially because I thought where I lived and went to school was boring, partially because I thought I might get better there.

I got back home on Tuesday. After being sick from probably catching something off the plane, I'm well physically, but... apathetic. Sad and lonely.

None of my friends know I'm home yet. Don't really know if they are friends. People I used to go to High School with over two years ago? More that than anything else. I don't really want to tell them either.

My family is great, I'm glad to be back,  but... well, my brother doesn't like to do stuff with his sister. My mother and grandmother can only so much be my friends. Dad's a truck-driver, so he's not home at the moment. My dog doesn't even like me that much.

Some of my OCD issues are coming back. I was OK in Poland for the most part, but home with a dog (that prefers my grandmother, which makes me sad actually. He's supposed to be my dog, but... :/ I used to play with him, but since the OCD I can't really pet him that much even) I'm starting to wash my hands more.

Poland didn't work, coming back isn't working. I can't go back to school until summer at earliest and it'll probably end up being the fall semester anyway.

Also haven't spoken to my long-distance fiancÃ© in a few days. Not properly for a few weeks, even. He actually has school and a job, and I do barely anything.

I still feel so lonely, but I don't even know if I want to be near people.

SW has been coming up on my main page all day, and I can sincerely tell everyone that they're worth it and good and should try to fix things, but when *I* think about it... I don't see a reason for me."
Anybody down to talk? I will talk to anybody so dm me if you are interested
"I've been getting suicidal texts from someoneI really want to help this person out. I talked with this person online and in the beginning it was cool, we had fun talking. They were funny, and made jokes. However now they come and tell me things like, ""I want to die"", ""If I killed myself it would be good"", etc. 

And now I'm scared. I asked them if they were joking (probably a horrible choice on my part), but they replied they not.

I.. am at a loss. I don't know how I can support them. Also, a last text they sent me was alarming. 

""No, but it doesn't matter"" This was after they responded to me asking if they were joking.

What can I do to help?"

I've been contemplating ending itI'm a 15 yo male I recently broke up with me girl friend of two years and I miss her but I feel like I screwed things up to badly I used to be suicidal before when I was living with my abusive father the only thing that stopped me from kms back then was my friend group I'm still friends with them but at this point telling them how I feel isn't helping at all I feel constantly tired and I'll feel like crying but my body just holds back all my emotions and nothing's helped and at this point I feel lost and my parents keep stressing me out over school and I'm doing good at that and everything just feels like it's crumbling down around me and I just feel like everyone would be happier if I was just off this Earth
"Sister has tried to kill herself three times now that I know of, I just don't know what to do.The first time she tried I was away at university, it was a secret kept from me for over a month and it tore me up that I didn't even know until my family told me, late.

Fast forward a year and now I'm home, she tried again this Sunday when I was over at my girlfriend's and I just didn't know what to do. We hadn't spoken in a while and I didn't know she was upset.

Yesterday night my parents went out 'for a trip' when I was with some friends, she had done it again. I have no idea what to do.

At this point it seems like if we've had 2 days of good positive steps for her to regress back to this then she's lost. I am feeling so jaded from this, I don't know what to do. She's been in hospital all day today and I just don't know what to do.It's all to do with a jerky guy that has moved on from her, she's had bad relationships before and he was equally as bad a person, manipulative and nasty. But since this time we went out for drinks and actually had a laugh, we've joked and hugged and have been relatively normal siblings. My parents are falling apart, they found a letter today addressed to us, it clearly was supposed to be found if she had successfully committed suicide.

I'm angry, confused, I feel emotionally cold and exhausted. I need any advice you can give right now because I'm either never going to forgive myself as a result or the world around me will shatter."

"Just looking for some helpSo i don't know how to start this or what to write but i guess i should say something about myself and why i want to do this. The thing is i have been fighting this for about 3 years now, expecting things to get better but they haven't. My father is abusive verbally and sometimes physically. My parent are together however he abuses my mom verbally as well. The reason that i fell suicidal is because of him mostly. I cant handle all his shit that he throws and all the pain he causes. One time he woke up up in the middle of the night and just started beating me because apparently i broke something of his. Then he kicked me out so i left but after a week i was welcomed back home. He views me as a disappointment and has said so because i didn't get into a good college and am going to a community college. He makes good money but refuses to pay for my education. The reason that i haven't killed myself yet is because i don't want to leave my mom alone with my sister. I can barely sleep at night and because of him when i do sleep my dreams are plagued with me fighting my father all the time. I have such hate for him and everything he does but i was raised not to strike out at my father or fight him. I don't know what i should do because i think ill start going insane if i keep on feeling such hate for him and will eventually be driven to kill him, but that isn't something i want to do. So naturally the only thing is for me to commit suicide and get rid of this burden and his constant pestering. Sure i have friends and i talk to them alot but ever since i fought with my best friend because he backstabbed me i couldn't get over it. I realized that all these...friends are just people we just value them more and i cant count on them because people care for themselves mostly. I get decent grades at school mostly a's and b's but i dont apply myself enough cause i have no motivation to complete school. To be honest i didnt even see myself going to college because i didnt think i would live this long. Anyways thats enough about me."

"There's no other way and I'm getting closer to the end.I lay in bed tonight and finally realize it is time to go soon. I've felt this way for years, and it's not changing. I don't even know where to start, I don't want attention, or sympathy. I just need someone to understand where I'm coming from. I want my last words to be everything bad that's happened to me. I want everyone I love to remember the good and everyone who has done me bad be faced with the fact my death is their fault. 

My life was fine up until the summer after fifth grade. I was a naive child then, but all I knew was my mom could not pay the bills anymore. We were about to become homeless. Her solution? Contact her half-brother she hadn't spoken to in forever. He let us move in his trailer days before we were to be evicted.

I'd never met this man before, but three months into living with him the child within me had been exposed to a different sort of monster. Beer cans everywhere, music blasting on school nights. Him yelling and me cuddled up against my mom as she told me it's alright before popping another pain pill.

We all ended up moving to another home in 7th grade, and his alcoholic fits of rage at night got exceedingly worse. I was going to a school out of my school zone and he was the one taking me to school everyday. My mom had no car. He was our provider. I guess this is why he thought it was okay to masturbate in the car every morning. I guess the fact he was our provider was the reason why I never said anything. What child wants to be homeless? What child wants to go hungry?

I ended up moving in with a friend during 8th-9th grade. Moved back in with my mom and him at the end of 9th grade after my friend's parents didn't want to provide for me anymore. If only they had known why I sought a sanctuary in their home. Those nine months with them were the most peaceful my life has ever been.

Same 'ol same. The rage and threats towards my mom got worse. So did her pill problem. So did my self mutilation. So did my anorexia. But he'd stopped masturbating in the car. I was grateful.

The start of tenth grade it started back up again. I thought he'd stop this. My grades were dropping by then. I'd dropped out of my favorite extracurricular activity. I created a makeshift hog tie out of a piece of thick wire and had it hanging in my room, waiting. I tried once, it popped out of the ceiling. My mom eventually noticed. I told my mom I was suicidal. She never got me help. She'd seen the cuts before too. Still, no help for me. 

It was November 23 of 10th grade, that night he was really angry. He was threatening us with death, so my mom called the cops and we escaped out the back door. As we were running down the road to the sound of the sirens, I told her about what he'd been doing. That night we made a police report against him.

He turned himself in a few days later. I dropped out of the rest of tenth grade. My mom and I finally had the house to ourselves. That would have been great if my mom hadn't cared more about drugs than getting up off her fucking ass and doing something to pay the bills. We somehow got by for a couple months, but finally the water got shut off. Then the electricity.

I lived inside that house for a month with no water and electricity. Hot Texas heat and no food can sure have an effect on you. I was sick all the time. I'd lay in the bed under a bunch of covers hoping I'd have a heat stroke. 

She went to jail one night and I had nobody, so I called my older brother. He came from Houston to pick me up. He lives in a one bedroom apartment but that was okay. I was safe there. I would be fine. Not a lot to tell except he got me reenrolled in tenth grade last year. That and he also has a methadone and xanax addiction. He'd either be passed out on the floor or violent. He let me do cocaine once, and would also give me xanax. Fuck, he even gave me a small amount of methadone once. What 16 year old gives a fuck about their health when offered drugs?

I ended up moving back in with my mom this past July when he barred me from enjoying the summer with my friends, forcing me to sit around and endure his drug induced fits. Guess where my mom's living? Not on her own! With a ""roommate."" A good friend's husband. His wife is in jail for pedaling pills of course. 

I thought he was a good guy. I guess my mom does too, lol. Except he's come into my room multiple times telling me he'll buy me this or buy me that if I go off with him without my mom. Oh and not to mention he's called my legs sexy. OH, and did I forget? Lifting my blanket up and saying ""I thought you'd be naked under there!"" Haha, and my favorite, slapping me on the butt while I'm laying down. My mom's response? ""I know it's uncomfortable for you, but not trying to be that way."" The hell he's not you stupid bitch.

I'm 17. I never wanted to live this long. I refuse to live till my 18th birthday. I've been in bed depressed for days since he started this. This is the end. This is proof that my life isn't getting better. I'm not going anywhere. I have nobody. I don't go out like a normal teenager. I sit around trying to get a shitty buzz of robutussin. I'm ready to go. Even if my life were to get better, I've held this weight on my shoulders forever. I'm scarred. 
Nobody is there for me. Not even my own fucking mother.

I don't want another piece of shit man to abuse me again. I'm done. I've decided how to go. I'll make it as peaceful as possible. Helium tank and mask. It's something I've researched for years. Sorry if you actually read this all. I'm just ready and nobody ever wants to listen. Maybe somebody will listen this time. 

I hope there's nothing beyond life. I'd love a peaceful nothingness for once. Just once in my life could I sleep forever."
"It wasnât worth it.A while ago I left public school and started online classes. I had always hated school my whole life. I wasnât unpopular or treated bad, I just hated school. I had always wanted to do online school and I finally got what I wanted. What came with it was something I never expected. Now Iâm not saying that online school causes depression or suicidal thoughts, but in my case it did. 

I was closed off from the public, no more friends, no more sports, no life. I started gaming, I loved it and soon it became my life. The community was toxic however, I found myself rapidly losing *me* within it. I did things I regret, said things Iâd never say, became someone who I didnât recognize and before I knew it I was depressed, suicidal, crying constantly and in and out of horribly abusive online relationships at the age of 15. I overly sexualized myself, doing things a girl at that age shouldnât have been doing. I hated me. But I was trapped because thatâs the only form of socialization I had. 

My family didnât notice the cuts on my wrist. I hid them well. Bracelets and long sleeves, foundation and bandaids. I never cut very deep, just enough to sting, to leave a mark. Soon it became an addiction. The second I felt unhappy, cutting was the outlet. I found myself unhappy more times than not, crying so often my eyes were puffy and cheeks burnt from salty tears. I had never even heard of suicide or cutting before any of this, but not the two of them were my life. I remember writing countless suicide letters to my family, crumpling them up after. 

It all came crashing down when I went to the hospital one night for appendicitis. I had cut previously so fresh wounds were on my wrist. I tried to hide them but the inevitable happened and the surgeons found my cuts. I was talked to, my family cried, asked why Iâd do something like this. I lied and told everyone I was stressed about school, they all believed it because I had become the best damn actress put up on this earth. 

After that incident and dealing with the case workers, I was released and went home. My family took away my collectible knife, for no reason really because they shouldâve known I never cut with knives, blades were sharper. 

I stopped cutting after the hospital for a while, they sent me home with a bottle of codeine pills for the pain from the surgery to remove my appendix. I had no pain really, but I realized the things I could do with codeine pills. First it was the want to get high, but one night I fell back into old patterns and found myself so upset that I took 5 pills, having taken 5 the previous day as well. Knowing codeine, it stays in the system for a while and soon I found myself nearly dying. The next day I could hardly stand, falling down, dizzy, throwing up. I could hardly stay awake but I had to go out with my family, I couldnât let them know. I gathered what consciousness and strength I had to shower and get ready before we left. I lied and said I had food poisoning and didnât feel well so I could stay in the car while they went grocery shopping. I remember fighting for my life in the car alone, going in and out of consciousness, puking into a shopping bag and tossing it outside before they came back. 

When we got home I remember sleeping for a very long time. Waking up, sleeping, waking up, sleeping. What sucks is I never even got high, never felt a buzz. I itched a lot, my head felt like it was on fire. It was the worst experience of my life and I can say that it scared me so badly that I never tried killing myself again. I stopped cutting for years after the incident. 

Suicide isnât worth it. It isnât glamorous, it isnât easy or painless and it doesnât make anything better. Suicide is not the answer. I realized that day that what I was doing was the dumbest thing I could ever do. I was dying, I was hanging onto life, fighting those pills from taking my life and it was horrible. I didnât want to die. 

I do not want to die."

I'm honestly at the point where I don't really have an immediate desire to kill myself but fuuuuuuuuck I hate my birthday, at least I'm working that day and won't be doing anything special or celebrating, so there's that. Celebrating is rubbing salt in the wound, makes everything 10 times worse. I thought I had decided to not kill myself for the immediate future but hell, my birthday coming up is making me question that. Like maybe not existing would just be easier ya know?? I don't fuckin know, sometimes I just kinda wish I was aborted as a fetus."

"22 yo old male, lost any hope to be ever succesfulI am reaching 23 this year and I haven't achieved anything yet. I am starting a college this year when all of pepole in my age gradiated.
I am virgin living with parents. Never had girlfriend and don't even trying to get one 'til I will get a job and own space. I will be 26, maybe 27 years old then so who would even want a miserable loser? Yeah, I may lower my age on Tinder and lie that I am not virgin but it's only good for some ONS and not getting any relationship.

Girls never liked me, I was always repulsed and I was the guy who just follow friends but they didn't want to talk with me and I was always behind. No one wanted to talk with me even if I tried. I am feeling like a worthless shit and I am thinking about suicide.

I was also in mental hospital and strongly bullied in school so I am probably fcked up for rest of my life
I am right now fat 6'1, exercising, trying to get super-fit but I am not confident, I can't talk with girls and I am boring. I am even to afraid to be on gym with others or just say ""hi"" ans that's why I am exercising early morning or really late evening."
"I can't ignore it anymoreI'm 18 and I've already completely fucked my life up. My entire childhood was horrible. I fucking hated secondary school and I have nightmares about it constantly. I just wish I could go back and change everything, or at least be able to remove the memories from my conscience. I've done nothing but fuck up my entire life. I drove away the only person I ever truly bonded with. He loved me until I put him off me with my neurotic personality. Every night I wish I could hold him again. I'm an embarrasment to my parents. They might not even think that themselves but I am. I'm fucking useless. I've never accomplished anything even when I've tried.

I got my A Level results back a few days ago and they were below mediocre. Two Cs and a D. I wasn't surprised though, I know I didn't revise anywhere near as much as I should have. 

Not that it even matters anyway, because they were in worthless subjects (History, Politics and Law). I chose those subjects because I took the stupid advice of my parents who said they had ""transferable skills"". What a load of fucking bollocks. They're probably lying to me to make me feel better about not being good enough. 

And before anyone asks ""well, why didn't you take any STEM subjects?"" - I wanted to. Unfortunately, that choice wasn't available to me because I didn't pass my GCSE in maths. And I think that's one of my greatest weaknesses, my dyscalculia. I was forced to resit it three times and didn't pass until I sat the foundation paper like some sort of fucking spastic. 

The only way to earn any real amount of money nowadays is through getting a STEM degree, and that's off the table because of my inability to do mental maths. And you know what? I've tried coding with Python before and I have no problem with it, but having difficulty with arithmetic is enough to shut the entire field from me in the professional sphere. 

I know I have a bleak future ahead of me. What is there that I could do? If all that's open to me is working behind a counter in McDonald's or stacking shelves at Tesco for the next half century then I'll walk in front of a fucking bus. Just the thought of having to live here for the rest of my life is enough to make me scream. I fucking hate this city, it's full of white trash and scummy chavs. 

At this point all I want to do is make my parents proud of me, and for them to not think that they poured 18 years of effort into a failure. But I know I won't. I'll never amount to anything and I know it. I'm useless and incompetent. I don't even deserve the life that I already have. I don't even know if there's anything I can do at this point to reverse the trajectory I'm on. I've only just become an adult and I've already ruined my life through my clumsiness and stupidity."

"Unintentionally unhelpful relativesSometimes I have a moment where I make a flippant (but too real) remark in the wrong tone, and my sister catches it, and she knows I mean it. We aren't super duper close, but we're close to the point where we can read each other, and we did a lot of our growing up together, but not all of it. And for background, she attempted to kill herself when we were in middle school, and sometimes I forget. It was during a period of time we were apart, and I wasn't there for her. The situation was shitty. But she did, and went to the hospital and stuff, and seeing her like that was hard, because I didn't quite understand it. I didn't know. But now, like. Twelve years later. She's so confident, so happy. She has all her ducks in a row. And we've talked about it, what she tried to do, how she felt, etc. And she says she's just not depressed anymore. She gets sad, but she doesn't take meds anymore, and she's okay. 

But the advice she gives. The 'pep' talks. *""It gets better.""* No, for you it did. That doesn't mean it will for me. *""Anyone can overcome anything with the right attitude.""* No, they can't. She also flipflops on whether one 'needs' meds for depression. *""I would be really upset. The kids would be really upset.""* The guilt doesn't help. 

It just. She means well. But sometimes I just see her, and talk to her, and then I feel worse than I did before visiting her. Like she thinks she's helping. 

So now a usually happy visit (to see my nieces) is causing me a massive amount of stress. And I have to drive to see her tomorrow, and I don't really drive anymore, because my mind wanders to dark places. "
Mom said he would rather kill meShe would rather kill me than I committing suicide.Does she said that to make me feel better shouldnt have talk to her cause I go fucking mad after she said that.
"Really struggling and hopeless. Thinking about killing myself.Hello, this is my first post on Reddit. (Kinda sad, uh?). Im a 21 yo whose first language isnt English so excuse my mistakes. This year has been really rough for me. Years ago, about 3-4, I tried to kill myself. Couldnt keep going. Took a bunch of pills and got into the bathtub. I failed, I ended up puking it out. My family didnt even notice. I had really hard times, I wasnt well with my parents, or friends. I just wanted to end it. Since then, I started to get help. Psicological help, medication ... I started getting better, my relationship with my parents was healing, I got friends and even a girlfriend. Started studying again, all was going great. 

Then 2020 happened. In January, my mother, who I loved more and more esch day, was diagnosed with cancer. Real bad. Then, a couple days later, my gf dumped me for another girl. Man. I felt so ... Abandoned? By my ex-gf when I most needed her. It hitted really had. A couple months went by, stopped talking with my exgf cause it was too painful. I focused on studies and my mother. Then quarantine came. The only reason I havent tried to kill myself again was my mother. I know that if I do that, I will kill her too. Life is meaningless. I just want it to end. After all those years, all my work to get better, all I managed to do ... For nothing. I sended a message to my ex gf today. Thinking it would help. We have been chatting. It doesnt help. I do keep taking my antidepressants. It doesnt help neither. I spend my days sleeping all I can, so I dont have to live this ... failure. 

I call my depression ""The void"" cause thats how it feels. A void of meaning, of love, of anything. The void is back. And I feel it. It is telling me that no matter what I try, what I do, it is there. It is gonna come back. Fake relationships, work, family ... Nothing matters. It is gonna win at the end.

So I just want to end it all. Fuck it. I really really really wish to disappear. I wish my mother would forget about me so it doesnt hurt. My friends too. I dont wanna hurt anyone, I dont want to. Thats whats keeping me alive. 

Im sorry if that was too hard, but I needed to tell someone. I dont know if someone is ever read this, but yeah, here it is."

"No Reason to liveThe only thing anyone cares about is making sure people don't kill themselves. Even if you search ""reason to live"" on Google all you get is a bunch of suicide prevention sites and suicide hotline numbers. I don't think my mom could handle it if I died which is the only reason I'm still here so congratulations google I'm not going to kill myself but now I'm still here and hating every second of it. I have no reason to care about myself or my life so I do the minimum to keep breathing just to make people happy. I'm trying to wait until my mom dies to kill myself but tgere's nothing wrong with her so she at least has another 20 years. I'm trying so hard to wait but I don't know if I can do this for 20+ years. I've tried a bunch of different medications and I go to therapy do what my therapist tells me to do and I still feel like shit. I have absolutely no reason to believe that things will get better."

"ITS HAPPENING So 2 weeks from now, Iâm going to go and hangout with a girl who Iâve been talking too for a while. We send memes to each other a lot and I think sheâs cute, so Iâm very very very nervous. My stomach is turning just thinking about it. How do I ease this anxiety and not completely destroy my chance with her???"
"I'm broken and exhausted.Hi all, first time posting here. Idk what to expect, I just need to vent.

I'm so incredibly exhausted by living. I'm broken in some fundamental way and I can't be like other people. I don't think I'll ever be normal and therefore I won't ever be happy. I feel deeply sad all the time but that's not why I want to die. I want to die because I can't fix myself. I've seen relatives with my condition and they're all alone, everyone hates them because they're such terrible people. I'm following their path against my will, I can't be anything but a negative influence on people so what's the point? I can't be happy or content in myself, I bring misery to those around me so what is my purpose? I'll never be fixed so there's no point going on. I just can't relate to other people, I feel like a robot or an alien and I don't know why I'm so disconnected, I just am. 

I've lived such a life of misery, I just want it to end."

Day 183 of random questions Whatâs the most annoying thing about the internet?
"I was at such a low, I was actually going to go through with it.To anyone who it may concern,

I think that the time has come to end this wretched existence. If I had done this a lot sooner, I would have saved a lot of people a lot of pain and trouble. But trouble is all I can seem to cause people. Trouble, pain and inconvenience. I have never been anything short of a waste of space; something to be laughed at, abused and scorned. Iâve heard that people love me and I would like to know who the hell these people are. From what Iâve seen, love is just a word casually thrown around for the simple sake of boredom or entertainment. There is no love in this world. Just lust and fleeting urges. Like the ones that âmakeâ people do horrible things to children. 

The day I realized it all, I was contemplating where I wanted to go with my life. By my familyâs standards, Iâve accomplished the greatest of feats; Iâm not pregnant, nor do I have kids or have I had sex. I graduated high school and was going to college. Of course that ended abruptly as most good things do and now Iâm left without a passion for art, nor any care about anything else. I donât care about anything anymore. Before I could think of everything I wanted to do in my life like as in traveling, falling in love, getting married, living off my art or even just owning a small cafÃ©. But now, it doesnât matter. Iâm too broken to ever be good enough for someone. And since Iâm not a loose whore, I will never be with anyone. And I guess not ever now anywayâ¦

If anyone is even reading this at all, I just want you to know Iâm sorry you found me like this. Iâm sorry you even had to scrape any part of me off of whatever or had to put up with me at all. I just wish that I had never been an accident in the first place and that I never wasted anyoneâs time. I wish my siblings had never known I existed. I wish my parents didnât have a failure such as I as offspring. I wish my parents all the best and that they can find someone to replace me as a better child. I wish my two best friends hadnât had to put up with my antics. I wish that I hadnât made them pay attention to me when I knew they were better off not bothering with me. I wish that I had died the day I fell down the flight of stairs or when I was little. I wish I never hurt anyone by knowing me. I wish I had drowned that day I fell into the ocean.

Iâm sorry [female friend] for being so depressed all the time and making you listen to me when you had to study. Iâm sorry that I was always so inconsiderate of what you had to do. Iâve always thought of you as the big sister I always wanted.

Iâm sorry [male friend] for being so embarrassing to be around. I know you resent me for not being what I was supposed to be. Iâm sorry that Iâm always taking up the time you could be using to be around people who are more important. Thanks for being my big brother.

Iâm sorry everyone else I didnât name. Iâm sorry Iâm so forgetful that I canât even remember people who wasted their time on trying to help me. I never had a chance to go anywhere in this world I was given and Iâm so, so sorry you were forced to help me along the way. I appreciated it so much.

To [both friends]: You two get 25% each of what I owned if you want it. Money included. My mother gets 50% for funeral expense. And as an added bonus, you can burn all of my art. It was crap and I donât know why I pursued it.

I donât know what comes next. But whatever it is, I deserved it. Be happy with that."
"Iâm not trying hard enoughI literally just woke up and my mom is just saying all of these unmotivated things, then when she left I just started crying. Itâs been a while since Iâve cried I was honestly getting worried. My mom told me I wasnât trying hard enough bc I wasnât seeing my study skills teacher on Zoom. But only if she knew how big my mental block is.

I am homeschooled so this is my job, I have 8 missing assignments in each class and my plan is to get 4 assignments done everyday. (I only have 4 assignments each class each month). My mom telling me the Im not trying hard enough is making me realize that I literally canât do anything. Iâm so tried I literally just want to sleep but unfortunately my sleep schedule is flipped.

What Iâm trying to say is that I donât want to die, but that really seems like my only option. You can tell me to suck it up and do the work but my mindset is already so messy I canât really do anything. I tried going to my friends but they canât help either bc they canât focus. Why is this so hard?

Update: she just came into the bathroom telling me how I woke up almost at 2pm (I woke up at 11:30pm) and how my dog peed on the floor.... if I was a sleep, and you took my dog out of my room, why didnât you take my damn dog out?? Then you tell me âitâs not my jobâ or âIâm home sickâ maâam Iâm sick too but Iâm still trying. Just open the door... I donât understand whatâs so hard ab that. This isnât the worst thing but this definitely ticked me off."

"I was 5150'd against my willI called the crisis line regularly after I discovered it. I have a lot of issues and I haven't had consistent therapy in like 10 years. It was a sort of stop gap for my issues. A lot of the time, I just need to talk to someone to get some feelings out.

About three years ago, I called the crisis line to ask for help. I was having a really rough bout of depression, and it was apparently so bad that they called the cops on me. I tried to refuse, but they declared me a danger to myself and took me away. 

My experience wasn't close to the worst, but it was awkward and awful in its own way. The EMTs were really nice, but it was clear that the nurse thought I was wasting her time. She left a HUGE bruise on the blood draw.

Anyway, the point is, I can't call the crisis line anymore. Every time I try, I start panicking. Now I am stuck. Whenever I am deeply depressed and just want to talk, there is no one to. I have no support in my friends or family.

I am not denying the threat that suicidal ideation is, I just want to be able to talk to someone who won't throw me in the ER against my will. There is no way to tell them, ""Yes, I'm suicidal, but don't commit me, please.""

I can't afford to go to the ER, either monetarily or time wise, but I need to talk. Advice?"

as the decade comes to an end, i realize now that my life has always been messed up. not as bad as others, but i'm not strong enough for it to seem as small as it really is. if i kill myself at any point in time, please read this and you'll know why.

before i start, let me say, i'm struggling with gender identity as i'm typing this so let's just say i'm young and non-binary, born female.

\--------

when i was born, i had and have multiple sicknesses. none are really visible, and i'm not sure exactly what they are, but i have a very distinct scar on my lower stomach. 

from ages 1-4 i lived with my grandmother, my mom, my dad, and my uncle. my uncle was and is severely depressed, and just started abusing drugs at this point. i don't remember much from this time in my life, but it was mostly happy. he made a video/movie about his life and i was in it. there was alot of violence and i remember that in the film, my mother was being chased by a man with a gun. i've had a fear of my mother being killed ever since then.

from ages 5-9 i moved to a new house with my parents, but i visited my grandmother frequently and her house was kind of like a safe place to me. around age 6 or 7, the same man who chased my mother with a gun in the film (he was a friend of ours) came to our house, drunk, and assaulted both of my parents with either a pistol or a bat (can't remember). my step brother sexually assaulted me multiple times, and my grandmother had to sell her house. my uncle attempted to kill himself by ODing on drugs in our bathtub. some guy my age at the time touched me in places that i wished he didn't.

ages 10-11, i started feeling depressed and thought about self harm. came out to my parents as pansexual by having a breakdown in front of them. i started having frequent visits with a school counselor. another guy my age kept calling me things like ""his sex toy"" or ""slut"" and he'd always tell me about an nsfw dream he had about me, him, and another guy.

age 12 up until now. started cutting, lying to my parents, getting into toxic relationships. was manipulated into being in a relationship with some girl i didn't like. was sent to therapy. drove/hiked through an EF1 tornado, one of my best friends passed away, my step-brother was kicked out of the house and i've only seen him once since then. my boyfriend, who was the only person i trusted at the time, ghosted and cheated on me, my friend calls me every night saying she's going to hurt or kill herself, and i almost committed suicide."
One of my close friends is mad at me What do I do? Iâm assuming I shouldnât talk to him for a bit but can I have some tips ?

I am so fucking afraid of going to into the principal's office rn I shouldnt be tbh. I just want to get my documents stamped. But the principal werent there when i came into his office 2 times. It just feels so awkward
"I was born a burdenI've always felt like a burden. Whether it be the medical bills to the food to the clothing, I've just always been a detriment to my family. I don't live lavishly, I let my sister and mother and father live the life they can. Part of that life includes reminding me how much money I've (l)(c)ost my parents. My mother has always been this way and up until recently, I had just had to deal with it. I grew depressed and eventually turned to drugs and alcohol. However, I always kept a fine GPA and stayed in tune with what I was good with and kept working on my various side projects. That became too much for me and I looked into moving in with my father for the time being due to the fact that my mother had become unbearable. My father, a much more timid spirit, could continue to talk to me in a serious conversation instead of devolving from worried to screaming like my mother. 

I've gone to many different therapists to help with family problems, depression, and some mental troubles. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia earlier last year and instead of helping me my parents decided it was in their better interests to ignore it and because of this I currently have to wake up in the morning and suffer every second while I'm awake until I sleep which turns into a 3 hour turn-and-toss fest until I wake up and don't have the will to try sleeping again.

To get to work and school, my father helped me buy a car. No longer can I tell if he continually reminds me of the car's price and how much he could've done for himself with the money. I want to pay him back as soon as possible but I am in no position to even start dealing with that matter.

My mother can't be trusted. She goes out of her way to make my life harder. She will call and text me every 2 hours asking if I'm available for dinner or some sort of meeting where when I decide to meet her she will spend as long as she can doing her best to remind me that she gave birth to me and it was the worst mistake in her entire life.

I no barely eat at this point because I'm afraid to walk into the kitchen and make food out of ingredients I didn't purchase and I'm barely making enough money to pay for school and gas as it is. I cry on average 2 or 3 times a day but I think it's just a bad habit because I haven't gained anything from it yet. 

I still consider suicide every day but it's not feasible when considering the position I am in. It's selfish. I read that suicide has a greater chance of hurting me long term over killing me. If I attempt suicide, I'd probably mess it up and end up becoming a figure that sits in bed all day and drains my parents' money on medical bills. If I do somehow succeed with suicide, my parents will end up having to pay my funeral expenses.

At this point in life, I'm slowly building up the money so I can safely move away and cut all contact with my family. Maybe I won't be happy but they can be.

I'm lost"
"Its 2 am. I'm still awake how? Why? Anyways, I'm the only dude I know who's up so, it'd be cool if u DMd me or something"
Itâs taking everything in me not to kill myselfI havenât felt like this in so long. Iâve been sober for 19 months and all I want is to take a hundred pills. Iâm so sad. Anxious. I would kill my self right now if I was home alone but my mom left my brother with me for the night. I donât know what to do. I wish I was dead. Iâm sick. I canât stop crying. Someone please make all the hurt stop. 
"Idk how to say this (TW: TALK OF SUICIDE, SELF HARM, AND EDâs) 
Ok so I donât want it to seem like Iâm complaining about my life, I know people have it much worse than I do. I know no one asked, but I really just wanted to get some stuff off my chest. 

ALSO, Ik what Iâm writing may be kind of worrying or something, but please dw Iâm aight, just gotta rant. 

Before I get into it hereâs a short backstory: I moved from the US to a country Iâd never been to before when I was thirteen, after living in the same neighborhood for my entire life. I had an eating disorder and problems with self harm, which worsened after I moved. I had a string of useless therapists that did nothing or made stuff worse. Also, right after I moved I got into a toxic relationship with this edgelord type dude. I really didnât love him, I was just dating him because I thought I needed to âfixâ my sexuality (dumb, I know). Then around a year ago my dad moved out and my parents separated. He was cheating on her with his coworker, and refused to pay child support for a couple of months after he left. It was my job to ask him for the money. My mom, my brother, and I moved again due to safety issues in the middle of sophomore year. I relapsed into my Ed a couple of times throughout this. I havenât self harmed in over a year. 

Ok! thereâs the brief backstory of the darkest moments for my life

Now onto current shit: recently Iâve been getting really sad out of no where. I donât know if itâs because I need to process or something. I donât want to sound edgy but I literally donât see the point anymore. Like Iâm just going through the motions every day, trying to seem positive and upbeat, but I honestly couldnât care less. I try hard in school, I eat normally, I exercise regularly, all to made my mom happy. I donât talk about whatâs bothering me because I donât want to drive people away, so I make myself seem happy. The only thing I do that makes me somewhat happy now is art, but even that is getting harder and harder to keep up. Sometimes I really wish I didnât have to try so hard anymore. I really wish I could just die, and I definitely would if it wouldnât make my friends and family sad. Lately Iâve been thinking they wouldnât care anyways though."
"Been comsidering suicide for a year... now i think is the timeI am reposting this as my phone erased my last post. to make it short here i am at my wits ends 28 starting college no girl and just domt see a future in myself, Christian and of course losing my faith, I am just worthless as can be never done anything important just dont see a future in myself, been thinking about suicide for a year but i think ive reached the bottom of the barrel here and i want out I know where my grampas revolver is and i am planning on using it. Ive never been loved by a girl just had a shallow relationship once which really went out the roof in high school, I am pretty much done here in life im not motivated Bout starting college again I dont even think i will get accepted Im supposed to hear back from them but nothing i just dont care anymore about anything I had a plan about graduating college getting a job in cybersecurity finding a girl and starting a life have kids but alas i dont see that happening im too old job aint gonna want me anymore girls these days dont want a guy like me (they really never did ) I just want this whole thing to be over I am tired I wake up feel like crap and just want to end it all."
"bow to me peasants, it is my day of birth. that is all. have a nice day :)"
"I'm really sorryI love my friends. I thank you, folks online, too, for being wonderful people. I just... can't keep going."
"The dellemmaI want to kill myself right now, more than anything in the world, I haven't got any future, and my suffering will only get worse from here on out. I have a few obstacles though, if I die, whoever finds me will be scarred for life, and I don't really want that to happen. I don't know if anyone would really miss me, I am close with a few people , but the only person who would truly miss me is my mom, because of motherly love. The world *would* be better without me though, even if I am missed. I also might cause more problems for myself, such as brain damage or vegetablization, though my preferred method of hanging minimizes this risk. If I stay living the risk that I hurt more people with my death increases, but if I grow further from everyone and then kill myself, I won't be missed at all. I honestly wish I never existed, ""to be or not to be"" well the answer for me anyway it is not to be. I wouldn't suffer, I wouldn't cause anyone else to suffer, if I didn't exist the joy to suffering ratio would go up in the world. I wish I could be a martyr, that would really be something, or at least be killed accidentally instead of by myself, that would be a lot better. There's also the fact that I just don't got the balls to let myself die.

I just want to die, more than anything I want to be dead, but I can't do it."
"hearing how much i cost makes me hurt deeply.I'm coming to terms with the fact that my medical costs exceed my family's budget. I feel like such a burden. On everyone. Hearing that it'd be cheaper to cremate me than for me to get the dental procedures I need to be healthy hurt deeply. I've been suicidal for about 4 years now, but this is only fueling it. I feel as if I bring nothing to the table. Whenever I bring up medical problems I have, I get told off. I cant talk to my friends about it. I feel lost and hopeless. I just wish I didn't wake up this morning, or ever again. I want to just take a nap and never feel the pain of the real world again. In my dreams, I dont cost a dime. my friends are right beside me, and I get into the college I want without worrying about price. i want to cuddle with my pets and never feel fear or pain again.

im sorry if this is rambly, im in a lot of physical pain rn and im emotionally exhausted."
"How do you accept who you are? For those of you here, however many there are, what did it take before you finally accepted who you are as a person? I've always been one to repress a lot of the stuff that makes me different, or special (though that makes it sound like an insult), say for example me being a repressive trans. It's not that I wouldn't have the support if I chose to be open about that, it's more that I've always seen it as just another problem, which is why I repress it. Either way, I'm just open to hearing anything you've got to say, either here or in my dms if you'd prefer that."
"Goodbye I guess.This is a new account, I thought I was past my bad mental health or atleast I would actually get better. Nothingâs really changed, the more at peace I think I am gonna get at I end up at an even worse place. This is kind of the most clearest POV I have had on my life. I know all my trauma, all my mental illnessâ , all the people who actually like/love me. 

Itâs not worth being like this. I was never in peace, my whole life all I ever wanted was some peace and happiness. Nothingâs gonna change that fact. No matter how much I try or even almost get help. If by the end of next week (10th August) I canât go back to my university (I am an international student so like my university is in an another country), I wouldnât make it here. 

My mental health is getting worse, I havenât left this house since March and being in my country especially my house is a constant trigger for me. If I canât go back by 10th Iâll attempt suicide. I am so done with myself. I just canât do this, itâs so exhausting being me stuck with these thoughts which have been tormenting me since I was 5 years old. 

Honestly even going back to my university wouldnât change things that much for me except Iâll have weed to make me happy. It truly doesnât matter where I am, I am always miserable."
I did it guys i fucked For the first time I fucked up all my classes
I want to kill myself. I have been waiting in the National Suicide chat for hours.I keep trying to access the councilors and no one is answering. I feel as if I'm losing my mind.  
"tl;drHello, this may be a bit long-winded but I feel like it needs to be, sorry in advance (but I do appreciate you taking the time to read my thoughts).
P.S. This may come off as '/r/iamverysmart' type of wording, but I'm just trying my best to push past my disgust of being seen as a pseudo-intellectual, to honestly try and transcribe my thoughts to text. 

I've come to a point where, after almost 10 years of suicidal thought, I'm reaching the point at which there really doesn't seem to be any proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. And although suicide is not my ideal outcome (obviously, hence this rant), my persistent inaction leads me to believe that it is the inevitable conclusion to my life. So why now instead of later? My mind is plagued with cognitive  dissonance, which I manage through avoidance of anything that causes me even slight distress. This has only gotten worse as time passes, and it's progress doesn't seem to be slowing at any rate, which just leads to further avoidance of an ever growing list of situations. Should I wait for a time when I don't have the mental strength to even eat and maybe starve to death? Or is a better choice to rid the world of myself and leave it with a few more resources than if I chose to just continue leeching from anything I can, like a parasite.

I'm about to be 24, I live in an apartment that my parents begrudgingly pay for because they couldn't stand to live with me any longer, while also feeling that it was wrong to put me on the street, as they knew that is where I would be otherwise. I have 2 people that I describe as friends, although with time, I can sense their disdain building. I've hoped that they will cut ties with me for their own benefit, however I still selfishly cling onto them to satiate my crushing loneliness. At the risk of sounding like a whining incel, it's probably worth noting that I've never even been close to being in a romantic relationship with another person, and my only times of any physical contact are a 2 second, awkward, unwanted hug or handshake when greeting members of my family. I may be painting a picture of myself as a grouchy, edgy nerd that hates everyone, but the one thing I honestly can say about myself is that I really do try and treat everyone I come across with as much respect and courtesy as I am able. I recognise that I'm the sole reason for my circumstance, and even with all of the niceties of the world, and all of the resources that have been dumped into making me a valued member of society, I have come out the other end a heavy anchor, dragging down anything that comes near with my self pity.

I absolutely cringe at any sort of emotional expression, which makes writing this all the more difficult. I have tried to work out why I have such a visceral reaction to something that most have no problem with, but I have no good answer, I had a good childhood, great parents, did well in school until I dropped out when I was 15, and wasn't even bullied. Yet for some reason I can't even have the thought of telling someone my feelings without a waveof uncontrollable disgust. I have a similar reaction when confronted with any sort of challenge that healthy people find little issue, besides minor anxiety. Opening a job application gives me a panic attack, talking to a cashier makes me sweat, even the thought of applying for unemployment benefits makes me freeze up, placing the burden of my existence solely on my family. I have honestly made my best efforts to integrate into the world, but an impassable mental block swiftly thwarts any attempts, each failure pushing me to a new low that I previously thought impossible.

I could drone on endlessly about my 'problems', but this is probably a good place to conclude (even though I'm sure to have forgotten many things).
All I want is to be needed, but knowing that I don't, and never will have anything to give brings me forever back to the same conclusion. I truthfully
am searching for ways to dig myself out of this lifelong hole I've put myself in (I've tried; Medication, Meditation, Cardio, Weightlifting, Yoga, +
some other things), but my odds of success just keep shrinking.

Thanks for reading, writing this has been extremely cathartic, I hope nobody cringed too much."
"Jumping off a building in HoustonHey guys. So tomorrow I'm going to jump head first off the roof of the parking garage at Houston Methodist hospital. My thing is, this parking garage is only 100 feet high. I've read articles about people in Houston dying from it, but I'm afraid that it isn't tall enough to kill me. What do you guys think? I REALLY don't want to just be laying there on the ground, still alive and in mind-numbing pain. 

Also, I've made my mind up. For almost 2 years, I have struggled INSANELY with suicidal depression. Chronic suicidal ideation and Major Depressive Disorder. Schizoid Effective Disorder and Mania. 

I have been on every type of medication. Antidepressants. Antipsychotics. Antihistamines. Mood stabilizers. You name it. I've gone to therapy--individual therapy, group therapy, etc. 

There's just something in me that does NOT want to be alive. I HATE being alive. And I can't shake that feeling."
"My friend wonât stop seducing girls ok i know this is weird but hang with me, basically my best friend who is two year youâre then me is always chasing girls, heâs a good, he is also an extrovert and likes to seduce girls, in class, train station, wherever he is, he always strikes a conversation if he has the chance, he gets interested in a girl and spends time with her and them leaves her and friend zones her, at best he makes out or something, weâve known each other since we were tiny baby booboos and i donât wan him to get in trouble but he gets in trouble every time, all of his friends are girls which is totally ok but he has almost no male friends, he barely even talks to boys and when i ask him he always says that heâs afraid of them, what can i do for this imbecile pls help"
"Always felt like I would end up going by suicide, but I think the time is almost here.The past few years of my life have been a nonstop nightmare. I am nothing more than a punching bag for the world and those around me. I think I squeezed out a few extra years by numbing myself with drugs. I dont want to keep doing that though, its become just as exhausting. Today I figured out someone I used to know pressed charges from an offhand comment when angry nearly a year ago. I know whats gonna happen. Its going to stain my life and ruin a part of me, just like everything else does. 

I find myself almost perpetually in envy of others. Nothing ever seems to come to me in moderation. Im a cripple, depressed, personality disorder, covered in scars from accidents and surgeries....I just cant take it anymore. It makes it worse having to go be a part of the world, watching everyone go along with ease. Listening to people talk about their struggles makes me jealous. Im not trying to invalidate peoples struggles, I know there are people who are having a much more difficult time than I am. What I also know however, is that the great majority of people my age dont have these struggles. Bad things come, and then they just....go. Just like that for them. They tackle it and its gone...I would give anything for that. Problems arise in my life and they seem to ALWAYS take a part of me I will never get back. 

I am broken. The world has beaten me completely. I never stood a chance. I always sort of expected I would go by suicide, but now I am certain of it. I am truly, finally at the end of my rope. I simply cannot keep this up. Every waking second has been spent slowly coming to terms with the nothingness waiting for me. Im beginning to want to embrace it. I dont feel scared of it anymore. I long so much to not be tired."
"I want to escape EasterBut I donât know how.
I want to die peaceful, not feeling any pain, just feel myself slowly fading away. Like when your drunk, you donât feel anything expect that everything is a little bit fun 
I canât swallow pills, I have never been able to, and thatâs shit because that would be a great way to disappeared  

If Iâm lucky I can find drugs and overdose on them, but itâs much harder then it looks to get something. Iâve tried to ask some friends that I know have a connection with an seller but they just ignore when I ask or donât answer.
So now I have to go out there and try to find something myself, I donât care if itâs dangerous, I will happily let them stab or shoot me.

The other options are my least favorite, hanging or jumping. Both two options that I know I can chicken out, and even worse is that itâs getting lighter outside, which mean that more people will be out later and might see me do something 

I donât know what to do 
I want it all to stop, and I know that I wonât be able to make it this week
Cause no one will talk to me for a whole week
And I canât deal with being alone anymore"
"I Hate Myself and Want to DieFuck man, let's see.. I just have had a pretty wild time for the past few weeks. Failed out of my dream school (because I haven't gone to a class in about a month), wasted 50k of my parents money and just am so miserable and angry at myself. I guess it's just venting but I feel that suicide would be like ripping off a band-aid. It would hurt my family and those close to me (not that close, don't worry) but in the long run I'll just continue to be a failure who hurts others. Why stay alive? Right now it's just fear of dying, and you shouldn't live just out of fear"
"A piece of advice: DONT CROSSDRESS AS A FRENCH MAID IN SCHOOL (like I did) TL;DR at the end

This story took place almost two years ago when I was 15, btw

Before I explain what it is that I did, I have to tell you a little about my school. Even though it is a public school, it is very wealthy and has well funded programs, including in theater and dance. Another thing I should mention is the design of the school. Our auditorium has 6 different entrances/exits excluding the emergency exit, and they are all supposed to be locked when the room is not in use, but somebody always forgets to lock at least one of them. The 6th exit can only be accessed via going backstage and leads to a short hallway that is locked from the other side, meaning you can only get to it by sneaking into the auditorium, onto the stage and into the hallway, all of which us students shouldn't be doing. Anyways, there are two other doors in that hallway which lead to the theater and dance storage rooms. The theater room has a bunch of furniture, props, and costumes from old plays and musicals the school put on years prior. The dance room only has costumes, and holds the 100's of different outfits that the dance classes/teams have used. The rooms are only divided by a wall of cabinets, not a solid wall, so sound travels very easily between them. Both rooms are supposed to be locked but the dance teacher almost never locks her room. 

Anyways, I am a straight male, but for the past few years I have really enjoyed crossdressing. I don't know why, but I love the idea of dressing up in girls clothing (in private), the more girly the better. When I discovered the dance storage room it felt like a miracle to me. It had hundreds of girly and sexy outfits to choose from, floor length mirrors to see myself in, and was enclosed in a space where nobody would ever find me. A few times during advisory periods, I would sneak in there and try on a few outfits, and I loved doing it. One such time, I was putting everything I had just tried on back and was about to head to my next class when I saw a large bin filled with French Maid costumes. They all had a short dress w/ puffy shoulders, gloves, lots of lace, an apron, a duster, a headband, and (unlike everything else in the room), a pair of frilly panties. It was a dream find for me. I decided I would come back later to put it on. Luckily for me, I had to stay after that day to finish a test. After finishing it, my dad said he could pick me up in thirty minutes, which left me plenty of time to do the deed. I went over to the theater wing and found that entrance #5 was unlocked, so I was able to sneak back into the dance storage room. I stripped down to the nude in order to put the panties on, and then put the rest of the costume on over it. I loved everything about it. Just as I was about to take a picture of myself, I heard the jingling of keys, and I immediately dove into the darkest corner of the room, leaving all my regular clothes laying there in the middle of the floor along with my backpack. The door to the dance room was cracked open, and I knew that if this was the dance teacher she would find me and my life would be over. Luckily for me, it was my theater teacher, Ms. S. She unlocked the theater storage room and started doing something in there. As quietly as I possibly could I changed back into my clothes and threw the maid costume back into the bin in a jumbled mess. I put on my backpack and froze, remembering that the zippers on my backpack make jingling noises as I walk. I decided to make a break for it, throwing open the dance room door and running as fast as I could into the auditorium, before running out the 1st exit. I remember Ms. S. shouting ""Who's there?"", but I'm 99% sure she never saw me. I can only imagine what hell I would've gone through if she or anyone else had walked into the dance room and caught me. Me being escorted to the front office in the girliest dress possible . . . what an idea. Luckily that didn't happen, I learned my lesson, and never went back to that room again. 

TL;DR: I was crossdressing in my school's dance team storage room and was wearing a really girly french maid costume when my theater teacher went into the room next to me and almost saw me.

The moral of the story: DONT CROSSDRESS AT SCHOOL"
"I will do the Da Vinci Ooh, Da Vinci-chan ðð ðððððððððððð"
"Hey..I don't think of myself as suicidal, but I often think about what it would be like to do so.  I sometimes imagine how easy it would be to shoot myself if I had a gun handy.  I always follow up with ""nah, that isn't something I would ever do."" But sometimes when I'm down on myself I am glad I don't have a gun around because I'm afraid that if I did I might hurt myself.  This thought is the one thing that has ever kept me from purchasing a gun or asking my parents for my guns.  Why do I feel this way?

edit: This has recently started moving into my mind that it doesn't have to  be a gun, there are other ways I could quickly end it.  I don't want to die, but I always have ti at the back of my mind.  I hate to be making this post...I just want to fint a reason why I'm making it."
"So, what now?6th floor jump wont make it, noose is painful, paracetamol might but i prob cant get enough, no guns, easy poisons, nothing.

Im just done and im just such a fucking coward that i cant even attempt one of these things, i cant solve my problems i cant tell anybody about it i cant live life because a good mood instantly gets knocked down and i get to face the true reality of what an useless piece of trash i am, how braindead retarded i am for doing the things i do, for not doing things im supposed to do for not being able to do things everybody somehow fucking manages i just want it to be fucking over.
Rant over, not sure what now."
"I attempted today. I have completely lost control of myself. Need help.I have few medical conditions that make my depression worse. But all my attempts have been in fit of anger and not knowing what to do. I have been brought down to this condition by my narcissistic brother. Who made sure I never succeeded. Took(borrowed in his mind) all of my hard earned money. Abused me when I asked my money back. Manipulated me to take care of everything while he was settling in another country. As soon as his life got better he hit me to the curb. Denied me my money. Abused me. Called me a ""disabled fuck who is worthless"" to my mother while she just listened to him. And then tried to get the house(father's property) I am living in transferred to his name. So he can legally evict me whenever he wants. 

I don't see a future. I know as soon as my mother passes away my brother and sister will come and take what's left of me. I am tired of all the fighting. I have wasted last 5 years for this family. Sacrificed everything. Got abused and looted in return. I am tired now."
"its always the good shows that only have one season and then after all that waiting, the second season is absolute trash lol"
"Just wanted to share this Someone in my online class was asked to turn his video on, because it is required in this certain class. I just thought his reason for having off was very funny.  When asked to turn on his video, he claimed, ""my wifi lagged."" I don't know I just thought it was funny."
Iâm so excited for winter Itâs starting to become winter where I live and this year I want to get a snowboard to bring with me while Iâm sledding in the mountains so yeah Iâm looking forward to winter this year.
"The fear of living forever has ruined the serenity of deathThinking about suicide used to be a comfort for me. The only thing that got me by. Then last night the realization that after Iâm dead I might still exist forever came to me. I started thinking about how there might not be an end to this. Ever. THAT is my worst nightmare. Now the one thing I had left to turn to terrifies me...I feel so trapped and thereâs nothing that can end it..

Iâm going to go fucking insane"

But that 1 fucking % of time just drives me crazy and I can't handle it. It hurts and I don't wanna do it anymore. Why live a life that clearly doesn't want me since it's been fucking me over since my first memory."
Were all stressed about what happened today but look on the bright side Weâre getting fresh memes out of this
Wish I could leave my life behindWish I could just leave.  Drive as far away from my life right now. So many reasons why I canât do that though. Itâs very tempting to just leave in a more Permanent way because I canât do the former. Iâm just so conflicted I just canât take it anymore. Itâs everyday and itâs unbearable
"It's only 30$ to Uber to the Golden gate bridgeI could even spring for Uber comfort or Uber black. Not like my bank account will matter after this. Fatality rate is pretty high going off the bridge, very low chance I'll live too. It's as simple as stepping out of the car and stepping off the bridge, and I'll even know the time I will arrive. I've been staring at my phone screen and thinking ""I could die in like half an hour, neat.""

I really curse myself for going out with my current girlfriend. Just so you know, I'm an emotional black hole from having suffered so much, and so I latch onto nice vulnerable girls like my girlfriend and make them feel bad for me and close to me and then I leave them. Now I'm doing that but killing myself too. 

Oh, she'll be devastated if I kill myself. I lied enough to her so she likes me quite a lot. Thinking of how sad she'll be is really what's even kept me around. I remember when I was having a big suicidal stint last year, my suicidal brain hated her because her kindness and how bad she'd feel was the only thing stopping me. Anyway, no way she could deal with it, and I'm sure the university will destroy her since it's awful and loves stepping on people who are down on their luck. I could wait until her graduation but that's kinda far.

I want to do it so bad. I hate how I chose her, I was lonely and she was cute. We ended up having a great relationship, but it can't be great consistently because of who I am, and I can't change it no matter how hard I try. The longer I'm with her, the more I set her up for failure and waste more of her time. 

Recently I got really high and thought about a girl from work I could never have. I feel shame and hatred of myself really deep in me for doing that. If you knew my girlfriend you'd hate me too, because she's a saint. I can't tell if it's my suicidal brain trying to get me to break up with her so I can cut off all loose ends when I die, or if I actually want to break up with her. The suicidal brain makes me so certain right now that it's just because I want the relationship to be over, but I know even months ago I didn't believe that. Who knows. 

My head's so fucked. So fucked right nowm I'm so scared and I'm so fucking alone. I seriously want to know what the point of living is because I've only noticed it's a when lot of pain and suffering on my end. Oh boy have I wanted to kill myself recently. It's all I can think about. 

I don't really want to work until I die. Maybe I could just quit today, break up with her in the morning. Kinda just waste away in my room for a couple months using my savings, send her whatever money I can and make sure she's OK. Then, after finals, peace out. I guess I could do that. 

The nice thing is I see it happening. I can't force myself to Uber to the bridge now, but its easy to just quit my job, (slightly) easier to just break up with my gf with some excuse that will make her hate me. That's what I did with my ex, might as well repeat the cycle. I absolutely should die. 

God why did you put me on this planet? Why did you make me so alone? Why did you make me so guilty, why did you make me so fucked up. What's the point of making me sentient just so I can suffer?? It's not fucking fair I should be able to choose if I want to die. I should be able to choose. The only thing I should be concerned about when wanting to die is how I feel about it I'm so sick of people saying they'll be sad if I do it. I know it's my fucking fault you like me and I'm sorry I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry baby I can't do it. Something about my life was wrong from the start, could've been watching my dad die, being who I am which got me bullied, my mom not caring about me not having a real family its been fucked from day 1 and who cares if I've been privileged economically. I've bought most of the things I want and guess what I want to die. And it makes me feel even guiltier knowing my economic privilege. What is the point of me suffering and trying man."
"My story. I'm dramatic but it's trueMy life once made sense to me and anyone looking onto it. This life lasted a long time, until I met the love of my life. 
	The first time I met her, I didnât think much of her.  I had just transferred schools, and halfway across the states. I had no friends to speak of, the problem being I had moved a week before school started and had spent all my time unpacking all of our shit. Iâm not good at making good first impressions and Iâm a shy person. I was assigned to a homebase, and we pretty much spent the first day there acquainting new students to those who werenât. It was my first year being at a private school, and they were really corny about being open to all types of people and taught racial equality to a body of students raised to accept others. I made a few friends who I stuck with, and we had a bunch of classes together.
	My first class on the second day was astronomy, which was the elective I took that excited me most. We started a debate about space exploration and how it would advance in future years. Debates are one of the few times when I voice my opinion freely, so I was one of the leaders in the debate. It had reached a point where two sides were making great points, and I thought for sure there was no way Iâd be swayed in my decision. Wrong. This girl, weâll call her Elizabeth, countered my points and really got me thinking. She talked for a whole five minutes, but I only really was paying attention for two. She was absolutely beautiful. I was stunned. Eventually, her debate swayed my opinion and we finally came to a unanimous decision. The teacher said some things at the end of the hour, but all I was thinking of was her.
	After class I talked to her and told her I thought she was brilliant and she blushed and said thanks. Fortunately, we had the next hour class together, and stuck together for the class. We saw each other again at lunch, and she introduced me to her social group, which for a bit of a geeky girl, Iâm surprised was the popular crowd. I met the other girls, and although I admit they were hot, they were nothing like she was. I had only known her for a few hours, but she was kind to everyone we saw, friendly, intelligent, funny, and just had a way of lighting people up. I didnât fit in with them, and after a few days of hanging around them went back to the friends I made on the first day, most of which are still my friends today. 
	I had the attitude of a guy with a crush, and my friends knew I was into her. A lot of people were. She and I got to be better and better friends, and eventually she invited me over with a few other friends after school. We went out to the beach by her house and swam, watched strange foreign films, and baked a cake together and devoured it. The other two that had been with us had to leave after a few hours. I thought the night was already perfect and I had had more fun spending time with anyone than possible, but it was just the start of the night.
	If youâre expecting something sexual in this paragraph, get ready to be disappointed. Over the next few hours we watched Netflix and just had a good time. Eventually, we started talking about deep things and I really just spilled my guts about everything Iâve ever regretted doing or what has hurt me. She told me the same about herself. We just felt so comfortable with each other. Sure as a guy most of us scoff when girls say that, but you know if you open up it is true. She trusted me and I trusted her. I thought she was into me. She nestled against me until I had to leave, and when I did, had a look in her eyes that said, âPlease donât go.â That was the last thing I wanted to do. I was so happy still when I got home, and my family could tell I had way too positive of an atmosphere on me. I didnât care. I couldnât stop thinking about her and texted her all night. That was the highlight of my freshmen year.
	Over the course of a few years we had become best friends. I didnât know if she was interested in me much or not. Well, at least I didnât know if she was a lot or just a little bit. After considering it and spending hours practicing like a chump in the mirror, I worked up the nerve to ask her out. I had it all planned out: Iâd talk to her after first hour and hold her hands in mine, sit down with her, look her in the eyes, and ask if she liked me more than a friend. Confidently in myself but not cocky, Iâd ask if sheâd be my girlfriend and would be interested in heading down to a fancy Italian restaurant with me. It went nothing as planned.
	The ten minute period between classes finally came and I was incredibly nervous, even after planning to do it for weeks. I walked with her and told her to walk with me into the courtyard, and I had something to tell her. We made small talk, and like always, she laughed at my dumb jokes. We sat down and I did exactly as had planned trying to create a moment for her to remember. I popped the question. She got up, smiled, and walked away. 
	I didnât know what to think but I wasnât defeated yet. We still sat together second hour but it was a little awkward being together. The hour took forever. I thought of what to say or to do to try and end the uncomfortable position I had put her and myself into. I zoned out the entire class. At some point I was told about an assignment, I didnât know what. Frankly I didnât give a shit. The clock hand was being stubborn and moved slower and slower. My anxiety for class to be over swelled inside of me and I finally had a plan. Then the bell rang.
	I tried walking with her, but she made it clear she wouldnât be walking with me when she made her way to the other side of the hall when we heading to our lockers. She didnât once look at me the whole way down.
	I waited for her at her locker. She took a detour to avoid me, and I knew I wasnât giving her the space she wanted, so I tried to look solemn and passive as I waited. She snuck off from the rest of the crowd and came over to her locker, making sure not to notice me. I told her I knew she just wanted to be friends and Iâd try not to make anything weird between us again. She told me to fuck off.
	I had honestly never heard her swear. I knew she had no kind of commitment to anyone that I was messing with. I knew she hadnât just friendzoned me. I knew she wasnât on her period (yes this creepy, and yes, this is true). 
	We didnât talk for weeks. I told my friends what had happened and they comforted me. One even had a big sleepover and we played Call of Duty until our eyes almost boiled. It was fun, but I still couldnât get her off of my mind. They could tell every time I looked off into space what I was doing and would call me over to grab some food with them or whatever they could to distract me. They were great friends. Donât ever forget who your friends are and what theyâll get you through. Youâll need them just as much as theyâll need you. Thanks to events Iâll get to later, I lost most of them.
	It had been weeks without her, and she randomly came up and flung herself into my arms. Literally. She said she missed me, but still didnât explain why she rejected me. I was too busy being elated about getting her back as my friend that I didnât even bother to ask why, and didnât question it for quite some time. We started hanging out again, and everything seemed to return to normal, but it was still at the back of my mind. My friends were relieved when I told them.
	I finally asked her why. I didnât feel like it would be something I should do in person. I asked her over text. Maybe that was a regrettable idea, but I did it anyway. 
	It was late at night and we had been texting for hours, like we often did. Neither of us slept much at night, and usually just stayed up listening to music. We liked a lot of the same music: Nirvana, AWOLNATION, Bloodhound Gang, Tenacious D, Macklemore, Watsky, and she liked pop quite a bit. Maybe it was the way I asked that was so blunt, maybe it was the mood it spoiled, but she didnât text back for hours. When she replied, it was a simple âIâm just not interested in having a relationship with you, and weâre not really meant for each other that much.â No sentence has ever really hurt me like that one, not âI hate you,â or âGo kill yourself.â And yes, she has said both of those things to me.
	I looked into it with everyone. I creeped on her. She wasnât seeing anyone, and I wouldnât have been mad if she was, but I was curious, hurt, but curious. Nothing turned up. Just to be around her still, I pretended like nothing was wrong at all. But I knew I couldnât take it. It was too much. My grades spiraled from straight Aâs to Bâs and Câs. My teachers were getting concerned. My parents didnât care that much, and I guess that has only ever really bothered me in retrospect. They asked if anything was wrong but I just ignored them. They talked about grounding me and getting me a tutor for my dropping grades. They were just angry.
	So my family is a cluster-fuck of assholes, what I want most in the world seemscouldnt care less about me, but you know who was there again? My friends. But I fucked up a few times.
	I blew them off when they were trying to cheer me up. I ignored them when I was angry and didnât tell them why. I left them out of my personal life. I lost a few of them in some fights, but most of them tolerated me and tried to see me smile again.
	It seemed like I was recovering, and even went to a party at the beginning of the school year with my friends. We were finally seniors. We went and it was great, but weâre not real ladiesâ guys or anything so we didnât have much fun with that. And then I saw Elizabeth there. I asked her for a dance, and we did. It was fun even. She even said yes when I asked her to slow dance. I knew I loved Elizabeth. The night had been going great. 
	Had. Then we drifted off for a while, and she said sheâd find me when the next slow song came on. I was pumped for it. I was getting hot and sweaty being inside of the gymnasium with so many people, so I went out for some air. It was a nice cool night with a good breeze. There was nobody outside the gym, so I sat on the bench and took in the night air. It was beautiful with the moon out, and the flowers on the cherry trees were in bloom. I could hear some noise coming from out behind another building, even over the music. Curiosity always gets the best of me, so I went back to check it out. 
	It was like a movie. I saw Elizabeth giving some guy from another school a blowjob. I recognized him from Lacrosse, which Iâve played for years. Heâs a meathead. Heâs not attractive. He treats women horribly. She wouldnât go on a date with a nice guy who treats her perfectly and loves her, who shares everything in common. I couldnât think straight.
	Slow motion. I ran to the front of the gym. I almost vomited. I felt sick and nothing was computing. I didnât know what was wrong with me. I hated myself. I hated the jock. I hated and loved Elizabeth. I ran home. I cried the whole way like a bitch. A few cars slowed as I ran, but no one cared enough. I didnât care about other people. I cared about Elizabeth. I got home with nobody there. I stormed up to my room. I set shit on fire. I broke shit. I was devastated. I cried until I couldnât cry anymore. I passed out asleep.
	I awoke to my parents screaming at me. I screamed back louder and barricaded my door. I fell asleep again. 
	I didnât go to school for a week and had one of my friends be my mule for homework. All of my friends were fed up with me. They told me to act normal. A few tried to get me to go to counseling. I told them to fuck themselves. No one really knew what was wrong. It was my fault they left.
	I got into drugs. First I started smoking weed and drinking some. It gradually escalated. The high I was getting wasnât enough anymore. PCP, cocaine, meth, and heavy drinking started doing what I needed. I dropped out of sports and clubs. I didnât have time anymore. I started stealing and doing anything for money to buy more drugs. I had no one. No family, no parents, no friends. More importantly, I didnât have Elizabeth. 
	My existence wonât bother her anymore. Donât fuck up like I did. I wish I could take everything back. My life means nothing anymore. I have let down so many people, but so many people supported me. I blame her. Tonight, I might finish it all, but I want people to know my story. Maybe Iâll even recover. I need serious help.

"I'm so doneYou know, I've never asked for much in life. I just wanted to be happy, without ever wanting to be rich, famous or anything like that. I just wanted a loyal girlfriend and a happy and peaceful life so I can live through it and then die with someone I love. Yet, I always seem to get stuck. And then it drags on for months. Why do I have to be stuck in a relationship with a person I imagined to be perfect, but they're not sure whether they love me simply because of their mental health. I hate life. I hate everything about it. I hate the loneliness, the unknown. I hate that I've given everyone nothing but love and support and everyone turns their back against me. I hate that my own girlfriend doesn't even seem to care. I hate to not matter. I hate it. I hate it all and I wanted to end, finally. It's been two years. I'm so done."

Iâve isolated myself, Iâm angry and sad and I just cannot relate to others in a meaningful way. Iâd call the hotline but that never fails to make me worse. I am just stuck, I have nowhere to go. "

"I'm so disappointed by myself I don't want to live anymoreFor many years I have been contemplating the meaning of life. I have always been the kind of undecisive person never taking a real path and always changing my mind about things. I changed my major at university so many times and never actually graduate. So I took a job and got married at 22. Then moved to Thailand, my wife's country and found a job where I worked for 8 years and we had 2 kids. Unfortunately my confused personality reemerged again after my 31st birthday and I started sort of mid life crisis that pushed me to leave my job, I felt unhappy and wanted more but without any qualifications I was already lucky to have that job. I had panic attacks when I gave my resignation letter to the boss so that he realized I wasn't really 100% sane so now he doesn't want me back. 

After that I stopped sleeping, had furious panic attacks with me screaming in front of my kids and wife. Eventually I went back home and got in a psychiatric ward for a month where they gave my heavy sedatives and anti depressants. I attempted sucide with pills once. After a few months I felt better and went back to Thailand and for 1 year I have been able even to work for a new place and earn money.

Problem is now I feel deeply unhappy and insecure about my life, underappreciated by everyone. My wife simply doesn't understand me and tries to find obstacles instead of helping me. I feel depression coming back and I wish to end my life. Only my kids keep me here, I want to help them to survive this heelish world but with this conflict inside of me I don't know how to find peace."

"I can't stop thinking about suicide but if I do something about it, my life will be destroyed anyways.Hey guys, 

I don't know how much I want to say about what I do for a living, but I'm in an occupation that if it was found I'm considering suicide I would be absolutely destroyed. I do want help, but I cannot go somewhere where these thoughts end up in my medical record.

Things have gotten dark for me over the last couple years and I don't know why exactly. I find myself thinking about what death would be like all the time and weighing if it's worth living. I feel really fucked up about it because I also have a wife who I know loves me. I think I'm dragging her down with me too though. I know people are gonna suggest that I talk to her about this all, but I don't want to put it on her. I also don't want her to freak out and call a doctor or something. Many years ago I went through several weeks of panic attacks and told her afterwards that I had considered suicide and it was one of the only times I've made her cry. 

I already know my options for how I would kill myself and many of them aren't that bad. I guess the main other option I'm considering is just leaving everything behind and starting a new life somewhere else. I don't know if that would last though. I just think things would be simpler if I was dead.

I don't know if any of this makes sense since it was just a string of thoughts essentially. It's kind of how things have been lately. I'm not sad. I'm just ambivalent about everything. Reading over what I've written doesn't even seem to come close to the darkness of what I'm thinking about. Anyways, I don't know if I'm gonna hit submit or not, but at least I know I'm not alone being here."

"Yes, we are gamers too! Iâve seen posts and comments saying that Nintendo gamers or people who donât play as many hours arenât considered as gamers. Like, are you stupid?

Nintendo is a gaming company too, that makes their own consoles, that makes their own games, and is Nintendo gamers arenât actually gamers?

If you were to define what a gamer is, it would be a person who plays video games, so whatâs wrong with Nintendo? Theyâre a gaming company too!

All my life, I only owned Nintendo consoles, and I definitely consider myself a gamer. Iâve played hundreds of hours playing these lovely games, and theyâve changed my life.

But apparently Nintendo gamers arenât actually gamers because their games donât have enough action, or they donât have the best graphics. For fucks sake, just admit our games are different and move on.

If you like horror games, youâre a gamer. If you like action games, youâre a gamer. If you like open-world games, youâre a gamer. But if you like peaceful and family games, youâre not.

If you criticise someone for using a Nintendo console, Satan is a big fan of you, because you canât accept that people like things that youâre not interested in. 

So sit down, shut up, and play some Animal Crossing, because that will calm you down."

"Dear HumanityItâs funny how life works...it really is the roll of the dice. Some people live brilliant successful lives by climbing their way to the top. Some people live lives of heartache and pain...they then turn that into an art and become successful too. Some people are just ordinary and blessed with a family or maybe just a single parent and they thrive and overcome the odds. Some people are born with terminal illness, mental illness, disabilities, and whatever else and they all succeed. Then you got people like me...people who tried everything they could and fought their way with everything they had...only to not be enough. Now...here I am on this random reddit page venting this all out because I see no outcome other than death after this.

Treat people well, treat people with respect, treat those who are unfortunate and encourage them with love. Give them a boost anyway you can and just realize that we all are just one single species at the end of the day. The planet doesnât belong to us, we belong to the planet. If you have a significant other...out your arm around them and say how much you love them because you never know what tomorrow will bring. Make your significant other some food (breakfast, lunch and or dinner) whatever you feel like you can do...buy them flowers...take them on dates...make them smile and laugh, help them feel motivated like they can do anything. Most of all...let them know you will always be there. 

I was once so ignorant and arrogant that I thought I could help everyone. Because I hate it when people are hurt and I tried to make it my number one priority to help others in anyway that I could because I thought we needed more love in this world. I took on a responsibility that was impossible and I should have seen it coming...but alas I allowed my own ignorance and arrogance to blind me. That is my own fault and I take ownership for such foolishness. 

Now here I am recovering from a botched surgery that should have killed me and to be frank...I wish it did. When I finally got better and tried to start again with my monthly disability...natural disasters struck my hometown leaving many out of a home, car, everything. While I was lucky in that regard the day after the disasters happened my car was stolen...probably by someone who was desperate. So here it is...me...34 years old...tried to make something happen in my life...now it has all failed. Therefore I am officially a failure and I want this life to end. I am now just figuring out a way how...

I wish you all well and just...do your best in a world filled with hate, hostility, lies, deceit and cruelty."

"Counting pillsI've been depressed among many other mental health diagnosis since I was 13 years old. I am now 30. All my life I've had to struggle and fight for the things I wanted. Nothing has come naturally to me, I always feel like I'm grinding against life. 

2016 was quite possibly the worst year of my life. Not only did I suddenly lose a parent to cancer but I also had a complicated injury that put me off work for a while and in a very poor financial situation. 

This year at the anniversary of my parent's death it was like it was happening all over again. I had night terrors and a horrible feeling of pain and anxiety. Due to the nature of my work I didn't feel comfortable talking about it to anyone and therefore I didn't receive any support. 

Speaking of work, im at the point now where I think that they have it out for me so badly that if I mess up one more time, I'm likely to be fired. The evidence is mounting due to some vengeful coworkers and mistakes that occurred during the anniversary month (as I said above). I have zero friends there. I dread going into work. It's gotten to the point where I have no confidence in myself because they keep telling me I suck at well everything pertaining to this job. Despite my willingness to train and retrain and to come in all the time for extra shifts. I get no recognition when I'm doing well. It feels like if I don't get out soon I will have a mental breakdown or be fired.

I am worried about money, about losing my job which is the main form of financial support for my boyfriend and I. I feel inadequate and not good enough. I feel worthless and like nobody likes me. 
I feel as though there's no way my life could get better from this point and that maybe my personality leads me to get into these situations where I'm treated this way.

I attempted to get help by going to an ED but the inpatient unit was full and the ED staff treated me like I was unimportant and a piece of shit. (I'm not discouraging others from seeking help there). So I ended up talking the doctor into letting me go home with some meds and referrals to see someone outpatient. So they did do something for me but I just don't feel any better. My outpatient appointments are for next week but I need the help now. 

I want to die ...

I spent the last 10 days looking for ways to kill myself and at first was fearful of the pain but now I'm more focused on how to make sure I'm successful. I've overdosed on pills a lot of times but  never was successful but it seems like the only thing I have at my disposal. I'm not even sure if I have enough. But I figure if I take enough pain killers and then down a bunch of Ativan I'll pass out and won't feel anything. 

So that's where I'm at now... counting pills

I am so tired of thisI keep thinking about suicide everyday obsessively day and night. I cut myself and think about cutting deeper in hopes I can bleed out. I have even made a rough draft of a suicide note.
"I dont have anybody to talk to, so I'm just gonna type here to get everything off.I just don't know who to talk to and am probably just ranting here. I've been thinking of suicide for years, maybe since i was in grade school. I was bullied during those times and it does indeed get better. Though it takes 5 years that i finally got a friend. Maybe its because the thought has been embedded in my brain since i was a kid, even if it got better, I still really just want to kill myself everyday. I'm 19 now and i tried to reach out to my brother and talk about things and my past. Turns out he was the bully in his grade growing up (not the one who bullied me). Hah! People said there is karma but isn't it to convenient? Why me? When i told him i want to die growing up, he said ""well, i had such thought too last year when i got addicted to weed and my grades are falling. Don't you think everyone think about suicide at least once in their life?"" .... i was speechless. I've been hating myself and wanting to kill myself for 9 years and when i tried to reach out, that's it? I told him i was bullied growing up and hating myself because of loneliness. That's it? 

I am in college now with a major that i compromised with my parents. Assignments are pretty rough, with all the new lab classes i got into. I got tons of hw and even if this s my 2nd week into the semester, i have been putting an allnighter just to get everything done properly. My mom wants me to do something she likes and have been nagging me to do it too. I showed her all what i have to do just to prove her that i got no time and it has been pretty rough. ""It's just an hour and it's for your own good! Stop bejng lazy"" it has been going on since last semester tbh and i kind of couldn't hold it in and cried out of frustration. I did what she wants when i got the time, but when i cry she said, ""why r you even crying? You r a Grown up"", etc. She also forced me to relocate my guinea pig so that i wouldn't always be beside them when truly, they r my only sanctuary when it's rough. Looking at them makes me feel a tad better and i feel like now that they r my responsibility, i shouldn't just die off. But now the thought of wanting to die got a bit stronger and more frequent.

I know my problem is not as bad as all of you guys. I know I'm being such a wimp. That is why this is just a rant. I just need to talk it off so that this damn suicide thoughts don't get stronger."
"LonelyI am being abandoned since my childhood, my parents abandoned me , I was struggling and found the best friend of my life and almost after 10 years she passed away and now I am all alone , got no friends online or offline. I live alone had 2 dogs and they passed away too. Iâm self employed doing good with considerable work. During work I stay busy but after work tough life starts. Earlier I used to come home and my dogs would jump and hug me. And I was like wow my boys and now I donât have anyone to share my life with."
"I want to smash my car into a wall first thing in the morning.I'm tired of telling my story.

It has to do with Chester Bennington and Linkin Park.

I'm a young trans girl with world class musical skills who is adored by men around the world for my silly pink hair and pastel aesthetics.

The music I make is beautiful, energetic, complex, emotional, and important. But nobody cared.

I travelled across the country to start a band with ð. She abused me. She begged me to come live with her and do this band. Said she'd kill herself if I left her. I told her I didn't want a relationship with anyone except those who would form this band and travel with me.

She lied to me to get close to me, and has already made a plan to replace me. I never meant a thing to her, even though she said that I was the reason she realized she is transgender and all of her music was made because of that.

The police come looking for me every week or so because I call the suicide lifeline every day, desperate for my story to be heard. They want me to go to a psych ward and be tortured again. I think 13 times was enough.

All I wanted was to make this album and sing about the problem of suicide, and being transgender, and make the cutest, loudest progressive rock ever.

But nobody cares.

I did my best, and found out that I mean nothing to anyone. I am disposable at best and despised at worst.

The world doesn't need me. The message is loud and clear. My life doesn't matter.

Tomorrow I plan on doing what almost happened tonight. I'm going to crash my car inside a tunnel driving as fast as I can.

Why should I give these amazing gifts to a world that has tortured, abused, abandoned, and hated me for trying to speak up about what matters to me the most?

Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, and so many other rock stars died at this age - I'm 27. I didn't get to have their successes, but I understand that none of it was worth a thing to them. I get it. Life has nothing of value. I have felt the drive to end my life every single day since 2010. Instead of being taken with compassion, the world is reviled and disgusted at my honesty. I do not owe them my aura.

When I die, I will be forgotten. Nobody cares about transgender folk. We are not even second class citizens. We are subhuman. We are mistakes. Abominations. Mutants. Thousands of men want to add me on Facebook and flirt with me only because they think I'm a real girl. I'm not. I'm a tranny and a suicidal maniac.

There has never been anything in this life that has given me any hope, joy, comfort, or happiness. It has been a long, cold, dry, and rough stretch of grey concrete, that my long since dead spirit has been dragged down hundreds of thousands of miles in a despair of worthless failure. I am not loved or respected by anybody. My dearest friends will turn their backs on me in an instant, all because I am nothing but pain and dread to them. My love and affection are discounted and denied, instead I am merely an expression of suffering that deserves to be erased.

Nobody will notice when I'm gone, except that there will be a big sigh of relief across the whole world that there is one less negative creep out there.

I will be at peace, and so will everyone else. Suicide is the right thing to do, I simply have no choice."
"I'm so, so tired.I'm tired of waking up in the mornings and not being able to think about anything but killing myself. I'm tired all the goddamn fucking time. Sleeping doesn't make it go away. I don't want to sleep anymore, but all I have the energy for in the days is going back to sleep.

I don't know who I am anymore. I don't like myself. I just. I don't know. I want to be a different person, someone who could wake up and be happy without lying to himself. 

I don't know how to deal with life anymore. I don't want to. I don't want to wake up again another morning and spend the next four hours THINKING about suicide. I just want it out of my head, even if that means I'm going to die.

Please please please."

I feel so many things in my head right now, thinking of every happy moment that I ever had but I just can't with deal with the misery anymore.

So may I ask you, what keeps you alive? Anything at all that stops you from suicide?

"don't know where else to turn toI feel more hopeless than usual today. 

I feel like crashing my car somewhere. 

I'm so tired. 

I grew up with no family. As soon as I was born, my grandparents raised me and my mom left to another country. Age 10, my grandpa got shot (heard the shots blocks away), and so I moved to Canada with my mom and step dad and half brother. Was abused emotionally and physically for 8 years. Raped/lost virginity age 17 by stranger. Moved to America to pursue dreams, went through a very hard break up, got kicked out and was homeless and couch surfing for a year. Graduated last year at age 21, but now I can barely get a job cause of the job limits by visa. My visa ends this month. If I go back to Canada, I have to go back to my abusive family. I have no one to couch surf at cause I've left my life there. I have to start all over again after finally finding people I love in America. I don't want to force my current boyfriend to marry me for papers so I can work here. I'm about to turn 22. I'm falling back to depression. 

I feel more hopeless than usual today. 

I feel like crashing my car somewhere. 

I'm so tired. 

I'm writing my suicide note."
"Confused about gf Please read!!! My girlfriend started acting weird out of no where and I wanted to see if something like this has happened to anyone of you with your SO. I sent her a Snapchat and she responded with a joke. Then directly under it she said that she has been feeling weird lately and might not text me for a while, her feelings are all weird and she doesnât wanna mess this up. I asked for details or what was happening and she said it was hard to explain. She said that it didnât have to do with me she thinks. Sheâs just going to stop talking to people for a second. I said that I didnât understand what was happening and she said she didnât either. I then said I would give her as much time as she needs but just wanted to know that when she was ready to talk to me again we would be okay. She did not answer this question and simply stated that itâs okay and that sheâs okay. Then after I asked more questions she simply said I donât mean to sound mean but stop texting me. I then said Iâm always her for you and stopped texting. Iâm going to give her the space she clearly needs right now but Iâm just scared. I donât know why this is happening or what I can do to help. Any comments or suggestions will be seriously appreciated. Thank you."

"I freaking did it!!! My mother told us a couple weeks ago that we werenât celebrating Halloween. My spook vibes did not resonate with that.

We bickered and finally she said we could celebrate but she wasnât buying anything. So your boy went ahead and bought his 5 siblings their costumes along with one for himself. I also bought a large amount of candy so I can hide it around the house for the little gremlins to find. Then weâre gonna watch Halloween movies until we crash. Itâs a safe, fun, and non satanic Halloween and I planned it all on my own. I hope everyone has the spookiest of times. Stay safe and brush your teeth."

"Would love some realistic feedbackHey ya'll! This is going to be long and confusing, probably. I'm not redacting all of this. I'm writing as I go. Close this tab if you don't like reading a stupid story of someone who's acting like a total teenager at age 28.

Let's start with introductions in this rather dim-lit subreddit. I'm a 28 year old guy living in a popular tourist-trap capital in western Europe. I have a kick-ass job, great friends and a life generally envied by said friends, according to said friends. My colleagues are from all over the planet and incredibly fun to be around. My family is in relatively good health and my apartment is so kick-ass that I'm getting couchsurfing requests even though I'm not a member.

I'm also, according to online questionnaires anyway, depressed. Now, I've worked in healthcare. I don't trust those ""sit and talk"" people one bit. Nor do I trust their medications. So I am not even going to attempt that. I've seen it, I've reported over it, I don't want to be a part of it. I'm depressed. Yay. First step: complete. My name is [unknown] and I'm a depressed person.

Recently, my mood has gone from a 7 out of 10 to a solid 2 out of 10. I can't seem to enjoy *anything* anymore. My friends try to pull me out of my self-inflicted shell of distancing from them, but I really can't bring up the energy to even fake it. I'm stuck inside of my own head. All the good things aside: I'm so bored. I'm so incredibly apathetic towards everything. The only things that move me anymore are my friends and, to some extent, watching some tv-shows that I download.

None of my former hobbies (gaming, playing sports, etc.) matter anymore. I try, I really do, but they are boring now. I've always thought this was a mere ""growing up"" kind of symptom, not necessarily a sign of mental distress. But now I'm wondering... because I've been crying for about 5 hours straight. I swear to all that is good and awesome in the world: if I had a gun, I'd be dead right now.

I just don't see it anymore. I'm getting paid, then I spend money on rent, food, insurances, some ""fun"" here and there, and then it starts all over again. Is this the life I'm leading? Ah, mind you: this was last year's mindset. Since then, I've tried to kick my ass to get into the next gear and try things I never thought I'd do. I did some crazy shit, things that made me feel ""alive"" (try to understand the meaning behind this word) ever so slightly. And it worked, temporarily...

Until now. I've been crashing today. Just crying over my own fate. I'm single, my personality is too cautious to ever land a girlfriend that I'd acknowledge as someone that isn't merely settling. I'm honestly under the impression that any girl that likes me has bad taste, and I instantly dislike her in return.

The lack of love in my life is killing me. The loneliness is killing me. And though it's hard to understand: it's a choice, I can be around friends every day if I so please. I just... can't. It drains so much energy. The faking that I already do is making me physically ill. I'm currently at the point of wondering ""Why?"" -- what makes this all worth it? If I'm gone, a funeral/cremation will happen, and two weeks later every single person that attended it will be back at work. They'll have birthday parties. Life goes on.

I can't stand the thought of being lonely for the rest of this year, nor settling for someone just to escape that feeling. The few people I had an intimate connection with aren't interested in me in the way I'd like them to be. I can't imagine being 30 and still feeling this way. The easiest way out seems to be to just cave in to the temptation of nothingness. I actually have it all planned out: a sure-fire way of committing suicide. Not half measures. Instant death. 

But, of course there's a but, I'm posting here. I'm looking for positive advice from people more experienced. People who have gone through these motions. I really, really want to end this life. But I'm fully aware that suicide can be played out in more than one way: I just want to get rid of the current ""me"". I don't need to stop my heartbeat for it. I just want to be a better person...

So.

Here's something. I have a killing case of the ""afraid to commit""-ness. Additionally, I haven't known displays of love, ever. My parents never hugged or kissed anyone, not even me. This has hindered relationships all my life. I want to change, but I have absolutely no idea how. This is what I believe to be the basis of my state of mind... I've had plenty of relationships with the other sex, but I've never been able to actually make someone feel loved. I'm entirely incapable of it... and trust me: I'm a damn great actor when it comes to ""fake it till you make it,"" it just doesn't seem to work...

So in contrast to this subreddit: please, please... please help me kill the person that I am today, help me become a better person. Before I give up. Because I'm damn close to giving up by now. I need help from people. I don't need drugs. 

Thanks so much..."
"i cant control my anger !!!!hello guys/girls ! im not a born english speaker. so my english will have grammatical mistakes. but i ll try to explain this in a good manner. Do note that this is 100% real and i just wanted to tell this ...

 since i was little i was kinda antisocial and was afraid to go in to crowded places. and i have to tell you that i was shy too. my parents are just normal parents any one of you could have. although my dad was kinda strict when i do bad things(any dad is like this). but hes nice. its just he has a huge temper when i or anyone do anything wrong.(plz dont think my dad is abusing or anything. i love him so much.its just his temper is crazy). when i was in school i was kinda alone. i had friends and it was never hard nor easy to make friends. but i never did progressed with life like going to parties, study nights sort of things students do. and i liked to hurt little animals like kittens and chicks.(if i rememebr it right it was kinda an sudden impule a feeling i felt when i was a child :( but now i dont feel like this. i love animals and plants so much.i dont know what changed in me )things progressed and i stopped talking to people even best friends. its just i dont have anything to talk unless its a topic which i like. even with my family or my inner circle i always kept my silence until they speak about something. i wasn't that good with studies but i liked science and music(even now).i felt anger in these days but not in a huge rate like im feeling now.

 i grew up and now im 23 years old. after school i enrolled to a university(currently in my last year) and now im doing an internship in software eng. i somehow managed to talk with people now. its good and it wasn't like before. but i always felt an emptiness in my heart and when im alone i think about stuff which i wasn't able to do and what is worse is i always thought about what i dont have. for an example im short af ! im 5'2 and has 40kg weight. and i had this weight for over 5 years, i was slim always and never able to increase my height nor my weight or muscle mass. all of my friends are well developed they have nice body figures but i dont have.  i was depressed over this and about the fact why im not like other people..from age 21 i noticed my anger isn't normal. its so impulsive that i even do things which i couldn't believe. when im angry i dont blame others or fighting with anyone. i just keep it to myself. and to release the temper i break stuff. but i stopped doing this because i have broken over 3 laptops,2 mobile phones etc because of my temper and i cant always afford new one. so instead i try to hurt myself when ever im angry. i had a BIGG ANGER OUTBURST last 2 week i almost bite off the flesh from my inner forearm. it was painful and i think the bite force did something to a vein inside my hand and from that day my hand is still feeling numb in a some area. when in a huge anger outbursts im having this impulse to drive a knife over me or do a very serious damage to myself. so i will just hit my head or hit a wall until its over. its just so destructive and im doubting i can live with anyone like this. im afraid i will hurt someone badly because of my anger. the reason for anger is anything. if i cant do anything i get mad and the worst part is, it progresses. if i fail at a game (i played league of legends and recently i quited.), my anger will burst out like a raging fire. some ares in my body hurt because i hit them with my fist. i always feel very gloomy and sad. when im not with anyone i think abut alot and get depressed.when that happens i smoke. will this get worst? am i having a mental illness ? i need your opinion plz. 

PS : i smoke weed like everyday. not an alchol abuser. never did dangerous stuff like heroin or meth. But tried acid 3 times and all the 3 times i had good trips."

"Everyone has left or is leaving and I don't want to start again.I've had depression my whole life.  Unmedicated, I'm a slug.  Medicated, I'm a functioning robot.  I'm at functioning robot.  Suicide has always been a constant companion, like a long lost friend you hear from every once in a while to remind you they're present if you need them.  

My ""friends"" have all vanished, unhappy with their own lives and unwilling to share their time.  My roommates (practically family) don't care to talk or interact or do anything.  My girlfriend is so distant we hardly even talk anymore and our schedules let us see each other once or twice a week and she doesn't even seem to care anymore.  She's the only ray of light in an impregnable darkness and I can tell she's heading out.  My job is a physically destructive, mentally dulling, and the only thing I can find that actually lets me pay my fucking bills.  I'm going nowhere, there's nowhere to go and I can't see anything to do.  I know I can't start over.  These are the best friends I've ever had and they're practically gone.  I know this woman is the other half of my soul I've always searched for and she's disappearing.  I can't do it again.  I can't find more friends.  A new job.  A new life.  A new gal.  I hate being poor.  It's all too much work and failure to find some pretend fucking success that'll just melt once I think I'm doing ok finally.  I've never really seriously thought about it since I was a little kid living a fucked up little kid life and now...I really just don't want to struggle and fight anymore.  I can't.  I've been a fighter my whole life and I don't have anything left.  I can't come up with anything left.  I guess I just needed to vent, I've felt like this for weeks, if I talk to anyone irl they'll just put me on a psych hold and I'll miss enough work to not make rent.  My taxes are coming back and I've almost saved enough so I can leave my roommates enough for my share of the rest of the lease and be done.  Thanks for listening.  I hope whoever is reading can keep the strength they need because I ran out a while ago."
"This is it. Thanks for everything.[Dont bother and read all this, I just needed a place to write this down I guess]


Thanks for everything reddit, this is it, I am 23 and soon it will all be over.

This morning shortly after my mother and her boyfriend left with the dogs, without saying goodbye, as usual, I took my laptop, external HD, money and some papers and left. 
Left the few clothes I had behind, hated them anyways. I dont have much personal things or anything of value. The only things I have right now is my laptop, my phone, the clothes I wear, my car, ~â¬2000 and lots of debt. Tomorrow I am going to sell my car which should give me another â¬1000, go to the airport and take the next plane to, probably, Ibiza. Live there until I run out of money, rent a car, park it somewhere on a cliff watch my last sunrise and die. I am pretty excited tbh, this will be my first vacation is 7 years and I am going to fly for the first time in my life. Hopefully it is going to be the best time of my life so I will die at least somewhat happy.

I know, this is a pretty radical decision, but it is the best for everyone. There is no hope left for me. No amount of psychological help or drugs is going to fix me, make up for my messed up childhood, give me a loving family or the love I have never received, give me an college eduction, pay off my debt or all the other things I don't want to bother you guys with it really is too much to write down. I am not going to slave away at a job far below my potential or something like that. Not to sound arrogant but my survival instinct isnt that big I guess. 
The last 5 years have been hell, and it wont get any better soon, and even if the last 23+ years are going to haunt me for the rest of my life. I dont want to live a live I am not proud of anymore. I have suffered more than enough.
I hope the few friends I have will forgive me, planning to send them an apology letter but I am sure they will understand and can cope with it. I also hope that you guys find peace sometime, I know there is hope for many, if not the most, of you. 

I have another 24 hours or so to think all this through, but I am pretty confident that I made a decision, the right decision. 

Thanks for everything reddit, I wish you all the best, goodbye.

Where my cock gang at? The other chinese zodiac signs are losers
not suicidal but also not NOT suicidalI'm honestly at the worst point in my life so far. I'm a 16 year old girl and I just started my junior year online and I don't think I'm going to make it through. like not necessarily suicide but I have this feeling that something really bad will happen due to the stress. I'm mentally ill and stopped taking my medication at the beginning of summer and it destroyed me. I'm back on more two meds now but it's not helping and I'm just scared for myself. I've been fighting with my parents more and more and honestly I just want to die sometimes... I don't think I will do anything and I feel guilty just THINKING that because my best friend lost his father to suicide in may and it was really bad for him. Like I could never kill myself knowing that he would lose his best friend when he already lost his father. But yeah I just have this feeling I'm going to actually have a breakdown soon. sorry I'm rambling
"I was raped and I'm not dealing wellIt's been over a month and I can't take it. It's all I think about all the time and I don't want to talk to my friends about it because I know how hard it is on them but I also am afraid to be alone I don't want to be left alone because if I'm not focusing for one second.... It's all I can think about. He was my best friend, I trusted him. I'm so alone. I just want someone to hug me and tell me it's okay but it never will be. I just want this all over."
"How can I be happy, when no one wants me?I'm used to being ignored and rejected, that's all I've been my entire life. That doesn't hurt me anymore. What hurts is that nothing ever changes. Girls don't even look at me, not even if I accidentally trip in front of them. It's always strike up a conversation with a stranger/s, then get shut down some way a bit later in the conversation or she/they decide to leave. It's the same on the internet too, I send a polite message saying I would like to chat, and...no response. What am I doing wrong? I don't think I'm too forward, desperate, or obnoxious. I'm just your average nice guy looking for companionship. I even think I'm not that bad looking, imagine Andrew Garfield as a shorter, younger guy, that's kinda what I look like(loosely). I work out everyday, so I have the physique of a gymnast(again loosely). So what is it about me that girls hate? Am I just kidding myself? I see guys less attractive than me(in my opinion) with attractive girls, so why can't I? I've been at this for years, it's always the same. How can be happy knowing that no one wants to date me? I don't ever think about suicide, but if I were to die somehow any day now...I don't think I would mind. "
"Taking steps to incite a mob to beat me to death.I need to die in the worst way possible.  I believe in consequences and punishment.  I'm too much of a coward to do it myself, so I need someone else to do it for me.

A few weeks ago I was transported to a psych ward by police for the first time in my life.  I've been developing and practicing a new habit of trying to manipulate strangers into believing that I'm a monster who deserves to die.

My attempts over the past few weeks have been unsuccessful.  People just look at me like a lunatic.  I tried handing people $30 asking if they'd see if they could take me out in one sucker punch for the free money.  Nobody complied because I did it in a well-to-do town.

I know my next step.  I know where I need to go.  I know the type of people who will deal with me.  And I'm getting better at acting.  I'm discovering a talent for it.

I must get beaten or burned to death by a mob, or at least a few VERY ANGRY people.  It's not fair that it hasn't happened to me yet.  It needs to happen.

I'm a disgusting coward of the highest degree.  Someone who is plotting to get killed by an innocent person.  It's time to face my consequences.

I'm getting help.  I'm getting intensive therapy.  I've been to the ER.  The mental health bills are starting to pile up.  I'm going to lose my job soon as a result of all this anxiety.  It's time to die."
"You know how I knowThat my life is worthless and no longer worth living? 
One, I absolutely loved cooking and baking my entire life. The last year has completely taken that away from me. I don't have the money for a place to live let alone food.
I have no desire to lift a finger to cook anything anymore. I used to feel great preparing my kids delicious and really healthy meals every single day, every single meal. Right now, I don't remember the last time they had something I wouldn't normally consider crap.
All I think about is killing myself. I have completely detached from my children who I used to love so much. Now I look at them and I don't feel anything. I still want what is best for them, but I just don't feel anything. 
Having worked my whole life for everything I had and asking my friend to store it for me until I found a place turned out to be a mistake. He ruined everything in less than a month. Literally everything I owned is now trash you see out at most garage sales. Now, if I ever do find another place I have to start completely over. Shit that took me 15 years to get is going to take another 15 years of my life to build up.
I have not been patient with my kids. Homelessness is destroying who I was. I feel sorry for them but no matter how hard I try I can't treat them right anymore. I want to die for their sake. I don't want to affect their mental health for their entire lives because of this. 
All I want is a place to live. Is working two jobs not enough? When did literally killing yourself working become not good enough to have a home? I guess I'll never be good enough. I can't do this any more. I am literally killing myself trying to get somewhere and am getting no where at all. Everyday seems to just get worse.
I used to want the least painful way to die, but now, want the most painful thing I can possibly put myself through. I apparently deserve this."
"Hey you wanna know what's really gross but also surprisingly arousing? Having a girl stick your fingers in your mouth

No joke. Basically at camp I kinda hooked up with a girl, and luckily the one night we were together was the night that we watched a move in the planetarium (space camp) so anyway, one thing turns into another and we were making out

So anyway it was nearing the end of the movie and I put my arm around her, playing with her shirt and stuff

And this girl trucking grabs my hand and stuffs three of my fingers in her mouth and starts licking them.

Anyway that's how the last week on July went for me lol"
"Messed up in the head.I am crushed. Finally can confirm that I am fucked up in the head.
I have had one police visit me to see if I am alright, I was at the time. Now I am seriously considering hospitalization.

The good news is I have enough experience to feel confident about writing but was that worth it. I got the person who liked me to hate me. I just need to wait until I can die in a place where she won't hear any news. Both so she won't get any more hurt than she is now. 

With my intelligence and personality I may have a good future if I bet on that but I don't care. I have never added up. I have always been useless. I have always tried to emulate. Now that I have something of my own, something to keep and derive a source of materials for fuel, I don't need to emulate so much but was it worth it.

First was earning emotions worth it? was earning content in my heart worth it? I am messed up and need people to talk to."

"I hate acne Both of my cheeks have acne and so does some of my forehead. Itâs typically always been my cheeks but since Iâve been under an overwhelming amount of stress lately itâs affected my forehead as well. 

My face hasnât been clear in over a year now. Some days look better than others. It also depends on how much water I drink which helps and taking a shower makes it look smoother. 

Iâm 18 almost 19 now and have been struggling with acne since I was 13. No one else has acne my age. People who donât struggle with acne are so lucky."
"today is my lastiâm at work right now, i donât want to be. my heart is aching too hard for this to last much longer. the person my mom loves isnât real, iâm not real. iâm gonna go home tonight and take as many random pills as i can. the notes are already written. i am okay with this one being the end. that is okay."
"My sister made my lip bleed and got off scot free. I was making fun of a show she was watching, and so she decided that a good response was to kick at me. 

This made my phone fly into my face, and my lip met my tooth. It bled, and I grabbed her and said that if she did it again, that I would hurt her back. We go talk to my parents and she makes it sound like I was super aggressive. 

I wasn't and I made my case. And to be fair, I mouthed off a tad bit. But other than that, my mom said that I'm not a kid anymore (keep in mind I'm 15) I say that my sister isn't either and my mom says that she's 13. Thir-fucking-teen. It says it in the word. Teen. I point this out and my parents considered it backtalk. My dad even said he would punch me in the mouth if I ""mouthed off"" again. 


I fucking hate my sister. She makes my life a slog to go through and I've honestly considered killing myself. I won't, don't worry about that. I've got people that need me, so I have to live for them. But my sister is so awful, she made me forget that. 
Thanks for letting me rant. Have a good one."
"Hey fellow Redditors, I'm feeling super down for some reason. Details belowI posted an IAmA a couple of days ago about being 17 with my substance abuse problem. I'm slowly waning myself off of them. I haven't really been craving coke or alcohol and I'm feeling good and I never really though of it as an addiction. I would stop months at a time but when I did it I did th in excess I don't know. 
I've been wrestling with depression for 2 years since my sophomore year in high school. I've attempted twice and failed both times. I just get in these spouts were I just think about how pointless things are and how bored I am and how sometimes I just want something spectacular to happen but I know it won't and seeing a point to go on gets hard. I think I'm mostly depressed is because my mom this morning basically told me I just needed to ""snap"" out of it and bring god into my life because that's why I'm so sad and that I bring this on myself for surrounding myself with ""bad spirits"" and how I'm not really depressed. I've battled self harm and I fucked up and gave in and sliced my upper arm up pretty bad and now I feel like I can't stop. I'll just sit and cut until I can't feel anything. 
Growing up, I felt really ignored because my mom was always busy with my older brother and his mistakes that I went unnoticed and my dad wasn't in my life a lot. And I realized the more I achieve the more attention I'd get so I tried to be perfect at everything and started abusing coke to help me stay up at night and do weeks of homework in a small amount of time. I clearly remember getting a B on a paper and just feeling worthless and sitting in my room and slicing into my arm for 2 hours. 
It's not like I'm some loner or anything but I just feel like all of my friendships and relationships are so fucking shallow and how no one really knows me and I just feel really alone. 
I fucking hate talking about this because I'm a guy and self harm has always been categorized as being a girly thing so I just feel embarrassed. 
I feel like if I killed myself everyone would be shocked because I don't show it and I'm so happy but it's all a facade. I feel like I'm wearing masks because inside I don't know how I feel just numb and empty

Sorry for babbling, I just need someone to talk too. Distract me from cutting tonight. Maybe a guy who's dealt with self harm? It doesn't matter though just need a distraction. You can ask me anything. "
"Teacher keeps broadcasting grades for everyone to see Ok so I have this teacher and like EVERY class she decides that yay I need to grade while Iâm screen-sharing/broadcasting. So she shows everyone their grades in her grade book and is doing it on purpose. It makes us feel all very uncomfortable. Grades are private. 

I know itâs not allowed because ANOTHER teacher did the same thing and got in trouble. But this one does it every. single. class. She shows us her grading, her going through her online grade book, her implementing HW grades and just stuff we shouldnât see. Itâs embarrassing. I personally usually get 100s on my stuff in her class but then I see other peopleâs grades and theyâre like lower than expected and I can see on zoom that people are embarrassed and uncomfortable. She only turns screen-sharing off when sheâs freaking DONE! She KNOWS itâs on but doesnât turn it off until sheâs DONE. I donât know what to do because itâs just uncomfortable. Any advice? 

Iâm zoom only so I really canât tell her anything privately. And sometimes she just moves out of site of the zoom camera to deal with her in person students. I canât really do anything myself but maybe I could tell a friend?"

"Why Does Help Only Exists For Some People?I really want to scream. I feel like Kitty Genovese right now. A lot of people know Iâm suicidal but do not care. People see me write disturbing things on my Facebook wall and scroll by as if itâs nothing.

I have no real friends. My family has been dead for years. I hate it when strangers say âif you take your life youâll be hurting the people around youâ.
Hurting WHO? I demand to know.
In the four years of battling cancer not one person has visited me at the hospital. Not one person accompanied me to a doctorâs appointment. If they were real friends why would they isolate me like this?
Is this how caring people act?

If it is Iâm so sick of this World. I canât stand it if everyone is like this.

I reached out to over a hundred suicide prevention organizations. All of them refused to help me. If they did respond they all gave out that same 1-800-273-8255 Suicide Prevention Hotline thatâs always jammed and when you do actually get through arenât very helpful and rush you. Same goes for the 741741 Crisis Text Line.
Many of these organizations accept HUGE donations. Makes me wonder where all that money is going to if they canât help you personally and have to direct you to that only one number or text line. 

God I feel so helpless! Iâm trying so hard but not getting anywhere.

I contacted organizations in different states. I got in touch with many facilities. I have insurance. NOTHING! 
All the psychiatrist offices I called are no longer accepting patients. Many places are booked - and again just give me that same number I have been given a hundred times.

This really isnât fair. In the past I have helped friends through breakups and abusive relationships. Helped financially with car payments, rent, utilities, vet expenses but where is everyone now? 
I didnât help them to expect something in return but Iâm really down and Iâm really needing a helping hand out of this black hole and no one will help me.

I donât know what to do anymore. Where do I reach out? Iâm lost. Iâm in so much panic.

This world is uncaring and cruel. Help seems to exist for some people but not for EVERYONE.

Wheverer forum, social media site, or page I post on I would see others in my similar situation reaching out for help and being ignored. How many of those people ended their life? 
There is the proof everywhere people ignore it. And then they ask âwhy didnât they give us a warning?â They did all over the place you just choose to turn the other way!
The thousands of suicide awareness pages are useless. When an actual suicide person comes along they just make the excuse theyâre just spreading awareness not there to help people. 

There was a guy in a different country who posted he wanted to carry out a shooting because women ignored him and he was bullied at school and Facebook did NOTHING. Got the automated âthis doesnât violate guidelinesâ message. 

Iâm not sure if posting here will make any difference but I want to keep trying. Maybe one person will listen and be able to help me. I want help so desperately!"

"Im too weakNo matter how much I think about commiting suicide, I never can go through with it. I think about cutting my veins and downing all my pills but I never do.

I've held a knife in my hand and brought it to my arm. Nothing. 

I'm too weak to die, yet I'm too weak to live too. Everyday I go through life, sometimes okay, sometimes I feel as though no one gives a shit. I talk to friends and family and I know that if I told them they would never understand. 

I feel so alone, and I feel worthless. Like nothing matters anymore. Like I dont matter anymore. It feels as though I could die today and no one would notice or care enough. 

I was absent from school one day. A few people texted. When I didn't respond, I got nothing else. No more messages. No phone calls. Nothing. 

I could have died, and no one would have noticed until it was too late.

Thanks for listening to my ramblings, I guess. "

"Feeling like I already failed at life and fear of seeking helpHello , sorry to bother but I'm having some trouble to choose if I should seek help from a specialist.

I've always been quite a sad person who is most of the time alone and I acknowledged that I'll never be really happy since I'm 14 but since my grade were correct I just tried to cop with life and waited for everything to goes better . 

But this year I just entered a preparatory school and I'm failing hard (I must be one of the last if not the last of my class ) and I just can't endure failure , feeling like the worst and dumbest person in life , being a wasted life. Now I just can't work because I just don't feel like wanting to do anything.

I have some problem of self esteem and started to isolate myself from other because everyone their are way more better than me , feeling like I disgust everyone. This lead to me being alone for another year.
Because of all that I  feel like I already failed at life and I have absolutely zero futur.

I already had suicidal though since two years because of loneliness
but by adding that with failure and anxiety about my futur I tried to kill myself for real this time. As you can see it was a failure but because of that for the the first time I tried to spoke with one of the only friend I have about that even though I never speak about my problems to others.

He advised me to go seek help to a profesional , but I really don't know if I should.
I'm really not close to my parents and I don't want them to be bothered by that but I'm pretty sure if I speak about suicide he'll have to tell them. Living by antidepresant to be somewhat happy is also scarrying me
The last thing I'm scarred about is being hospitalized after reading many stories about that.
Also , I feel like I'm faking it , I'm not trully depresed / suicidal , I just seek attention and want to find and excuse for being such a failure. I'll just bother everyone by being so egoist.

Thanks a lot for reading this and sorry for all the grammar mistake  / bad english."

"Can someone talk pleaseNew here because i feel no where else to go. When someone says they have no one, that is me x100. Well death follows me. My best friend died in 2016, 2 friends died in 2017. The pain has made me push my remaining friend and family all out of my life because i am very introverted with my emotions. Now i am alone. Completely alone. Ironically years ago i imagined myself as being ok with being completely alone (because i am very introverted) but I take that back. I have so much pain brewing deep in me and sometimes it just hits like a train. All at once just throws me into a deep depression with this weird feeling like i am completely detached or already dead. No one has helped me with the grieving. I never had shoulder to cry on or anything so that has made me very cold and bitter and everything is just internalizing in me.
 I wish that i had died with one of my friends and at this point i feel like that is the thing that would make me happiest is to die. No one would even be at my funeral. I am not kidding about that.  The line ""think about loved one"" doesnt work because i have none. This realization is so hard my chest hurts just wondering if anyone wants to talk I think I need that or i will do nature a favor and just rid myself"
"I think my friend (F) is being used by her boyfriend (also friend) to get closer or to make my other friend (Also F) jealous. Ok, ok I know thatâs a lot but hear me out

The boyfriend (whom Iâm going to name David) moved to my school about 2 weeks ago. David already knew one of my friends (the one I believe heâs trying to make jealous), who Iâm going to call Alisha.

How do Alisha and David know each other? Well they went to the same primary school together, and they both got in contact with each other around last year. David had a crush on Alisha, and there was some feelings there from Alisha too. They never really ended up together, but they were acting like they were boyfriend and girlfriend, and Alisha ended it because she was getting uncomfortable.

Anyway, fast forward a year, David moves to our school (NOTE: it wasnât because of Alisha, he has problems at his old school). On his third day, he meets my other friend, who Iâm going to call Jemimah. 

I know for a fact that Jemimah and Alisha are close, and Iâm pretty sure that Alisha told David that as they are friends and she was informing him on her friends and stuff (I know that she told him about me) so he knows who everyone is.

Anyway, getting back to the story, according to Jemimah they got talking in class and David said they should hang out after school one time. Iâm pretty sure that afternoon, David asks Jemimah out on a date. David told lots of people he was going on a date, including me, and Iâm sure one of those people he told was Alisha. To me he didnât say who, so I assume to Alisha it was the same.
After their date, Jemimah told me that they are a couple, and I believe they were going way to fast. Like, they just met, and they are already together. Doesnât that seem suspicious??

Now why do I think David is using Jemimah to get closer/make Alisha jealous? Well I have multiple ideas. 

1. Iâve notice that David acts the same around every girl, including Jemimah (Iâve noticed that he doesnât really act all excited or happy around Jemimah)
2. He talks way more to Alisha than Iâve seen him to Jemimah.
3. He knows that they are close friends.
4. David legit asked Alisha if she wanted to come with them on his and Jemimahâs date (she didnât go).
5. He doesnât act all boyfriendy around Jemimah (MEANING: Iâve never seen him hug, hold hands, or do anything like a boyfriend would do with Jemimah)
6. Legit after meeting each other they end up together. That seems way to suspicious.

Can you see what I think here? My point is, I believe that David still has some feelings for Alisha, and obviously he wants to be in a relationship with her, so heâs using Jemimah until he gets his way (which will probably be never).

I think this is the wrong sub to post this on but oh well I need to hear your opinion on this."
the only logical solution is to kill myselfbut iâm such a coward. i usually just get high until i pass out so i donât have to deal with myself until the next night. tonight feels like a confirmation of my suspicions. iâm a failure and iâm going to die a failure. 
I canât decide. I canât make up my mind if I want to try and find someone or if I should just leave my life as it is. Itâs really starting to bother me and Iâm at the end of my rope with this.
"Iâve started crying in classI havenât seen my real friends in a long time. I donât think they are my friends anymore. I donât know if I want friends anymore. One of my teachers noticed me crying in class, but thankfully didnât call attention to it. Sheâs trying to help me, but she reminds me of my stepmother who abused me and it makes me more anxious. Iâm afraid of driving because it would be so easy to end it. When people smile around me it makes me want to puke. Two people were laughing about something in front of me in line for lunch.

"why can't i just dielast week i took fifteen paracetamol pills and then four more but i didn't die... why? today i took four and i felt nauseous already &amp; i don't even know why. it's national best friend day, some social media trend i know but i have no one to honor because i lost the two best friends of my life at the start of the year when they chose to leave me. my other best friend who is my boyfriend we just argued again and i keep on thinking back to how he wants to be friends w this girl so desperately to the extent of sacrificing our relationship. but i love him so much. we always argue. my studies are shit and i'm not even half good at my sport. and idk i really have nothing to live for. i dont know how to make friends anymore, how to keep a meaningful conversation going, i am not funny or friendly or nice. i am not a good person basically. i used to be so outgoing and fun and hilarious and now i am just a shell of a person. i dont deserve to live."

"There's only one reason I haven't killed myself yet, and it's not a very good one. (CW: rape)When I was 17, I was raped.  He was my boyfriend at the time.  He'd done something, asked if it was ok if he slept with someone else on his upcoming 18th birthday, or something like that, and it had disgusted me.  I didn't want to have sex with him that night, but ""no"" was not an answer he liked to hear.  Previously, when I'd said ""no"", he just got me drunk, but that night he just kept pushing and pushing until I gave in, because I felt like I had to.

I had a history of being abused before that.  My family was not a good one.  He knew this.  He had also systematically isolated me from all of my friends.  He knew there was nobody else in my life, and he knew that gave him power.
I cried the whole way through, and even though he didn't ""finish"", because ""it really started feeling like I was raping you, and I'm not a rapist"", that didn't erase the previous... fifteen or so minutes, if I remember correctly.  He didn't stop for me.  He stopped for his own self-image.

To this day, he is the only person I have had sex with, willingly or otherwise, and that's the only reason I haven't killed myself yet.  I don't want to die knowing he was the only person ever to have fucked me, it feels like he's winning.  Especially since it's been over half a decade since it happened, and I've still not been able to be with someone else.

I feel like that's slowly becoming less and less of a concern though.  Nobody would want me now anyway.  I have no life in me, there's nothing about me that would attract another person.  I recently realised, after spending several months without any of my friends contacting me, that I could literally have already been rotting and nobody would have noticed.

I don't know why I've not done it.  Maybe I'm scared of the pain of failure."
"I want to dieI want to die so bad, everything hurts. I can't trust my feelings with anyone except strangers on the internet, because when I tell people that i feel bad, they go away.

I'm 22 years old and fairly attractive . My first relationship failed but I thought I'll find someone better . Then I briefly dated a friend who dumped me before new year this year . Then i was ghosted by an online date but that didn't bother me at all . So, this guy I knew from my past reappeared in my life and we started dating but he ghosted me . 

And i feel particularly bad because we know each other and he just disappeared and wouldn't take my calls , wouldn't see my texts. I deleted his number and blocked him.  At first i felt happy and relieved but then a heavy fog of sadness lingered over me and now I wish I could end it all .

I feel utterly hopeless and sad and I'm very much bothered that out of all ppl he decided to ghost me . We were more than lovers , he could've have just said he didn't want to date me anymore but instead he just disappeared from my life . 

I can't seem to find anything that would comfort me and I am in extreme distress ."

"Not making plans for the future to keep the option openI've been mildly depressed for years and I've been in a bad place for a few months now.  
I've paused my studies at university, started therapy and I'm just trying to get through one day at a time.

Usually I make some kind of commitment (concert tickets, helping out at an event of my students' union, making holiday plans with booked flights, etc.) a few months ahead and keep myself going that way.  
But I don't want that anymore. It just makes me feel like I only force myself to live without even wanting it.

After my sister's wedding next week (which is the one thing that kept me going for the last 8-9 months) I don't have anything I firmly committed to go to. And I'm avoiding making plans with others any further ahead.  
I haven't made plans to commit suicide either, but the idea is there. And I don't think I'm ready to give up on the opportunity and commit to keeping on living."
"Techno-failsAnyone else feel like technology failures play a huge part in their suicidality?

I feel like if the makers of technology realized what a trigger this can be, maybe theyâd make it suck less?"

"I need to tell you something awesome that happened today. So me and mah friends were playing a game (not a video game but something you'd play outside) where you needed to collect certain things until the time is out and then we'd all go to a table and then there was a boss. So it works like this: the things we find have a ""damage"" value and how often it can be used. Using different items in certain a certain order would Increase the damage amount.
Then there is a person behind the table who takes a card from many, and looks how much ""hp"" and ""boss damage"" is on it. He can't tell the players of course. 
I won't explain it more because it's very complex and hard to explain so yeah here's the story.


So you can lose if you touch sun light before the time is out. Well I ducked up. If you ducked up, then you could still watch the other players but you need to go unnoticed.

So I spectated my crush and gave her hints to where she'd need to go for certain powerful items. Without her seeing or hearing me of course.
Then an idea came to my mind: there was an abandoned little hut in the near my spot, so I ran there and scribbled ""I love you &lt;3"" on the floor.
Then I lured her into that hut and because she assumed it was me (she spoke her thoughts out loud and probably saw me when accidentally touching the light), she said ""I love you too!"" And left a note to meet me later in this hut again.
The expression of hers and just everything made me feel so loved.









Well it was just a dream but damn, those emotions I had were so sick. I just want to meet her in my dreams again."

now today, iâve been kicked out of the online school because iâm fucking stupid and canât do it and no one helps. i canât go back to public school and now i just have to hope some other online school lets me join. probably not. not really sure what the other options are. i guess drop out and explain to my family why iâm such a fuck up? cant wait for that conversation. or kill myself. suicide really sounds like the only thing that will help me. fml."

"Quick psych tip for your personal life Med student and hopefully future psychiatrist here. 

While doing some studies I was reminded of the jdea of problem based coping and emotion based coping.

I know when I was a teenager (and hell even through undergrad and now) I misused these.

For example:

Emotion Based Coping: eating icecream and playing video games after a break up because it makes you feel better.  - good use of emotion based coping

Problem Based Coping: working on a project your stressed about to get it out of the way to relieve your stress. - good use of problem based coping

However, I find myself doing this often:

Emotion Based Coping: Eating Ice cream and playing video games to deal with the stress of a project I need to do.  - bad use of emotion based coping

Problem Based Coping: working on trying to get my ex back after a break up. - bad use of problem based coping.

I recommend being able to identify what problem your facing and deciding what is the proper way to handle it, it will save you a lot of frustration later and make you handle problems much easier."
"I envy ppl who kill themselvesI think about it lots but can never go throw with it.

"I can't handle this anymore.When I was 4-7 my grandfather was sexually and physically abusive, even going as far as raping me twice.

I've been struggling with untreated Dissociative Identity disorder and PTSD. I've tried to tell my mom about my anxiety and suicidal thoughts but she won't listen, she calls me an attention whore and a failure. I can't talk to my dad about it because I have a hard time talking to men especially in person due to my PTSD. Im so anxious I can hardily even function, I'm failing all my classes and I have literally no friends. I've not told anyone about the rape or abuse because nobody will believe me and it was years ago so there is no proof. Even if I do get help I don't think I can be fixed at this point. I just want to end it all. If I keep my secret I'm just gonna keep destroying myself but if I tell my secret my family will be destroyed and It will be my fault."

"Pretty much done.[Really long, might not be clear, sorry. I'm not exactly in a good state of mind to be typing out my thoughts right now, so please do forgive me.]


I just turned 16 last October 30. Being raised by a single mother (teacher and soon-to-be principal), living in a house with a really loving and caring family (grandma, grandpa, uncle). Now that we've got formalities out of the way, let's get into the shit.

I was a token student. A kid everyone knew as ""that one smart kid"" or someone with unlimited career opportunities. My depression actually started 6th grade, which sounds weird but hear me out. After the shit I witnessed with my mom and dad arguing all the time when I was still a kid, I turned my attention to reading magazines and huge books on planes, trains, cars and more to get my mind off of the arguments that made me worry. I figure that's how I became so mature at that young age, and also how I became so smart. However, I was and still am an introvert, I suck at talking to people and I always make things so awkward during conversations. For reasons unknown, I was bullied throughout 6th grade... And it continued until the end of middle school (which was actually my best time in school).

Come freshman year of high school, I continue to do well, which is fine, and my depression is still there but I wasn't suicidal. Sophomore year is when everything went to shit.

Now sophomore year I overwhelmed myself with all these honors and AP classes - I was up past midnight doing homework almost daily, which I could manage. What was really shitty though was not the AP classes, but it was in fact Chemistry and Algebra 2. My algebra 2 teacher didn't know how to teach and really shouldn't be a teacher; she did not help me understand anything at all, even in tutoring. My chemistry teacher was a total douchebag and I was too afraid to ask him anything, even in tutoring for the fear of being wrong and the fact that he practically called me stupid in front of the class 3rd quarter.

Each progress report I got that year was pretty bad. I got yelled at by my mom and I cried and I cried, and prayed to God that things would get better. Things didn't get better at all, and I ditched praying. I felt my family getting farther away from me, like I was a disappointment, something really bad in an Asian family like mine. Because of this, I punched myself in the nose every day to bleed without cutting myself.

My final grades were really bad. The only classes I failed were Algebra 2 and Chemistry, both with D+'s. To top it off, my chemistry teacher put in a comment on my grade saying ""Great student/credit to class."" I was brutally devastated and I cried hysterically every night. I don't even know if I can go to a university or join the USAF anymore, and if so, might as well end it now.

Come junior year (now!) and things are a bit better grade wise (even though I get yelled at for having a B+) but there's this thought at the back of my head that nothing matters anymore. Even if I get a good grade now, my future is still dull due to my performance from sophomore year.

Then I have some other problems. I feel like a fucking loser. My friends don't feel like friends anymore, I was backstabbed by two girls I was friends with (not girlfriend), which just happened recently so I am still pretty fucking down. I feel like a lot of people distance themselves away from me because of how negative and gloomy I am, and I'm just an all around awkward person to be around and to talk to. I guess people look at me as ""that weirdo"".

I look at couples in hate. I look at people who have awesome 4.0+ GPAs in hate. I look at happy people in hate. I hate successful people... I guess I hate everyone.

Speaking of couples, one of the girls that backstabbed me went behind my back saying that she wasn't interested in having a boyfriend when she told me she liked me (pretty contradictory, I know) and went to homecoming with one of my friends. I'm no longer friends with her, even though she thinks we still are friends.

Now I have standards for girls, and I have my eyes set on this really nice Asian girl who sits by me in two classes. Token student, professional, knows what she's doing, fun to talk to despite my awkwardice and nervousness. Knowing my luck, I'll never have her though, and besides, I've never had a girlfriend before.

In conclusion, I guess this was sort of a rant about my life. I don't even think I made any points clear. All I can say is that all of the problems I stated above are really hitting me now, and I think it's time to end things. I really have no purpose of being here, nor do I think I'll become anything I want to be in the future.

In the end, it's me against the world, and I'd say the world won."
"To live or to not to?I've had two unsuccessful suicide attempts in my past and was made to attend a session by my school, reached out to my parents and friends whom still think I'm putting up an act.
I don't have anyone to trust and talk too, life's been miserable since. My family hardly talk to me and all the people around me are good at avoiding me. Spent my days in quarantine alone in a room with my thoughts and came up with a conclusion that my life has, has been and will be pointless.

So my decision is to put myself out of misery.

I'm sorry if I rambled for too long I just needed to say this to someone rather than to a wall."

"I used to view suicide as a kind of punishment, as a moment of significanceIt was for the people around me. To finally show them what I really had inside. To make them feel my pain. I wanted to know how they'd react, to see if anybody even cared that I had killed myself. I think I wanted validation, maybe I wanted to know that people actually did care about me, I don't know. Anyhow, that's all gone now. I don't really care who knows I killed myself, or why. I don't really care how anybody will react. I see it as a milestone more than anything. I've finally reached the point where I stopped fighting. It's an expectation, not a decision. I will eventually leave, and it will be my choice."
"So here is a note.I'm hanging myself in about two seconds after I post this everything thing will go numb and I'll seize to exist. Fuck you joe. Fuck your dumbass family. Fuck the time I wasted with you, fuck this whole life"
Im down to my last option.My life is so pointless. Im never going to akount to anything. I cant handle being this stressed out. I took some pills im really afraid to be alone right now
How did I get here I truly don't know. My life is totally different to how I remember it... when did I change like this? How did this happen to the world? Why am I weaker and fatter? What's wrong with my hip? I can't remember

"Offing yourself isn't that easyPlanning to off yourself is annoyingly intricate. You have to figure out where and how and when. Where can you go that no one you care about will find you, but someone else will. How are you going to do it? You've Google searched ""Least painful ways"" but where will you get the supplies and how will you keep anyone from finding out? 

The most complicated piece to me is when. Should you do it before or after your family vacation? You wouldn't want to ruin it for everyone, but it seems phony to go along. Do you have enough money saved up so your husband can still pay the rent for a while? You did just sign a new lease last month. Do you have time to touch base with the people you'll miss the most and let them know how special and important they are to you. 

Should you write a note? If it doesn't work are you prepared to live on under worried, watchful eyes and heavy prescription that makes you feel even emptier than you already are? 

You don't know how people can just pick a day and step off the side of a bridge.

You keep telling yourself, ""Next week is the week. No more procrastinating. It's not rocket science."" 

In the end you'll probably just postpone it a little longer. Not because you're afraid to do it, you're not. You're just to afraid to leave any burden on all the hearts left behind.

"Getting the motivation to do something with my lifeI have chronic depression, social anxiety and a life long lack of motivation. I thought when I started getting a passion for weightlifting that I would be set back on the right track (and I felt like I was for awhile) but Ive gone to the gym like 5 times this entire year. I took time off from school to get better, to get treatment, but it only made me more depressed and isolated.

Now I'm in a situation where I haven't made a new friend in years, I've been single my entire life, I'm going to a new school soon even though social anxiety makes school such a miserable experience. 

I was trying to read those motivational posts and watch those videos. It sucks because I know that the only way to turn my life around for the better is to start being proactive about it, but I just can't convince myself that its even worth it. I've been depressed for so long that it's become a part of me, and its almost like I'm addicted to being depressed.

At this point the effort it would take to even put me in a slightly better place seems so insurmountable that I can't stop thinking about how much easier it would be to kill myself. I just have no desire to do anything at all or become anything. Fuck its tough because its not like I want to die, but at the same time I don't have any desire to better my life. Then when I think about how lucky and sheltered I am, it's make me feel like I'm just a ranting, entitled manchild or something."

"LostI first became depressed at the age of 6 or 7 and had mentioned suicide to my mom sometime around my 8th birthday. Iâm 22 now and suicidal thoughts have always been scratching in my mind. I hear âkill yourselfâ literally spoken in my head so many times every day. I have a family that loves me but I have no emotional connection with any of them, though I do feel some sort of love or responsibility for them. Iâve distanced myself from them unintentionally over the last 10 years from extreme anxiety and how I seem to explode on them when I become stressed.

I started to get to know this girl, long distance, I know, but there was a real connection. I ruined it with my commitment issues and anxiety to meet her. Thereâs a little more to it than this but Iâm not good at expressing my feelings and especially writing them. 

I donât know what more there is to say. I started taking Zoloft, I feel different but not better. The thoughts and feelings are still there but I feel completely frozen and suppressed when they come on hard.

I guess this is my cry for help, my other cries havenât been enough and I feel physically unable to reach out to someone in person. I feel embarrassed or that Iâm overreacting.

"Drinking Makes me Want to Kill MyselfI often times find myself at home alone while my wife is at work in the evening, sometimes when this happens I will go out to dinner with other friends or family and inevitably have a few drinks.  This is all fine and well when I am around them, but as soon as I am home alone while drunk my thoughts will inevitably, as they are at this moment, turn to the idea of how I can quickly and painlessly kill myself.

I love my wife and my family, but I get so depressed that all I can think about sometimes, especially while drunk, is how the fuck I can end it all with the minimum of pain and suffering so I can just die and not worry about how it may end up feeling painful.

This scare and concerns me, I love my wife and family and don't want to be without them, but I also just want the depression and sadness to be over so I don't have to sit and cry about stuff."

"To the teenage girls out there.. Look, I follow a few girls on insta and most of them post these photos with short shorts, very short shirts or even bikinis.

I don't know if it's you thinking the ""hotter"" you look in pictures the more likes you will get or what, but please don't do it if you don't want to. If it's to look good for boys, most of us prefer a normal photo without all the make-up and without all the skin showing. In fact, all that makes us less attracted to you if anything. 

So please, don't do all this bullshit for likes, follows etc. Just be yourself, that's all we want. Not all this flashy shit. Rant over, have a good day."

"Poor Review at WorkI've gotten home from work early after being spoken to by management about how poorly I've been performing. Also, many staff have complained about me, and examples of my poor performance were provided. I don't know how to go back to work on Tuesday and share an office with my coworkers. It broke my heart to hear that so many coworkers have made complaints against me. I feel nauseous. 

I spoke to my parents on the phone but it made me feel more anxious. I feel so trapped and there is no solution for me. Some people glide through life like they were given a textbook when they were born but I'm the opposite. I struggle with my anxiety and depression at every turn and it hurts so much to be me. 

I was holding a knife to my sternum and was wishing for the blade to just slide into me like butter. I'm scared and so alone.

"Hey guys I hope you can help me. I'm 22, I like science, and I live in the south.I have a weird situation and I know that I have depression just based on my belief but seeing a professional will say oh here are some pills to make you feel better. I feel like a professional will just try to fix me physically and mechanically. My real problem is something philosophical. It's like a need some kind of philosopher to tell me how to cope just from the perception of reality I am experiencing. Or just someone to agree with me and says, ""ya man, you need to get the hell out of there and run as far away from that place as you can."" NOBODY has ever told me too and I'm getting scared like everyone is infected with indoctrination and I can't do anything about it. 

Where I'm from I have to wake up everyday and lie to myself and say I believe in talking snakes and people walking on water just so I can feel somewhat sane. I'm sorry I'm just using my logical brain that God gave me. Do I have to go to my psychologist and tell him I don't believe in talking snakes or that I don't believe in a virgin birth? It scares me because I'm 22 and I feel like I'm not even grown up yet and my parents are 50-60 years old and they believe in the religious stories and go to church every weekend. They constantly talk about how non religious people are the worst kind of people. They always tell me how much my they hated them when they were growing up. All my friends except for 1 is religious. 

I'm telling YOU there is absolutely no diversity where I'm from, which gives the question... Do people think for themselves? Is everyone just scared of death and they'll believe anything they hear just to cover up death as if it's not there? it's so eerie to me to think that everybody is infected with the ideas of early human prehistory and nobody knows. 

Please tell me this isn't actually happening... I feel like I'm in a bad dream or something. Like I don't know why I feel so consciously aware of what's going on. What the hell is my problem? Am I crazy for loving how the world naturally works? Am I not supposed to? Why would God create the dinosaurs? Why would he make it look like the universe is expanding? Why would he make the distance of stars billions of miles away instead of 6 thousand? Why would he make the human genome 98% identical to chimpanzees genome? Why would he make the crust of the earth layer by layer with single cells at the bottom reptiles in the middle and mammals at the top? (And it's like that everywhere on earth) Why did he put almost every hominid fossil in the African Savannah?
Why did he make EVERYTHING so easy to put together? It's so amazing! To write this and know exactly how I got here. WHO CAN'T BE AMAZED BY THAT?!!!?!

If I do come out and if I am honest with myself, I will just be mentally discriminated by everyone. 
I keep thinking about suicide day in and day out, because to be honest, if hell were real; it would be a better place than this living hell I'm experiencing every single day. Like I can't even talk to anyone because all I got are just weird looks as if I'm the crazy one. Shouldn't it be easier to lose faith then it is to have it?? I feel it's easier to gain faith than it is to lose it. ""I exist therefore there is a God."" I feel like that's how it works. Everybody is already prewired with a predisposition in their mind of already having the idea that there is a deity, no questions asked. If losing faith is so easy.... THEN WHY HAVEN'T I MET ANYBODY WHO DENIES RELIGION?? 

I'm sorry if I offend anybody but that's just what I'm going through and I feel like nobody gives a crap about me because they think I'm probably possessed or something. It makes me so uncomfortable having 3 churches on every block in my town like 1 wasn't enough. I feel like I'm living in the Truman show. 

PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD HELP AND GIVE ME SOME ADVICE!! (No pun intended)"

"Sort of ventingHi, well this is going to be a wall of text so I don't blame you for not reading it, I just want to get this off of my chest, I never have before

I've never been diagnosed with depression, I've never talked to anyone about it, maybe I'm just a narcissist who is sad all the time I don't know. But I do feel ""sad"" a lot, around 6 years I've felt a numbness in the back of my mind which comes and goes as it pleases. I remember being around 12-13 years old and crying/praying to God to take me in my sleep, I didnt want to live anymore, and waking up the next day, and the day after, and the day after that was part of the reason I stopped believing in religion. I was lonely, I was bullied in school by my ""friends"", but I stuck by them because they were all I had. Eventually things did get better, I made new friends, my confidence grew and the want to die did go away.
Up until about 2 years ago I was ""ok"". My best friend (no longer, she was a horrible person) stopped wanting to hang out with me and spend time with her boyfriend instead. The kicker is that her boyfriend was also one of my best friends and I was infatuated with him, so you can see how fun that time was (for the record I never cheated with him, but she assumed that we had something going, even though I was his friend long before I knew her). I live quite far away from the rest of my friends, and so hardly seen the rest of them, I still barely do, perhaps once a month at best?
Currently I'm 18 and I'm just tired of living, to be honestly it's not living I'm doing anymore, it's ""surviving"" and honestly I'm horrible at it. I dropped out of Uni a few weeks ago because I hated what I did, and now have no idea what I want to do with my life. I have a part time job in retail and that's not what I want to do for the rest of my life, but it's looking more likely as I'm such an undecided person, that's if I even get back into university, I have to take a year out. Life to me now is a haze of staying up until 3-4am playing video games, sleeping until 12, rinse and repeat. Games make me feel like I have a sense of purpose, they fill time and allow me some escapism, I'm a terrible daydreamer, but I prefer living in a fake reality.
Honestly the only thing that's stopping me from hanging from a tree is my family. I just wish that my parents hated me, I want them to hate me so badly that the thought of losing me won't bother them, but honestly it will kill them. My dad has bad mental health, he suffers from bad anxiety and PTSD (resulting from traumatic past, we live in a shitty country which had a bloody 30 year period). I just can't hurt them, but the thought of having to continue like this is too overwhelming. They're so dissapointed in me from quitting Uni, they sort of support me of course, but compared to the rest of my star cousins I'm just the dropout, the disappointment of the family. I feel so out of place with my family, they're so different from me, outgoing and happy, and what they say can hurt ""You need to go out more, meet a boy etc"" and those sorts of things, it hurts because I know it's true and because mostly they just pity me and I don't want them to. My mother forces my cousins to invite me places, it's just fucking embarrassing. I do have friends, albeit only around 2-3, but I never make any effort, and I don't blame them for not making any effort with me.
I've never told anyone about what goes on inside my head, my mum has some idea, bringing me to the doctors who lovingly just diagnosed me with a bad case of PMS. My friends have no idea, the only one I have ever told is my former best friends Boyfriend, he suffers from depression and is on anti-depressants etc but we have stopped speaking as of recently, he has a great social life etc and I don't blame him for wanting to cut me out
I'm going on holiday in July with my friends, which is one thing to look forward to. But hopefully by the end of the summer I won't be here anymore. Last year I promised myself if I didnt get into Uni, I'd do it, but I did and I was so so so happy, I thought my life would change, I achieved something. But no, I'm still stuck in this rut I have been for 6 years, I have nothing to live for, I'm just a waste, when I die my organs will be donated so that some poor person who really deserves this life can carry on, at least I can give some happiness and joy to the world that way.

Thank you for reading this if you did."
"I'm going to be gone by tonightI'm done.  I can't live like this.  I've endured pain without end and I cant' take it anymore.  I play video games? EVIL, NO FOOD FOR THREE DAYS.  I hit back onto the countless people who abuse me? STUPID FUCKING IDIOT, JUST TAKE IT, NO LEAVING YOUR ROOM FOR A FUCKING WEEK.  And now I am finally going to be free.  For the first time in so many years I can be useful and become a news story."
"Can't bear the thought of one more day...Life keeps becoming more and more unbearable. I keep feeling like there's a stone stuck in my throat and like my heart is about to burst out of my chest. There's nothing that I derive joy from these days. Even if I knew I could have it all; love, money, health, beauty, amazing friends, even if I knew I could end everyone's suffering and make the world a much better place, I would still prefer to end my life. It's such a cruel world and I can't stand being a part of it. Even when nothing is wrong, it feels like everything is wrong. The only thing I crave is the taste of nothingness. There's nothing that I look forward to more than being put to rest. I literally have no energy anymore. I can't force myself to eat, and when I do, food has no taste and I feel like throwing up. Everything feels like a chore. Waking up, getting dressed, showering, brushing my hair, talking, even thinking. I feel so heavy, so lonely, so worthless, and I just find myself crying like a baby for no reason. Every time I look at my own reflection in the mirror, I see no sign of life. I only see the void staring back at me; a skeleton; something that can't be classified as human.

My relationship with my family is so superficial. My mother is miserable and I make her even more miserable. I have no real friends. It gets so lonely to the point that it starts to physically hurt.

I've always been an A+ student. I spent three years working my ass off so I can afford going to grad school, and now that I've put all of my life savings into this master's degree and know I will have no money left after this, I can't even force myself to work, even when I know my future depends on this degree. I have three essays of 12,000 words to write in less than six days, and I haven't even started. They make up 100% of my final grades. I had more than a month to work on them, but all I ever did during that time was sleep or lie in bed and do nothing. I can't even muster the courage to talk to my professors and explain the situation to them. They all know me as someone who participates in class, comes prepared and dares to be argumentative. I'm mortified that I'm so weak and pathetic. It's humiliating. I'm so disgusted with myself.

I've been having the worst panic attacks every single day for over two weeks now, and they usually hit me when I go to bed. I start shaking uncontrollably and feel like I'm about to have a heart attack. Even when I stop shaking, the pain in my chest is so unbearable and keeps me awake for at least three hours, and there's nothing that I can do to stop it. I'm just so sick and tired of this. I don't have the energy to fight for anything anymore.

I suffer from trichotillomania and I've pulled my hair to oblivion these past two weeks. I spend hours at a time doing nothing but pulling my hair from the roots. More than two thirds of my hair are gone. I look like a monster. I feel like I have somehow managed to reduce myself to a pile of shit. I feel like a good-for-nothing coward; a weakling; a failure; a disappointment to everyone and myself. 

The only thing stopping me from killing myself is that I don't want to traumatize the people that I care about. I have a loving and understanding boyfriend, but I'm too afraid of taking him to a place that is so dark. I don't understand what he sees in me and keep wondering if he really loves me. I look at him and I see life, joy, beauty, movement, and I always feel like I'm a toxic presence in his life and he'd be better off without me.

I'd rather feel anything but this..."

Why am I still hereI've dealt with addiction for about four years now I've been battling depression for almost 6 years but I've been afraid to get help. Idk why I am still on this earth and it seems that every few months I get serious depression and suicidal thoughts. I don't know what to do and even things that generally made me happy in the past don't make me feel any different anymore. I've tried to set myself on a straight path but every time I let myself down and relapse. I don't want to hurt anyone else so I just keep to myself and don't even go out anymore but I'm not sure how much longer I can go on like this.
"making this post before its too latethis shitty story starts with me admitting myself to the psych ward after breaking down due to many many years of pain. if im gonna kill myself then might as well give this world one last chance. there in this unit i meet a girl, i will call her Sarah in this post. all of my life ive been very alone, even by the time ive found friends everything still felt very superficial. i was way too broken to ever have something that felt real. and i never thought i would find someone as broken as me. 


but sarah had pretty much the same struggles as me, all the same problems (not going into specific diagnoses since i dont think it matters). with the difference that she was way more worse of than me. 

for the first time in my life ive felt like someone understands me, like im not alone, like im valued.

ive moved units pretty soon but weve kept closely in touch. atleast unless one of us was having a breakdown.

its part of my symptoms that i tend to obsess over people, but this was something new. ive finally learned what it felt like to have someone matter to you. 

for the first time ive cared about what happens to another person. 
during my stays in different units (in still in one btw) there was a time where i was highly suicidal. 
i told her, she freaked, said she wouldnt be able to stand losing me. so i stayed alive. again, for the first time i had something important enough for me to kepp living and endure the pain that comes with it.


now a few months later. my life is still hell. tho i atleast feel like i made a little bit of progress. 
but sarah has been getting worse. she had a couple of attempts, got into drugs and has been locked up in safety units most of the time. 
i tried my best to help her but its impossible to help someone who just wants to die. i still would do ANYTHING to make her happier, but im pretty much powerless.


fastforward to a couple days ago. shes in a horrible state. is on drugs and plans to commit suicide by the end of the day. 

i somehow manage to convince her to come over, to wait one more day. she does but not a long time passes until she has a complete breakdown. she would have gone and jumped. so i called an ambulance they took her away. 

they took her back to the psychward where she stayed 2 days until they forcibly discharged her since ""she was too much too handle"". great healthcare i know -.-

right now she probably is still discharged. i dont know if she is still alive. maybe she is just drugged up at someones place.


ever since i called the ambulance my days have been especially hard. i think of myself as a traitor most of the time. 
it would already be unreasonable to force someone with my level of pain to continue going. but the shit she has to deal with....
its just inhumane if i would still try to keep her alive.


but i dont know how to cope with it. even tho i made progress im still highly unstable. but no matter my problems, i wouldnt be able to kill myself while she is still alive. i wouldnt be able to do this to her.

but now.... if she dies i wont be able to handle it.

i already just want to end it all, but the death of someone i care about would push me over the edge.
but this post is still not about me.


im making this post while she is maybe alive. so i dont have to write in past tense.

im making this post so that i have done everything i can to help her.


this is probably a very enbarrassing post to read. but im fine with that.

as long as there is a non-zero change of sarah getting better, i will keep going."
"Lonely, Feel Useless, What's the Point?Not sure where to start here. I found today that I've been weighing the options in my head: kill myself or try to get help. Both seem feasible to me. But part of me thinks if I get help, it isn't going make me fit in anywhere or suddenly make people like more for more than a few months. I can't see how it can change my life that significantly.

I'm living in a city that I adore. I moved to this country five years ago and have been in the city for nearly a year of it. However, it feels this city is the only thing I have. I have no family here, people never stay friends with me for more than a year at best. I don't know if they just can't take my odd moods (when I let my guard down about depression and anxiety) or what it is.

I'm a girl and I'm gay but I've not had a proper relationship. I dated a girl for about 2 months two years ago but she broke it off, which was really probably for the best as it never would have worked. I've fallen for a couple of girls since then, but after initially liking me, they decide they don't. 

My one closest (I use the term loosely) friend that I have now is one such girl. This time last year I was staying at her place instead of travelling for work and was incredibly happy. We had been on several what I had considered dates and things were going great. Now I'm not quite sure if she even wants to be friends with me. I could tell she was becoming more distant earlier this year. In March I told her how I felt about her and I got the 'you're an amazing person; but'. I'm sick of people who don't give a shit about me telling me I'm amazing and then disappearing out of my life.

I don't hear from my family much, what family I do have. I used to speak to my dad on Skype on the time. However his life has changed with a new partner a few years ago and months can go by without us speaking.

The only place I feel needed is at work. It's also where I do most of my socialising which I know isn't a good thing. I like the people I work with most of the time, even if I don't always enjoy work itself. Outside of work, I feel my existence is pointless. I'm not an important or necessary part of anybody else's life.

When I think about dying, I think the only people who would eventually notice would be work. I think about that every once in a while and it just makes me so sad.

I'm overweight. Not incredibly, but enough that I'm not comfortable and that my doctor has told me I should lose weight. I've tried dieting but it made me hungry. I tried going to the gym but I got bored with it. I'm thinking of trying Couch to 5K, but dunno if I can be arsed. Junk food is my vice. I don't drink or smoke or do drugs. Instead I'll have junk food. 

It seems just so much simpler to just end it. Though I'm not sure how to go about it. I stand on a rail platform and I want to either jump on the rails to be electrocuted or in front of the train as it pulls in. I think of jumping out infront of traffic. I think of drowning in the river. I haven't tried do actually do anything since I was a teenager when I tried to choke myself several times in the span of a couple of years. I would feel terrified afterwards.

Thought about maybe trying CBT as I've read it can help with depression and anxiety. I can get really anxious and nervous in social situations to the point where I have to leave so I can cry / hyperventilate outside. I was at an event tonight that I thought I'd enjoy but I didn't. I was very aware I was the only person there on my own and that made me very uncomfortable. In some situations I'm fine with being on my own. Otherwise I'd never go anywhere or do anything. But that's usually at things where everyone else is mostly on their own as well, and we're not really expected to socialise (gigs, walks, lectures, stuff like that).

Been on anti-depressants for a couple of years now. I had my dosage halved a few months ago as I thought I was feeling better, but I'm thinking I'll need to revers that if I continue on.

I just want to find some peace, and not hurt anymore.

Apologies if this isn't very cohesive. Just a lot of thoughts in my head I had to share somehow to someone."

"Everything is just too much workWorking to pay bills and expenses. Having to continuously shop for things I need. Having to not only eat food, but make nutritious choices so my body doesnât feel any worse than it already does or so I donât become ugly, even though Iâm getting uglier every day that passes. Having to do things like maintain my hygiene. Feeling lonely but then feeling like I have to put on an act to meet and keep new people in my life. Trying to make myself heard and recognized and respected in my professional life. Stressing myself out to no end to get a degree for a job that I know Iâm going to get tired of eventually and will want to quit (because I never finish anything anymore and I hate myself for it) but also fearing not âmoving forwardâ in life because  Iâm fucking 23 and already feel âbehindâ my peers who have just graduated or started their families, and meanwhile I recently learned I canât have children and changed into a major that set me back 3-4 more YEARS and thousands of dollars in tuition. And for what? So I can continue to struggle through life? So people can continue to use me and ignore me and the world can continue to crumble around me? I donât want to fucking do it anymore. I didnât get a choice about doing it or not. And I wish more than anything that my husband or mom or grandma wouldnât be destroyed if I checked out, or that my dogs wouldnât wonder what happened to me or why the household is sad.

"It's starting to get bad againI don't wanna live anymore, and all I think about it suicide. From the minute I wake up to the minute I fall asleep, all I think about are ways I could kill myself: casually stepping in front of a bus, overdosing on my prescription sleeping pills, drinking myself to death, cutting my veins vertically so deep that they can't stitch them back up-- it doesn't matter. I was 9 months clean from cutting but just relapsed two weeks ago and now it feels like I'm addicted again: my forearms, thighs, ankles, wrists, and legs are littered with scars, just like before, but honestly cutting is the only thing that brings me relieve nowadays. I'm tired of my meds not working, I'm tired of crying myself to sleep every night, I'm tired of nobody noticing/caring enough to say anything, I'm tired of putting on a fake smile in public, I'm tired of my anxiety, depression and bipolar disorder ruining my life... but really, I'm just tired of living.

"I think I finally have the ability to do it.Thereâs a point on my commute where you merge onto a different highway and thereâs 3 empty lanes overlooking a big field far below. Sometimes I like to play chicken with myself and close my eyes and see how far I can drift across the lanes until I get too scared. 

Iâve always had one-off thoughts of suicide since my childhood, but this year has really pushed me further and further to the point where I have daily fantasies about killing myself. I donât think anyone has ever fully understood who I am and what I go through, and people I have tried to open up to are always unwilling to accept that Iâm mentally ill or pushed away by me. 

Iâve had constant chills through the past months. My anxiety and depression are wrecking my health and my ability to be a productive person. I canât focus on tasks or achieve anything of worth. Itâs hard to go outside. Iâm at the age of applying for college and Iâve barely done anything because I donât believe that Iâve ever had anything worth developing. Iâm a failure. Everyone around me is unaware of my thoughts, and Iâm worthless compared to all of them. My only worth has been accrued through what Iâve done for others; looking back, itâs like Iâve never been my own person at all. 

I donât think anyone really knows me as a person. Thereâs nothing to care about anyways. Iâm not really sure what the point of this post is; I guess itâs the cry for help that Iâm too scared to do in real life. I donât know if itâll be today or tomorrow or next week, but I think sooner than later Iâm going to close my eyes and let my car careen off the highway and carry me to the only fate I think I deserve."

This country could only be described as ''bad'' so I can't get any help from any service, or at least having much expectations from them.

I want to take my life!!!!!! I can't keep this up. Not feeling like a human or having human rights make me want to end all this and I actually find it beautiful.

"I refuse to keep living anymoreSeriously I'm done. Nothing can make me change my mind. Family and friends? Fuck em. In a sense I want to die just to hurt them, the only thing I'll miss is their reactions to it. It'll be hilarious if I could see them crying their hearts out because they miss me so much.

I never cared about anyone but myself so this makes it all the more perfect. I don't plan on living past 25. All I need is a way to die. Maybe I'll get lucky and get run over by a train or speeding car or get cancer or something. Maybe I might even get murdered.

The possibilities are endless but they bring about an end! Ironic huh? Wow I am losing my sanity."

How could we spend years taking care of each other and he doesnât love me back. I know Iâm probably co-dependent at this point. It feels like Iâm never going to be able to love someone else like this. It makes me wonder what other people have thatâs so special that Iâm missing. That I have to be alone. I donât want to feel anything anymore. I scrutinize everything I do like maybe thatâs the reason Iâm so fucking awful Iâm not worth anything to anyone. Iâm anxious 24/7 Iâm exhausted, Iâm depressed. I feel disgusting and I just want the hurt to stop. My last serious lover up and disappeared on me, and now this.

"Psychiatrist can't see me until November and I think I need help, what do I do?Recently things have been really bad and I have got in touch with a private psychiatrist and they said they can see me in November. I really can't wait that long as things are bad and I need help.

There are no psychiatric hospitals or wards in my country so that's not an option. Furthermore the general hospital only has limited spaces for mental health patients so that's not an option either. In the past I have presented myself to the emergency department as being suicidal three times and each time they have got my parents to pick me up (I'm an adult) and take me home and made an appointment to ring me a few days later. My doctor says he can't help me, which is why I was going to see a private psychiatrist. There is a crisis team, however because I am not in the mental health system anymore, that's not an option (getting referred into the public system again would take four to six weeks, by which time it's November). Helplines are of no interest to me as I don't want to vent things, I want to talk about medications (I have already been on a wide range of anti-depressants) and to help have some more insight into how I am.

I have no idea on what to do as I need help. I am not in imminent danger however I often feel close to it. I have no support people, support networks or friends that can help me out until then. Simply waiting it out is not an option as I am worried about myself. Plus with how bad I have been feeling, six to seven weeks is a \*really\* long time."
"I dont expect anyone to read this, I just want it somewhere else than on my hd8:25pm EST 2/2/13

I had the chance to die tonight. 

The day began tentatively, it was a Saturday, I had boxing at 2pm. Boxing on the weekends meant boxing with Adam whoâs a southpaw and a lot better than me with no ability to control power. I thought I was gonna get my nose broken, wouldâve been better if I had. 
It was humiliating; there was even a new guy who doesnât train there at all but was a natural, who kicked my ass with ease as Adam does. I couldnât even hold up through the exercises and drills. Adam rocked me back into the mirrors on the wall doing the up count to 10 via jab and jab cross drill. Adam had no problem taking my hits, my jab was weak as hell and my cross was nowhere near as strong. I was leaning too much on my left foot. 
And sparring. Sparring was the worst part. They all danced around me, flurried and battered me. Darryl even switched it up so I was just offense and they were defense and I was still pitiful; I couldnât land anything, they landed everything. Big Chris said before sparing that in a year itâd be me in a toughman, and those words stung after my floundering. I didnât move, I didnât throw, I didnât do anything. It was like I couldnât move my body. I wanted to blame it on the cold but we had turned on the heater in the gym and it wasnât cold anymore. I was just pathetic. 

This isnât supposed to happen. Not like this anyway. I did thisâ¦I did this to better myself; I took up boxing because it was supposed to remove all the sad and lethargic, cut the fat and the meek out of my life. But it hasnât. I know things might take time, I know that Iâve only been there four months or whatever, but thatâs no excuse for my failure. 
And if this is a failureâ¦if this, the radical edge in reach of my resources is not enough to fix me then I do not know what can. /This is the ultimatum curfew that passes the regional experience that bethrones all the bastardization that had come before me/. My chin trembled on the ride home as I tried to control myself. I didnât cry, but I couldnât compose myself properly either. I could see myself in the reflection of anything. I could see my shortcomings, my weakness, my stupidity, my worthlessness, all of the waste that I really am at the end of the day. After I took a shower I was still having bouts of blubbering. 
And what it was, at the end of the day, in the 20/20 hindsight, the idea that I could crash and die on the way there that made me go. It was that and nothing else. I had no desire to go and be humiliated by athletes an innumerable times my skill. I had no desire to go Sunday, or Monday, or any other day. I thought about Blake and other members reassuring me on the weekdays of my progress. I thought about how wholly they must be lying with straight eyes. I imagined that whenever they did spar with me theyâd go a whopping ten percent of their power while I would go fifty or more, it made no difference. 

There was an mma fight tonight, in Marion, NC at 6pm. I actually wanted to go at the time it was announced, I even paid my thirty dollars for a ticket. The roads were icy. And I wasâ¦unaligned. I went because I wanted to die then. I wanted to skid out on black ice and crash and die. It would look like an accident, itâd be perfect. 

And I did. 

I spun out.

I spun out near Waynesville, I was merging over to the left lane and I guess I went too fast, overcorrected, and reversed the car. It skidded along the guardrail as I nonchalantly cursed my luck, âI get what I ask for, huh?â
I got back on the road after two guys helped me out, an ambulance that either one of them or luck called held back traffic while I got on the road and turned around. I kept going until I reached the Waynesville exit and turned into a Loweâs parking lot. 

And I was there. 

I was at that point when I couldâve kept going, knowing full well the consequences. I started tearing up again, like a bitch. 
I thought about calling Taylor, telling him it wasnât an accident and making him promise not to tell my parents as I waited for the cold to take me while my flipped car was wrapped around a tree. A good Samaritan wouldâve pulled over and try to open my door in concern. Iâd look at him with tears in my eyes then whisper between cracked lips, let me die. The ambulance would come but itâd be too late, Iâd die on arrival to the hospital, the last sounds Iâd ever hear would be a siren wailing. 

Would it really be so bad? 


Alisha had her baby yesterdayâ¦
â¦a life for a life? How sad could they get at an accident when their darling granddaughter was sleeping in the next room? 





But thatâs not what happened.

I sent a text to Dee explaining my bitching out of coming to the fight; I secretly hoped she would reaffirm my cowardice as I had with my call with Taylor. 
And I waited. 

I just waited in that parking lot for a good five minutes or so. Not dramatically long. 

I had the chance to die. 

I couldâve kept going to Marion, I knew I would crash or so if I did. I knew what would happen. And if not going there then coming back the same night. Just to drive that stake in the ground, to be sure that Iâd die, to force Death to play its hand. 

But thatâs not what happened. 

I turned around and drove 25mph all the way back to school, fishtailing two or three times. 

I felt like a lair and a coward. I had boasted for Death to take me, I wanted to die. I had my chance and when I backed out on it, I was a fraud who didnât try hard enough.

"I feel depressed because I'm scared my life will be boring I'm only 14, and I've heard people say to me that I should be having the time of my life at this age but I'm not. I'm suddenly extremely afraid and almost depressed thinking I don't make a difference, and that whatever I do, I'm still going to die and my whole life will just be gone. I have so much stress on me aswell and I feel like it isn't even worth it to live this long just to die anyways. I almost can't seem to think straight, like I try to see what's good in life, some things come up but it's like there's fog in front of them so they don't really mean much. I don't know if I want to die, I don't know if I am happy or sad.

They then use the excuse I am too pale and not getting enough sunlight but Iâm not gonna get anymore sunlight if you open the curtains because Iâm just gonna close them again and get in bed. Then they have a go at me because I spend too much time locked in my room and itâs unhealthy and a load of that crap.

"I don't know if I'll make it to 30. I've wanted to die since I was 13.I'm 28 now. When I was 13 I tried to hang myself, but my dad stopped me. They got me a therapist and it made me feel better for a short time. I realized I'm still a loser after talking to them. Their words change nothing.

It doesn't help knowing my life was stolen from me because of my looks. I grew up around two very attractive people. My bro didn't need to say anything and girls would walk right up to him. My mother would get stopped often and complemented on how beautiful she is. Me? I've had people say they thought I had down syndrome.

I was never picked for teams or groups. When I finally had 'friends' I was the butt of everyone's joke. Being ugly spills over into all aspects of life. What point is there  to be a wage slave and come home to nothing? What point is their to finish college? What do I have to look forward to? I'm almost finished and my grades have tanked. My 3.6 is now a 2.1 and I don't even give a shit. I've tried that better yourself bullshit and think positive. It only made my situation worse.

People mocked me for even trying. I cold approached women after hitting the gym for a year and was mocked and rejected. I had friends who never hit the gym, fat, negative as fuck and they get a mate. It's bullshit!! I do own a love doll. We've been together for 2 years, but it's just putting a small bandage over a decapitated leg. I just wanted to vent. No one can help me. I'm trapped in this genetic prision."
Hi guys my friend is working really hard on his stream right now and has been for the past 2 weeks It would mean a ton if u could help him out[here](https://www.twitch.tv/3goofball3) is a link
Do you think my friend could forgive me and give me another chance I messed everything up for the hundredth time. I'm not someone people want to be friends with but I finally made a friend who actually wanted to talk to me and he was the only one who talked to me throughout the day but I ruined everything. I have hurt him in so many ways and now he hates me

"It's All Beginning To Be Too Much...Depression is fucking *harsh*. I'm convinced it's the most vile and disgusting thing in this world.

It's making me fail my classes because I can't concentrate on my homework and I just *can't* do anything. I get distracted by things too easily, and just can't focus. I get carried away by my own thoughts. *And not to mention* that I can't remember shit. It's only getting worse, too, as I fall deeper into depression; a few months ago, I just forgot what homework I had or what I left in my room, *now?* Now, I can't even remember what day it is. I can't remember what day or time it is and what responsibilities I should be doing. I can't remember anything, not even to shower or eat.

Depression has made me tired and I'm starving but at the same time I'm just not hungry at all. I can't sleep because I'll sit there for *hours* but my head won't shut up, and when I finally do fall asleep, I keep waking up at random times in the middle of the night. And if I don't do that, then my dream conscience is a *bitch*. When dreaming, minding my own business, a thundering voice says, ""don't take your medication, it's disgusting poison"", ""don't try to get in shape, you'll fail anyways"", ""don't trust her, she's a liar"". I *hate* depression.

I hate this. I'm scared of death, and yet there's that stupid little voice in my head saying ""just kill yourself"". I hate depression. I hate this. I don't want to kill myself but I can't stop thinking about it because my conscience thinks it's a damn good idea.

This is *exhausting*. I might knock myself out cold to avoid this pestering voice telling me to just off myself.

EDIT: How do you guys even *cope* with this? How do you ignore that stupid voice and just get on with your life? Don't tell me medication is the only option because I *really* don't trust medication and brain-altering drugs like that. They're just easy methods of controlling people, because people take them so willingly."
"Need help.I don't know what to do. Ending it seems like the only way out. 
Have no idea why I'm even on here, maybe it's a good place to say goodbye!

Edit: I don't know where to start, but here goes. I'm a 21 year old female. Live with my father's parents who are strict Sikhs. I myself have no interest in religion, yet they force it upon me. I'm under a strict regime, I can't socialize with friends at college and have to notify them at all times as to where I am. Due to these rules, I have no close friends, as I have been living back and forth between Canada and England. My parents and siblings still live in Canada and I haven;t seen them since September. I had a history of depression but had gotten over it until recently when I felt myself slipping back into it. I know that what I'm feeling is irrational but I feel as though it would help me. 
There is more to this but it's too hard to share as I know it would just worsen my attitude towards my decision. "
"I feel like a failure...(I'm 20, in college, still supported by my parents)

I have everything. I have beauty, smarts, friends, family, love, people who WANT me, material items like clothes and a car, and most importantly I have my health. Why would anyone like me feel the need to end her life? Sure, I have a bubbly personality. No one would expect that Iâm being troubled by god knows what. I wear a smile on me like itâs permanently glued on my face until Iâm all alone and Iâm allowed to untie the sutures that keep it upright. I have a fucking skip in my step. I am the definition of perky. I radiate so much whatever it is that someone like me radiates that itâs sickening to some people. How on earth can someone like me even consider doing something so drastic to oneself? 

Itâs little things. No one respects me. I lack dignity. I barely overcame my issues with my self confidence and esteem. I am finding it difficult to be mature. I have no motivation. No goals. No career aspects. Iâm just a mindless drone who is stuck and no one seems to care. I'm driving people away with my downward spiral when I'm in one of my moods... I'm just not happy with myself."
"This is gonna get a lot of hate but needs to be said If you have a crush on someone donât take it too far, A lot of people have crushes and Itâs normal.However, donât take it too far. Itâs fun to have a pretend life with a crush but donât create this fantasy man/woman and feel shattered when it doesnât pan out. It was never even a real person. Just focus on yourself, and donât chase someone, if you are chasing someone makes sure itâs like 50/50. If your always thinking about your crush and they definitely arenât giving you that type of energy then back off, donât get your heart broken by someone you didnât date. You can have someone in mind but donât fall head over heels in love, thinking about them 24/7 thinking about them, dreaming about them when they definitely dont think of you like that, your wasting time, if you chase your dreams girls will come."

"Pathetic attempt @ suicide.I tried to stab myself I guess with a kitchen knife (which was a stupid plan because that thing couldn't even pierce a pillow). My bf called the police and they took me to a psychiatric hospital but the lady there said she ""wasn't convinced I wanted to die"" and said I could go home if my bf promised to stay with me that night. When he left in the morning I tried to slit my wrists. My legs were like slick with blood and I felt faint but I was still just. Alive. Now my bf is crying all the time, talking about how awful it was for him that I wanted to die (shouldn't I be the one crying???) and calling me 32 times if I don't answer his messages within like 10 minutes and I'm getting REALLY TIRED of babying him when I am the one who feels like I cannot live.  Every time I hear sirens outside my window I panic that he called the police again. I cannot listen to music without feeling pain. I cannot do anything without thinking about how I'll never have even one second of happiness ever again after this attempt. I wish I had died. Should have tried harder. "
"I'm so tired of being tiredthis is just gonna be me rambling about some of the shit ive been through because at this point i dont really have another place i feel comfortable putting this kind of stuff, im sorry if that isnt sub appropriate, i feel like im on a wire in a circus every time i get out of bed lmao

i got  denied for disability because i need more of a ""paper trail"" but i have absolutely no income so i cant really afford 3-4 monthes of psychiatrists saying the same shit theyve been saying since i was a teen, but apparently stuff from when youre younger just isnt good enough i guess? even though ive got a psychosis diagnosis going back to 11 years old and a schizophrenia diagnosis from like 17 onwards

my mom is trying my patience for lack of a better term. shes been either abusing me or ignoring me basically as long as i can remember, and its been downhill ever since my grandma died. she was my rock and i truly think i died with her and that im not real but i wont go too far into that kind of shit because im embarrassed of my mental illness and delusions. im ashamed of being this way. i wish i was just normal and could work a job i hate but i cant even leave my house . i relapsed self harm and its all i can think about anymore, just a way to have a SHRED of control over my life at almost 22 fuckin years old. i feel so pathetic. it really feels like this world really just doesnt care about low income people, let alone low income mentally ill people and im so tired of trying to fight for below the bare minimum

ive never had a want for a future before, but i want one now, and i feel like i destroyed my chances when i was a teenager. its heartbreaking to look back and think of all i could have done different and look now and not be able to find options other than waiting. its hard to wait when thats all youve been doing and you feel like youre in a shrinking cage with no way out every time you take a breath"

"I'm going for a walk.I never thought I'd actually attempt suicide. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but never acted upon them. It was like I was a different person.
I was ready to die that night, when I thought I lost everything for the second time. The first time I lost everything, living was so awful, it's hard to put in words. It was all my fault. I wanted to be punished, and death was the only suitable punishment. 
I cried until I couldn't cry, and then I would cry more. I didn't have anyone, but I didn't deserve that. In so much pain, I was already as good as dead. 
Even in my darkest abyss, however, there is a light. I survived, and fought for a second chance. This time around, the light was gone. I had lost something important to me. My fault again. 
As soon as I realized, my soul had left. My thoughts left my mind, and I lost my voice.
It was about 9:30 PM, below freezing. I opened the door, with my brother asking where I was off to. 
""I'm going for a walk,"" I managed to say. 
Only wearing shorts, a t-shirt, a light jacket, and sneakers, I just started walking. Wasn't going anywhere, just walking. I was hoping to freeze to death, or get hit by a car. I fell a few times because of the ice and snow, but I kept walking. 
I was outside for an hour. There was no turning back now. I didn't even know where I was. As I was ready to inflict more pain on myself, I got a phone call. From my mother. She noticed I was out for a while. Listening to her voice, sobbing, I snapped out of it. I didn't want to die, nobody does. I was just terrified of living in guilt. I was terrified of living like I did when I lost everything. But I didn't lose everything. 
After the call, I had to get back home. I didn't realize how dark, scary, and cold it was. Instead of walking, I ran. Following my own footsteps, I ran the whole way back home. Felt like Forest Gump. I was exhausted.
In the lights of my house, I notice my hands were a deep blue. Everything hurt. I looked in the mirror, I looked like someone else. 
When my mother called, my phone was at 1%. If it wasn't on, I would be dead today.


Sorry if this doesn't make a lot of sense, I left out a lot of details. I just wanted to put this somewhere. I'm sorry for anyone who has go to through things like this, and I hope they make it out alive."

"A week doesn't go by without me being so suicidal, that it makes my partner suicidal as well. And sometimes, my brain will convince me that the solution to it all is to just die.Today, like pretty much every single week for the past month, I would get into such a terrible mood that it would negatively affect my partner as well. It's so fucking stupid and annoying of me. I love him to death (inappropriate to say this now but oh well lol) but sometimes it feels like I'm a burden to him. So my brain is sitting here all ""KILL YOURSELF NOW OR ELSE I WILL!"" type bullshit, and I tell him quite frankly when I don't feel so good, which makes him sad and suicidal, which then makes me even more sad and suicidal, and then we both cry, act like we're about to do it, calm down, get over it. But that cycle really sucks. The guilt is also so ... intense.

But today, I was so sure that he was going to kill himself that my brain started immediately focusing on what I'd do to myself. That feeling of acceptance is scary and I do not want it ever again. I do not want to be okay with the idea of him killing himself, and then me doing the same. 

What sucks though is that our relationship is long distance, but we will meet soon. I wish I were with him. I think I would feel better if he were there in real life, and I would do just about anything to make him happy. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Traditional help (psychiatrist, medication, therapy) does not work. I've tried for years. What else could work? I don't believe in traditional medicine or homeopathy but I am desperate. "
"I don't want to go through life alone. I'd rather be dead.I've been miserable for such a long time. And every time I think things will get better, they never do and I end up feeling even worse. I can't even do the things I enjoy anymore, because those few moments when I actually have fun become ruined when I get home and remember that I'm still alone and my happiness was just an illusion. I can't keep going through all of this. And no one seems to care about how I feel at all. I keep being thwarted at every turn when I try kill myself, but none of those same people want to do anything to help my situation. I get no say in anything and no control over my own life. I didn't get to choose whether I was born and now I'm trapped in a miserable existence that I can't do anything about. It's completely ridiculous. I'm not okay with this. I'm not okay with anything and I never will be and I don't want to be. I just want the small things that will make me happy and I don't want them to be taken away. I would rather die on my own terms then to be old and die alone with no one close to me. I refuse to let that be my future."

"I feel so hurt I just want to die.The only think stopping me is Iâm too scared of the pain moments before it. But I hate myself. I feel like no one cares about me outside of my family, and though Iâm never bullied I never feel value. Girls only look at me because Iâm an attractive guy but then inside I feel lame as hell. Once they see that Iâm quickly left in the dust. My friends rarely if ever reach out to me first, I always feel like Iâm keeping these relationships going. I feel exhausted and Iâm only 19. 

I want to go back to when I was a kid. I feel like now Iâll get a burst of attention and feel loved and then Iâll be left in the dust. Whenever I struggle it seems no one cares and itâs me vs the world. I donât want these feelings. I think the worst thing right now is not having a textbook best friend, Iâve always wanted one but I donât. I try, but Iâm growing so tired no one understands. Everyone just says make more effort to give love but Iâm getting so so tiredð¥º... 

If there was a painless way to die Iâd do it right now except for the fact that my family would be devastated. Crap, thinking of that just makes me feel sadder and cornered, I feel like I canât escape. I canât afford a therapist and even if I could I donât want people to know my struggle... everyone sees me as the handsome, tall, kind friendly guy."
"Is suicidal thoughts common?Hey there,

I too, as many of you probably, have/had/will have thoughts about suicide.

I was wondering how common it is. Why do I have to have this thoughts if not everyone have them? 

What makes people who have not had this thought stay away from them even if they are in a shitty position?

Is it just thoughts that come to people who are failure like myself? 

But no, that cannot be true, since there are famous people who did suicide, along with the funniest man on Earth. Robin Williams.

To me, it seems as if suicide is a logical, yet extreme, option. If things are really out of hand, you have just take the ""safe"" root out. 

But why would I, come to this conclusion? if it was not logical. Even if you have depression as I am, sure logic seems logic. "
"My brother is dead and I feel so aloneMy brother died back in 2018 from an overdose, and I've never felt truly happy since. He was in rehab and promised to get better, but still ended up losing the battle. He and I used to text each other and have conversations and it would not make me feel stressed out about school and other things.

Now that he has passed, I never found out how to cope without him. I've been really sad, but managed to survive without him, but this year has been so awful and stesses me out, and no one else in my family will listen to me. And I feel like I'm going to lose the battle with depression."
"18 and just want to disappear as soon as possible.To make a long story short, I feel like shit and college doesnât make me feel any better. Aside from this, Iâve never loved myself. Middle school dropped my self-esteem to the ground and now I canât imagine anyone wanting to be with me. Iâm struggling with my sexuality and my parents are homophobic so I canât imagine coming out going well for me. I tried talking to my mom about how I was literally about to end everything and kill myself last semester but I just got yelled at and called ungrateful. She told me that people go through tougher shit than I have and that her and my dad are too busy to deal with my issues now. Iâm always there for my friends when theyâre down and I donât talk to them about my issues because I donât want to drag them down. I feel like Iâm at a dead end right now and just want this semester to end already so that I can have at least some of this weight off of my shoulders. I tried therapy for about 2 years a while back and it was working but my parents made me feel shitty for going because each meeting with my therapist cost $60, so they took me out of it because it was expensive. I want to end everything but I donât want my family to have to pay for funeral expenses and have them traumatized for life. I donât want to leave my friends behind because I know that my death would definitely take a toll on them. Last semester, I was in an even shittier place to the point where I actually walked around my campus looking for big buses or trucks driving around so that I could jump into them and get killed, but the guilt of scaring the driver and those around me at that moment was too much for me to handle. I do feel better now but I can feel myself sinking again. I just donât know what to do right now and Iâm lost. There might be grammar errors in this but I donât care. I just want to talk to someone, please. I donât know what to do and I feel like a lost cause; it really seems like I will only last 18 years if I keep this roller coaster of emotions up."
"Learning about basketball My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 months now, we're doing great and we love to share our special interests and things we're passionate about, and he really really likes basketball, he likes to play, he likes to watch games on TV and he loves to talk about it. Thing is: I don't even know the rules or anything about it except a few players' names and famous teams, and I'll like to learn more about it. I just don't know where to start and how I should approach it, I'd love to talk about it with him and understand when he's telling me about amazing moves and other things I just don't get right now.

"Whats the PointIt has been one year since I graduated University in Civil Engineering and cannot find a job and my life is going nowhere.

My parents look at me as a failure and I have no one in my life. I am currently 23 and have felt suicidal for three years and didnât kill myself since I hoped my life would get better after graduation, but instead it has only gotten worse. It feels pointless to continue to apply to jobs since everyone I graduated with found a job in less than 3 months, while I have spent 16 hours a day applying to jobs for a year and canât get anything.

She comes over and has a peek at my computer screen, and sees my friend searching up computers (not what hes supposed to be doing and me doing my work. The teacher makes my friend sit next to her, but then a minute later she becomes suspicious about me. She comes over again and sees me still doing my work. She demands to see the amount of work i've done, which is not much cuz im not the fastest worker, and just assumes i was playing games and tells me to show her my taskbar. Unfortunately for me, i had minecraft in my background from when i was playing with friends the night before, and she tells me to close it, threatening to give me detention, so i close it and the teacher goes back to her desk and starts flaming my friend. About 15 minutes later, i had made a lot of progress and i had to click on this link,, but my webpage kinda freezes so i start clicking frantically on the link. Teacher gets triggered and comes over to me, claiming she 'saw me playing games' and demanded to see my taskbar again. However, there were no games on my taskbar, so she tells me to do tHe RIghT THInG and walks away, with that 'fuck you' look on her face. I missed the detention my a millimetre lol.

"First day of high school! Hooray, right? I'm in high school. I'm gonna get a better education. I'm gonna have so much fun. Pretty much all my old friends from middle school are in the same high school as me and most of them are in the same class as me. Hooray, right?

If only I wasn't such a fucking failure of a human being, huh. If only I knew how to keep a conversation going. If only I knew how to talk to new people. If only I could get enough sleep to actually listen in school. If only I didn't basically have panic attacks in the middle of the hallway because there are too many people around. If only I wasn't constantly anxious about having all the possible mental and physical illnesses in the book. If only I wasn't bi and trans. If only I had a relationship with my dad whom I live with. If only the one person who I feel like actually gives a shit about me in this world didn't live 700km away.

I fucking know that no-one cares and that everyone has their problems. I just want someone to listen to me. I'm just so done and so miserable. I have no friends. I have zero social skills. I'm constantly anxious. Why does life have to be like this?"
"Failed out of universityThe other day--and it's not the first time something like this happens--my parents said they met some neighbour whose daughter (same age) had finished her studies, why not me?

Indeed, I should have graduated last year.  Instead, I have failed and destroyed all my chances.  Because this would be a very hard blow, I can't tell my parents.

Also, I started getting crushing anxiety when I leave the house, what if I run into an acquaintance or old classmate?  I was a fine student and person then, now I'm a failure of a human.

So last month I bought a method, have been practising and preparing to do it this Friday.

But this will completely devastate my family! So I've been trying to tactfully convince my parents that my death might be a good thing, but was entirely unsuccessful.

To think that last summer they suggested changing university... well, you only get one chance in life and I ruined mine."

 Im 22 and I've been struggling with depression for about 8 or 9 years now. I've been Suicidal for about 4. There is a good possibility that its genetic and wont go away. I hear that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem all the time, but what if the problem is permanent? So I guess this is more of a suicide note than a cry for help. 
I'm not really sure why I am the way I am. I used to be a kid who was known for being sensitive and sweet but after getting relentlessly bullied I became a bit of an asshole. Eventually I didn't really feel anything. I still had emotions but they were almost based on what I thought I should feel like rather than how I did. The only emotions that penetrate are sadness and anger. 
My freshman year of college was when I first started feeling suicidal. I didn't get out much and I just played video games and went to school. I met a girl on minecraft (yes I know hopeless) and I fell for her. She had it a lot worse than me but we found comfort in each other. For a while I felt like it was OK to be broken. Sadly she didn't love me the same way and ended up with a fantastic guy who has also become pretty important to me. I struggled for a while after this and just as i was nearing my 21st birthday I started drinking all the time. I felt alone all the time and my friends who I had been there for all abandoned me. To be fair I wasn't much fun. I had one friend who stuck by me. He even stopped me from killing myself a few times. Once we were coming back from a party I drank too much and he more or less dragged me 2 miles back to a safe place as I kept trying to step into traffic. 
I got a bit better after that. My online friends and those around me were really helpful. I started working again, and filled my life with social projects and work, I ended up only getting 4-5 hours of sleep a night for about 10 months. I know realize I wasn't really better I just never stopped to self analyze.
This august my minecraft friends and I got a cabin and we hung out for a few days. I spent every moment by the girl I had cared so much about and that's when I broke. I think it was the first time I was truly happy. When I got home I spiraled hard. My online friends pressured me into getting help and I did. My medication didn't agree with me and I ended up losing my job because the side effects were ripping me apart. It finally started to balance but frequently messed with me and made it hard to function. I got a new job for a bit but I lost that job a few weeks ago.
Throughout the whole thing my family hasn't seemed to understand. My mom and dad don't seem to give a shit and only focus on how bad I keep fucking up. 
Recently they took away the vehicle I had been using. I feel caged and sufficated.  I keep telling myself that things do get better but now I see that it doesnt. What makes it worse is i am afraid of death. Ive been wanting to give up but ive just been afraid to until today. I don't have a reason I'm this way and there is no fix. 
I know my story is pretty lame but after so many years of feeling like a puzzle with missing pieces I'm just done. I appreciate anyone who read this. I know it was lengthy but it was nice to share - Jiggy"
"I'm Completely Alone...I'm a guy hitting my mid-twenties, and I feel so alone and POWERLESS.  I've never touched a woman, and I feel nobody is interested in me.  Everyone ignores me.  My family treats me like a child, and everywhere I go I feel small and EMASCULATED.  I try very hard but I don't ever get credit for anything I do.  I'm so damn pessimistic, but maybe with reason.  I don't think I'll kill myself in the next few months, but I always worry that somewhere down the line, it will happen.  I'm just growing resentful of people and so damn tired.  "
"feelin' so super grossI've been depressed for basically my entire life, but I've never felt this constantly terrible. So few things are fun, my anxiety spikes over almost nothing, and I just feel like I'm burdening my friends and partners with my unrelenting unhappiness.


For a hot second, my partner really helped me feel better. I would spend time with them and I would forget all about my gross feelings. But lately, whenever it's time for me to leave, I feel like the rug is being pulled out from under my feet and I get very sad and I wall myself off because I don't want to cry and make them feel bad for leaving. I don't want to be that partner that ends up being emotionally manipulative because they get/act sad whenever their partner does something they don't like. But also, I don't want to deny my own emotions or distance myself from them... I like being vulnerable, but sometimes it feels too painful or like it would be inappropriate.


Anyway, I guess that was kind of a tangent. The point of all this is that I'm almost constantly thinking about self-harm or that maybe it would be better if I was dead, because then I would stop hurting and I would stop inconveniencing people through my hurting. And I guess that's part of the reason I hate leaving my partner's apartment; I have a knife in my room and I feel like I'm constantly aware of it... like's it's there for me if I ever decide I finally wanna take the plunge and start cutting and that utterly terrifies me. I would get rid of it, but it was a gift from my other partner (I'm poly) who lives far away now, so it means far too much to me.

"'The last time I'll' reflections.Since I was little I have been suicidal. So many plans. Fewer attempts. The attempts, have perversed this sense of 'last time Ill see my wife...last time to kiss her...smell her..'..it almost makes you reappreciate just everything youre going to miss. Im back to that feeling. This is the last time. Will this be the last time? One way or another-would be awesome, but my heart of heart tells me the pain isnt enough to give me the balls. Guess I should go the other way then.  Always a failure. Last time. Positive, we are always dying, for we never are who we were again, and we are always being reborn, in the new moment. Ha.

I sent him a text of how much I love him, but it seems like he blocked me I told my guy friend (also his friend) to send it to him, he said he never replied to it.

Itâs been two months since we broke up.

"In a pointless downward spiral - no clue how to crawl out.I'll try to keep this as brief as possible - despite having wonderful friends, an even more wonderful girlfriend, and a complete inability to panic, I am stuck in a default state of horrendous depression and only escape it by distracting myself with things like video games, drinking, or sex. I was in college for a year, dropped out to take an amazing job halfway across the country, and then was justifiably let go after only three months due to being generally incompetent at my unbelievably simple retail-oriented. It took me nearly half a year to find another job, only to be let go once more after just one month for what I can only assume was general incompetence (""you're just not the right fit for our company"" was the most detail they gave, and I felt I was doing a great job until then). I was hired at a place that gives very sporadic work not long after, and am only making enough money to pay for food/bus fare while my increasingly fed-up father has been paying my rent and bills. I keep searching for work, albeit without much heart, because my problem is that things just feel utterly hopeless on a cold, impossible-to-ignore logical level. I feel stupid and incapable of pulling off even the most basic of adult functions, which leads to depression, which leads to me moping around and not doing anything, which leads to proving the point (and angry room mates screaming about the messes I don't clean up), and on and on and on and on. Suicide, in my convoluted logic, isn't so much a one-way ticket to a pain-free state of being as it is a logical step to remove myself as a burden to everyone around me. The only thing keeping me from going through with it is the very laziness and lack of motivation that brings about the feeling in the first place - I'd have to push myself pretty hard to buy something to do the deed with, or crawl up an abandoned building somewhere.

TL;DR no matter how much work I do to try and free myself, I am completely stuck in life, so i'm left with no motivation to keep on trying."
"I just can't do this anymore.I have past posts with specifics about my garbage life if anyone actually wanted to read it, but the tl;dr is no job, no local friends, no money, family that likes to give shitty generic advice ""just move your sleep schedule, just get some exercise.""


I can't do it anymore.  I can't find a job - everything I apply to in my field just doesn't get back to me; I really don't want to work retail.  I can't go out in this city because I have no money and my abusive ex still lives in the area and I don't want to run into him.  I can't just make friends when I have no money to go out.  I absolutely hate living at home with my family and a crappy retail job won't allow me to move out on my own.


Last time things got close to this bad, I used to get through the day by remembering that I was never more than 20 minutes away from not having any problems anymore, but I don't think I can handle this cesspool of a life anymore.

"JUST do this, donât thinkDonât think too much about this, JUST do it:

- Find a quite place, where youâll not get disturbed

- You can sit or lay down for this

- Close your eyes

- Imagine a small river that flows. 
On that river there are some leaves. 

- Now put every, and i mean every, thought you have on a leave and let it flow down the river.
Donât make the river go faster of slower. Just observe as the thought flows on the river.

- If you get distracted by a thought, itâs okay, just come back to the river again, and put that thought on a leave and let it flow.

Do this for at least 3-5 mins.

Born to commit suicideIâve always thought about why I was here and what I was meant to do but you know after while I got to thinking that maybe I was put here to kill myself and ever since that thought it has stuck with me that I was meant to do that so Iâm wondering if anyone else has thought this? 
"I donât know what to do anymore, and I am extremely desperate to talk to someoneI want to start off by saying this: I feel like a total piece of shit for making this post. 90% of the posts in this sub are from individuals who are dealing with situations I couldnât even imagine, and my troubles pale in comparison to theirs. Allow me to explain.

I come from a well-off midwestern family, Iâve gotten into a great university, and from an outside perspective, my life appears to be well on-track. I am fortunate enough to have everything Iâve ever needed provided for me.

That being said, I think Iâm nearing the end of my rope. I donât know what to do anymore, and I just want everything to end. I donât want to die, but I donât want to live like this either. Iâve thought about suicide almost daily, and at this point Iâm just wishing I would die in some freak accident so that I donât bear the responsibility for my own death. 

If youâll indulge me, Iâd like to explain how I got to this point. 

Since I was young, Iâve always been the child that my parents ânever had to worry aboutâ. Iâm the youngest of four siblings, and a common stereotype in my family has always been that I was the âsmartâ one. The child that is going to âbe just fineâ all on their own. 

This stereotype was actually somewhat true during high school, for about three years. I was good at high school and my parents never had to ground me or take away privileges because of grades like they did with my other siblings. 

When the time came to apply to college, I got into an extremely prestigious university purely by nepotism. 

You see, I have an uncle who held a very prominent position at said university, and he pulled some strings to get me in. I know I donât deserve it, but nevertheless I accepted the opportunity. 

Well when I got to the university, it was the first time I never had to answer to anybody. My parents always assumed I was the âsmartâ kid that was fine by themself, but things went south pretty fast.

I did okay (not well, just barely okay) during my first year, but it wasnât long before things started to spiral. I began to struggle in class, and the stress of failing made it impossible for me to sleep. I would stay up all night (I swear to God this isnât an exaggeration. I couldnât sleep a wink) worrying about the work I needed to do for my classes. This became unbearable after a few months. I eventually turned to marijuana and alcohol just so I could get any form of sleep, and I turned to abusing adderall in order to get my work done. If my parents ever found out how often I abuse drugs, they would disown me. 

My plan of forcing my body to act how I wanted by using chemicals backfired in a really bad way. I NEEDED marijuana or alcohol In order to go to sleep, and I needed adderall in order to get ANY sort of work done. This system actually worked decently well, until I ran out of money. 

Today, I spend every. single. spare. cent. I can find on drugs. Iâm either buying marijuana and/or alcohol to sleep, or adderall to get my work done. Iâve gone several days without eating food in order to save up money for these drugs.

But it wasnât enough. I became very short on money, and I havenât been able to regularly afford any of these âperformance-enhancingâ drugs as much as I used to. Iâm on the verge of failing my third class of my college career, and I couldnt imagine my parents reaction if I told them honestly about my situation.

Truth be told, there is only one thing stopping me from putting a bullet in my head (I have a firearm, which only makes ending myself more tempting): itâs the story of one of my good friends.

About 9 months ago, one of my friends killed themselves. I went to their funeral, and the WORST thing I have ever witness in my life was his parents dealing with the shock of suddenly losing a son. Iâve never seen a human being suffer as much as his parents. Thinking about it now makes me want to vomit. I saw his mother and father weep uncontrollably for hours. It fucked me up. 

The ironic thing is: if it wasnât for my friend hanging himself, it probably wouldâve been me. This fact only makes me more fucked up about his death. 

Iâve called the suicide hotline several times tonight with no answer, so fuck it; hereâs my throwaway accountâs desperate plea for help. 

I donât want to die, I just feel like Iâm leaking pain constantly and there is nothing I can do to stop it. 

Death seems preferable to whatâs happening now."

"Recurring thoughts of suicide, not intense, but could be. How do I make this stop?I am the average 21 year old having issues finding value in myself during my time of growth.  I find myself depending on others for my happiness sometimes, and I'm still learning to be happy for myself.  I have had a bad history of suicidal thoughts, leading to 2 apprehensions by police due to intent of suicide, a restraining order, and multiple visits to the ER.  These events occurred over 2 years ago, I am much better now, but I still get the occasional thoughts of worthlessness and suicide.  Not as intense as my previous episodes, but I'm having a bit of an accompanying issue now.

It's the usual relationship issues, where I fear my sig. other will leave me, due to my insecurities.  She knows of my dark past, so nowadays I try to keep these thoughts away from her, as I know it affects the people around me, so I keep it to myself.  I don't want to burden the people around me, and this has to be something I tackle by myself.  

I guess I came to this sub to seek comfort or advice, because lately my head has been a hell that I have been battling by myself.  I have been seeking help at my school's resource center and I have been seeing the school counselors and therapists, which have been helping, but when I'm alone and sitting here sinking in my thoughts, I drown.  I constantly fear the worst, and right now, I fear losing my girlfriend because of these insecurities.  I feel like I'm losing her when she sees that I'm down, and I can't explain what I'm thinking because it will affect her.

I feel that I'm stuck in a loop where I end up facing things on my own, and I drown in this hell where all I think about is how much this world would benefit from me not being here.

"I think I'm going to try it tomorrowBackground: this isn't my first rodeo. I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was 12 and 14 years later they're coming up again, louder than ever.

When I heard about Chester Bennington and his history of abuse I learned that we were victimized at the same ages. His music was life support when I was young, and I can't shake the idea that this is just what happens when your life was too hard to deal with as a kid. I have 3 degrees in psychology but still can't get this to stop. And really that's all I want at this point, not to be stuck in this body and mind anymore.

I lost my job due to depression, lost my partner for similar reasons, survived a car crash but it fucked with my brain, and that's just the past 2 years. I haven't been able to pick myself up and find a life worth living. Instead I keep treading water. No matter how many job apps I put out or plans I make for the future, it doesn't pan out. It feels like the end of the road, and all I want is an end to the suffering.

Tomorrow I'm going to a show to see one of my favorite bands. I've been using this show as a reason to hang on for the past couple months -  it's silly, but it's been working. But when it's over, there's not a whole lot else to keep me here and I figure if I'm still unhappy at the end of the night then what the hell is the point of holding on.

If it comes to that tomorrow night, I'm going to try hanging myself with a bedsheet slip knotted to the doorknob, thrown over top and slip knotted again around the neck. I've gotten into the set-up before just to see if it would hold and it does. I worry about my cat since it's just me and her and I don't want to cause her pain not having her owner around (she's very attached). But in the end it's either going to be her or me who goes first...it's inevitable. 

I don't know why I'm telling you any of this. I'm just so alone and it would be good to feel heard, I guess."

"Im Just Waiting...Everyday I go on with nothing happening in my life... Im honestly just a waste of talents on a body that doesnt want to live... Here is what Im capable of:

3)Technology loves me and I love it
4) Have an athletic body (but I dont play sports)
5) intermediate level archer

But do all those things keep me from living? No. Its my family. If I do kill myself (which I really want to do) My sister and mom and step dad and even my closest friends wouldnt be right in the head anymore. I cant do that to them..

So im waiting. Im waiting til I get older and be able to honestly make my decisions. I dont know how im going to take myself out but im going to do it thats no doubt. Ive already tried 4 times and the feelings is like a rush of adrenaline that never leaves your body! And that feeling is amazing. When I get older im going to have that feeling again, then never have it again.

So say what you want I might take it into consideration and dont tell me how it will affect my friends and family. I already talked to my closest friends and they arent right in the head when it comes to these things. HELL! One of my friends said they wouldnt mind doing it with me!

i have no clean clothes left but i don't have any money for soap. i'm talking to my best friend in another tab about school stuff. she's gonna be so pissed. i want to tell her that the fire just became too hot and i really don't have any other choice but to jump out the window (i just read that quote).

i'm smiling right now because of a funny askreddit thread and it's scaring me a little. i'm always smiling at a time like this. my aunt just came in and she probably thought i look happy. i don't want to die, you know? i want to commit suicide even less. i want to live and go to college and fight some more with my friends just like what i was doing before all this. there's just really no other exit, you know? i tried looking. i really did, for years. i've never really gone this far with this, you know? so i guess it's really happening."

HiI dont know if this is what I think it is. I'm not gonna kill myself at least I dont think I will. I'm so uncertain whether I will or will not. I'm not sure what to expect from this post I dont think I really care. The thoughts of taking my own life haunts me and it's a beautiful day to die. I've attempted the taking of my own life once by taking a handful of sleep aid medications 17 to be exact yet I couldn't even do that right. My world is always breaking and reality only gets heavier. I've loved and lost time and time again damn the fool who believed it's better to have loved than not at all. I dont think I will kill myself because the thought of not being in the same plane of existence as her cuts deeper than the knife that screams at me. I've reached out to friends and all too busy despite how hard it was for me to try. I'm scared to go to family less I look a fool and cry before them and I'll never go back to the hospital because it's easier to die than commit financial suicide. I loved you all
"Slow burn.My 29th birthday is next month. 

I don't really want to live anymore. I've always been a depressed person, but I've always had good reasons to keep on going with my life, or at least, I used to have things that made me feel alive. I used to make music with my friends, and I used to have friends. Lots of bad ones, and a handful of true friends. Over the last ten years, a lot of them have changed, moved, or just plain moved on. I totally destroyed my friendship with my best friend, claiming stupid reasons that weren't real. 

I have never believed that I would live past 30. For the past six years or so, I have been withdrawing from the people around me and self destructing pretty heavily with drugs and alcohol. I decided to quit my band, give up on being creative, and withdraw from any part of the community. It wasn't just some weird purposeful thing. I also felt really alienated from everybody. When surrounded by so many of my peers enjoying the fruits of their long, hard effort, it's depressing to sit back and think of all of my failures. Eventually, I went too far on drugs, having at least a couple of near death experiences. The only person in my life I really want to live for is my mom.

After those, I decided to see a doctor to get on antidepressants. Before I made that decision, I was suffering heavily from anxiety attacks, and I would cry myself to sleep every night knowing that I purposefully fucked up my life. I hate myself. I have always hated myself. When I look in the mirror, I am disgusted with my body. I hate the way that I use people, and I hate that I have lost my ability to connect to anyone. I don't even think I really love my mom or any of my friends anymore. All I can think about is my disgust and self loathing, the pain of being alive and feeling like an outsider no matter where I go or what I do, or feeling like I'm not good enough for anything. 

Since I went on antidepressants, I no longer cry myself to sleep and I am able to function. I feel little to nothing 90% of the time. The ten percent of the time I do feel anything, it is regret for the family, friendships, and relationships I have thrown away. I spend most of my time either throwing myself into my job to the point that it affects my life in a negative way, or distracting myself with TV or video games. 

I do not feel like I can make a connection with another person in a meaningful way. I am not a social person. The only thing in my life that really makes me feel loved at all is my cat. I had another cat that I felt that way about who died a couple of years ago; it was devastating because it was the only living thing that I really was able to bond with and love. This inability to bond with other human beings and the hatred I have for myself make me want to take as much prescription medication as I have available with as much alcohol as I can drink, or seek out enough opiates to die a peaceful death in my sleep after taking enough Ambien. 

I have thought long and hard about killing myself over the past 13 years, but there has always been some silver lining to keep me going. I have given up on my dreams to go to school to do something I'm not really sure about. I have severed all my social ties in the town that I currently live. I have no friends to talk to anymore. The only person I really feel horrible about hurting is my mother. The pain of being tired and alone is just getting to be too much. Even with antidepressants, there are days when I can just barely get the motivation to breathe. 

I'm just so tired. I don't want another year, and I don't want another ten, or twenty, or forty. I just want to let go of everything and end the pain of being alive and alone. I don't want to continue on the path I'm on in the world we live in. This is a terrible place and I am a terrible person."
"Cape HornCape Horn is a small vantage point along Hwy 14 that overlooks the Columbia River. During summer it is beautiful. At night the stars come through clear and for being such a small place, it's one of my favorites. Tonight, it's rainy, the roads are pooled with standing water, and there is a lot of low hanging fog. Visibility is low. I have been sitting here for maybe 20 minutes. I've seen one car pass by. A Sheriff's Deputy. Ironic. 

A month ago or so, my girlfriend of almost a year left me. Unbeknownst to me, she wasn't happy anymore. She hadn't been for a long while. I am not sensitive enough to her. I'm rude. I would call her names. I was a genuine piece of shit. But what's worst, I didn't even know I was doing it. Most of the time if crack jokes and whatnot not realizing that she was taking them to heart. She was a perfect girlfriend. She loved my kid. My kid loves her. She was good to me and did more than I ever could've asked her to. I have been in many relationships. I've been cheated on, lied to, treated like shit, used; you name it. This is the worst of them all. I had a nice planned with her. We had dreams together. She was my entire life. I knew her better than anyone ever had, and I let her in more than I'd ever let anybody. We were perfect for each other. But because I couldn't pull my head out of my ass, and she spent so much time trying to make it work and be happy on her own, she lost it. I had one moment of shit judgement that I regret every day that pushed her over the edge. She fell out of love with me after that. I'd do anything in the world to change it, and I've tried my hardest and promised her that it would change but unfortunately it's just too late.

A month later, she's moving on. She has found someone else that is making her happy the way I should've. They aren't together and she swears to me that she just wants to be single and be happy by herself, and I can respect that. But I can see where it's going. They do things that we used to do. She is happy around him. I don't know him, don't know what he looks like, or anything about him. What I do know is that he will never love her the way I do. He will never care about her the way I do, he will never want to give her the world or worry that she's okay... She will just get hurt, and I can't do anything about it because I blew my chance. 

I know that it's pathetic to be like this over a girlfriend, but I promise that she was much more to me than that. She was my first real love. 15 years of relationships and I had found my one. My twin flame. 

Back to now, I've had 3 trucks, 4 cars, and 1 semi pass by. My pistol has been sitting in my lap since I parked here. It's probably been about 45 minutes by now. I know I have things to live for, but everything seems meaningless now knowing that I've lost her. I do not enjoy any of my hobbies. She is on my mind all the time. I think about her all day and dream about her all night. When I see my little girl, her face lights up and the first thing she asks is where her stepmomma is. I've gone through a lot in my life, but this is the hardest thing by a long fucking shot and I'm off the deep end. She is the only thing that's ever been able to quiet my demons and put my soul at ease. And she knows this. Even now she is texting me. She has no idea that I came out here with a partial intention to blow my brains out. I figured I'd see how I feel when I got here and go from that. 

I have plenty of friends and family to talk to about this, but no matter what I do I always feel alone. I am lost. My purpose has been stolen from me and I can't carry on anymore. When I wake up every day, my first thought is anger, because I didn't die in my sleep. Call me selfish. Call me pathetic. But honestly I wish I had the fucking balls to pull the trigger. 

If you love someone, you never fucking let go. "
Will I be happy when I'm dead?I've never been happy in life.  Will I be happy in death?
"My Nasty Sister Is Borrowing My Books And I Am Flipping Out I donât like her. I wouldnât call her a girl, because well, girls donât make you repulsed. Some are more pretty then others, but overall, I havenât seen a girl that made me repulsed and want to evacuate,  but I have seen such a sister. 

I canât explain why I donât like her, but I think she is nasty. Could he how she was young, but at the same time I have simped on girls her age before, so itâs likely not. Could he a natural repulsion or something mental, but I just know I hate her.

Well yesterday, she tried to borrow some books. I kept her from doing that. I screamed at her to put them back with all my might and ability, until my thought was sore. She ended up surrendering and putting them back, crying. Like WTF you were antagonizing me and then you cry when I put a stop to it.  I felt proud for protecting my books from her nastiness.  

Well I couldnât protect them for long, because today my parents made me give her a book or Iâd lose my phone. I actually opted to give up my phone to protect them. They realized their tricks wouldnât work and just instead gave her the book even when I insisted they take my phone instead.  

Now all I can think about is how she is touching them with her nasty-ass grubby hands and it will now smell like her. I kid you not, she has a smell. It isnât a BO smell or typical nasty smell, she has a typical smell. That smell is naturally bad and smelly because it is associated with her.

I try to avoid breathing the same air as her. In the car with her, I sit close to air vents and breath air straight from the vents to avoid the recycled âher airâ because I donât want to share air with her.

My family insists sheâs my sister but I refuse to recognize that. She is simply not good enough to qualify as a sister in my books"

"I can't seem to find happiness anymore...I always feel like such a failure, and right now everything is going incredibly wrong. I'm about to fail two of my college courses and I feel like I've wasted this entire semester. Last year I didn't graduate with my class, and I thought I was finally moving on and I was going to be doing well again. I had a 3.5 GPA my first semester of college, and now I'm struggling to pass this semester. Every time I feel like I'm finally doing something right, I go and screw it all up... I'm fighting with my best friend because we don't fit together anymore. He's everything I need in my life, he makes me feel happy. But we keep arguing and stupid things keep getting in the way and we need space from each other, and I need him so much right now...
My future is just... doomed. I can't seem to do anything right. I try so hard, but it's never enough...

During the day, I think about taking a gun and sending a single bullet through my temple and making all the pain go away. It's so vivid. It feels like such a relief... I know I'd do it if we had a gun here, but we don't...  I can't seem to make the pain go away. I can't seem to see any light at the end of the tunnel. And the temporary happiness just isn't enough for me. I need happiness that will last... I can't find happiness here. I can't find it anywhere.

I just want to feel okay again. But I don't believe I ever actually will..."
"I'm beginning to formulate a plan. The end may be near.I don't know why I'm posting this, really. I guess it's to feel the only thing I truly wanted before ending my life. I wanted to feel like someone cared, but more than that, I wanted to feel love. I wanted to be a teammate to someone and lift them up while they do that for me. I don't really see that in my future, and I don't want to work towards a future anymore. I'm too fucking lonely to keep going. Everything is too fucking hard. I'm going to make it easy for myself to give up.

My plan is to collect the inheritance I'm owed by the state, notarize a will to leave it to someone I love, and use a suicide bag to cease to exist. At least in this way, someone I care about will benefit from my death, I will no longer be a burden on others, and I won't have to feel the pain I deal with on a daily basis.

The method will be painless and without a sense of panic. I'll simply slip away and be gone forever. No one needs to worry about any suffering I'll feel because there will be none; I'll be stopping all pain forever.

I refuse to blame the world for the way that I feel and to attempt to take revenge on an unfair world. All I ever wanted was love, and I never really got it the way I wanted, but that doesn't mean I need to take that out on the world. The world doesn't owe me love. I never should've existed to begin with.

I guess I'm posting here for a number of reasons. Mainly, I want to leave something somewhere so I can get these feelings out and have them somewhere just in case I actually go through with it.

I've been considering this for a while now, and I'm getting closer and closer to doing it. There's a few things I need to arrange, but they're things that are going to happen whether I do it or not. That will only make it easier for me to do it.

I wish things could've turned out better, but I don't know if I can see myself ever being happy. And if I can be happy, I don't know that I want to go through all the bullshit in order to get there.

All I wanted was to love and to be loved. All I wanted was to have a teammate, friends, and a job that could provide a moderately decent existence. This seems more and more impossible/difficult. I feel more and more that I just want to give up.

I'm probably going to kill myself no matter what; the question is if I'll do it now or when my body begins to give in. I don't know if I want to suffer the emotional pain until my body decides it's time to go.

I'm on the edge, and I may not survive."

"Why am I so useless?People out there exist, one's that have to worry about not eating certain things because it might cause a negative reaction in their body that causes them to die, one's that can't learn effectively because they interpret words differently not because of their own fault but because somewhere in their DNA is a disease that causes them to read words differently than other people, one's that live in an environment so cruel it would be punishment to any sentient being. And here I am, a human with no bounds, one that was not abused growing up, one who could never say I'm hungry and there is nothing to eat, one that could not proclaim that there was something educational I could not afford because my parents made every effort for me to be able to learn anything I wanted to. To be able to amount to anything. And here I am, nothing, that's all I'm worth, nothing. I have failed not only myself but society, through my stupidity I have failed the people that cannot afford to learn something they do not know, the ones that would wish with all their might to be able to learn something, anything, to be able to propel their species forward, but cannot because they are denied the resources to do some. I had all the resources, I had all the chances, I had every single opportunity afforded to me by society and what did I do you might ask? I squandered it away like the stupid impulsive creature I am. I could not look towards the future and determine that I had something to offer to this world other than a body that would eventually decay to feed the earth. Had I done everything correctly there is no doubt in my mind that I could have contributed to society. I could have helped somebody that had not eaten in weeks become better. I could have been valuable to society. I would never be indispensable but I could have become a nice cog to the machine dubbed humanity. Instead I live my life in the days that could have been. The days that should have been. The only thing I currently deserve is death and even then torture is the only way I could ever hope to possibly amount to the sins that I have committed. I offer nothing to this world and shouldn't be in it as a result. "

"I feel toxic.I have had depression, anxiety and panic attacks since I was 17. When I'm my normal self, I'm kind, I try to make people laugh, I care, I'm interesting. I'm great at socializing and communicating. Then I panic, sometimes it's alcohol or drug induced. I become a completely different person, I can be abusive and nosy, go through peoples phones, get paranoid. 

A common element to suicidal people is that they feel like they have been wronged by the world, but I just feel that I'm always the one to fuck things up for people. My ex would often tell me that I ruined trips by getting panic attacks and harassing her while drunk. Every time I talk about my feelings to people, they initially show great support, but in the end they always get drained of their energy and they need to leave. People often block me for this. This is the biggest source of panic for me, when someone informs me that they're going to block me, I go fucking insane. I try to will myself into suicide then and there but it never works.

I can't convince myself I'm a victim of anything but my own selfish, toxic, unhinged, moronic actions that drive people away and make me look like a reprehensible piece of shit, and I want to leave my city, find somewhere quiet and die. I've made a plan to leave quite soon, inform only my family, find somewhere, get so drunk that I can't turn back and then jump off of something tall or go in front of a train, something I can't back out of. I am not feeling suicidal right this moment but I have made the plan."

I think the only thing that will keep me alive is by doing something incredibly irresponsible and just leaving. I don't have any kids or pets or anything, but it still feels irresponsible somehow. I feel like the only way I can stay alive is to just throw my life away, if that makes any sense at all. To be invisible, incapable of talking to anyone who knew me. To truly disappear and start over in the kind of way that is simply impossible normally. Something that would force me to fight to stay alive. I think I may just disappear and never return. South America maybe, or somewhere in Asia. I'd probably end up get myself killed, but that's kind of the point.

Different will be okay. Different will hardly remember me. Different will move on. Different will be okay. Different will continue with its life. Different will be free. Different won't have an obligation. Different won't feel 'tied down'. Different won't be embarrassed about me. Different won't need me to depend on it. Different blames me. I believe you different. You are immune. You don't do anything wrong. 

Thank you for pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing. It broke. It shattered. I broke. I shattered. 

I can't live. I can't escape. I can control this.

Please don't do what I'm about to do.

"A waste.I feel like my life has been a complete waste. I donât want to kill myself Per se. However at the same time I hope and pray everyday that I wonât wake up on the next. I hate existing. I hate being. All my friends have surpassed me, financially, emotionally, life has continued to progress for them. And for me it has not. And I know that it is my fault, so Iâm not mad at anybody. But I just hope I die very soon. Life is horrible and I donât want to be apart of it anymore. "
"so... where should I go online to just... not be alone?At the moment, suicide doesn't seems like a viable option. And really, I feel too old to even be feeling this way... but it's sort of always been there, and it never leaves, not really. And the night is young, and the bottle is not yet empty.  

But I can't keep sitting here alone. It leads to - well I won't post specifics. I don't want to put that in anyone's head. Just places I have no business being.

So, where do you go online to not be alone? DO you have a place?
There used to be a chat room I visited, and I rarely typed anything, but it was just nice to feel like there were people here with me, you know? But they closed the room, and I'm unsure how to find anything else like that. "

"I'm so tired... Tired of always fightingMy life has always been a fight. I was the chubby boy and got picked on. I would ask for help but basically told to fend for myself. when I would finally snap I would be the one in trouble. My step dad fucked me and my brother up mentally. My bro is recently locked up and fried is brains from drug use. Me. I did what I was supposed to. graduate, work and take care of my responsibilities. I've always have suicidal thoughts since I was 6-7. I'm 35 now. I remember threatening to kill myself at that age and for some reason my step dad would scare me and say he would dig up my body and shoot me. Which scared me even more then the thought of dying. I first got jumped when I was 6 walking home. From that age till about 10 I started just fighting whoever picked on me. I didn't care if I lost or got in trouble I knew I had to have my own back. I grew up alone I really don't have friends.. well I lie. I have NO friends at all. As an adult life didn't get any better. My ex wife accused me of molesting our daughter when she was 6 out of hate. I fought and won 2 federal cases which fucked me up. I'm a native and I don't get along with my family at all.  All my people, I don't know, I can't get along with them. Let me say I am respected, I'm the one people run to when they need help or someone to talk to. I've taken many people in and protected them too. I gave homeless people my last few dollars because I figure they needed it more then me. I'm respectful I refer to people as sir and ma'am. I am the one always smiling. Recently I was targeted. The cops showed up at my house randomly saying they smelt cannabis from my house. Now I do use but not at home. I got arrested. So did my girlfriend. They took our kids. I had zero cannabis in my residence. Only empty containers that I cleaned out and paraphernalia. Now my 2 kids. They tried to say my kids were stoned and we're scared for their lives and that they reeked. I got 4 charges and I'm not allowed to see my kids and neither is my gf. We miss our sons 2nd birthday sitting in jail. My gf she doesn't deserve this. She doesn't drink or smoke. We take care of our kids. We have never spent more then 2 days away from them because we don't depend on people to watch them. We are always with our kids on main reason or daughter doesn't talk at all and is disabled. My gf doesn't want to stay at the house without the kids and I don't blame her. I'm here alone with just memories. It's been a week since it happened and I haven't slept more than 8 hours. I tried sleeping pills and so far I got an hour. My GFS charges has a good possibility of getting dropped because her public defender is good at his job. Me... Idk. Idk anything anymore. I'm tired. When I'm alone all I've been doing is crying missing my kids and family. I feel trapped like I can't escape. I'm tired. I don't want to fight this I'm ready to give up. My body is tired. I can't do it mentally anymore. I just wanna sleep. I don't want to cry anymore. This time it's looking at 20 years. I should take comfort that everyone has our back and have been nothing but supportive. But like I keep saying I'm tired I don't want to fight anymore. I can't do it my body and brain can't take it. I've been crying for 2 hours straight and can't stop. Miss my kids so much. But their dad is nothing but a curse. As long as I exist their going to be cursed because of what happens to me. I didn't care if it was just me who had to suffer but not my family. I'm not scared of death. For some reason suicide thoughts have been giving me strange comfort."

"How long/bad is the greiving process for family members of suicide victims?I'm pretty much done with living, I have MDD and severe OCD and have exhausted all my treatment options. I am completed isolated by my disorder and I want to die. I have come to the realization that my life will be unnecessary struggle sprinkled with random moments of happiness, and that's just not good enough for me. The only thing that has held me back is my parents as I don't want to ruin their lives, but I'm realizing now that it's my life and my choice to end it. I'm curious to know if the grieving process is difficult and how long it takes for ppl to get over suicide, because if it's a difficult process, I want to alleviate their pain in my note when I'm gone."

Do any other leftists sit alone at the cafeteria during lunch time at school? I'm a proud leftist and have voiced my hatred for donald trump and the republican party during multiple classes. I feel like my classmates just aren't ready for views like mine. Is anyone else having the same experiences I am? I wish I could live in a state like California or Texas where I could be around more leftists like myself!

"I can't go on anymore. I don't feel safe in my own home.Hello. My name is N and I'm 16, female. And I want to die so desperately. My parents and brother are all abusive. Today, I felt very sick and had to stay at home. My mom got very confrontational and yelled at me while almost forcing me to go to school and then my brother came in and grabbed me by  my wrists and twisted my arms. For some background, I come from a Chinese family and my parents basically own me and my decisions, especially about my future. I love photography, but my parents want me to become a surgeon or something. Any way, my mom yelled very abusive things to me and basically beat me down with her words while my brother went on a rampage through the house, ransacked my room, and flipped the kitchen table with food still on it. I threatened to call 911, but I didn't. I don't know why I didn't. I guess I'm just too afraid of everyone finding out (because to everyone we seem relatively normal, and none of my friends know) and I'm afraid of losing all that I'm used to. I got to stay at home though, and I rested for awhile. But then my dad came home, and heard the lies of my mom and brother. He is the most physically abusive of the family (my brother learns from him) and thus he slapped me on the face three times while I cried and begged him to stop. Sorry if this all is badly written, I'm just in a very bad emotional state now. He took away my phone (so that I can't call for help) and camera (which isn't really his anyway). I went downstairs after asked for those back nicely, but he started to threaten to hit me more and kill me. He yelled at me more. I feel very scared and I don't want to go to school tomorrow, but I feel that I have to. I'm also hesitant about calling 911 or any number for help, as I'm worried I'll be killed before I get any help. I don't feel like living any more. My school year hasn't started out well and I don't have any friends close enough to turn to. Everyone thinks of me as the perfect student...and I'm worried of what they'll think if I tell them about my home situation...I don't know. Again sorry if my writing is weird. I just wanted to let this all out. I'm really scared. 

Any ideas as to what I can do? I'm from Ontario, Canada by the way, so if there are any places I can go to or numbers I can call, please help me out. Thank you so much."
"This is just a stupid rant about how much I pity myself and Iâve spent all day doing fucking nothing and I hate itIâm falling apart and have been for much too long. Yesterday I left work early for fear of having a mental breakdown and today I called in. 

Yesterday when I got home I bought cigarettes. Been trying to quit, but arenât we all. It was nice outside so I just sat for a while. You know that depressed daze where all you can think about is how shit everything is and you just want to die? I just kept myself sitting there because I knew if I just sat there I wouldnât be able to kill myself. I had a few hours until my bf got home and Iâd be safe from myself, so until then I just sat. 

While I was sitting, a little boy who lives in my apartment building was outside with his mother. He was ecstatically playing and exploring. He couldnât have been more than 2. He ran right up to me, oblivious to the horrible pain I was experiencing, and said, âHi! How are you?â I could barely understand him, I donât think he knows many words yet. How am I? Man I was dumbfounded. Finally I found words and broke out of my daze, at least for a second. âIâm good, how are you?â His mother smiled and told him to say, âIâm fine!â After that he ran off and she went after him. Iâm glad I had sunglasses on because the encounter made me burst into tears. I was so jealous of that boy, he seemed so happy. I also felt terrible for him because one day his innocence will be ripped away and he will discover the horrible state of this world weâre living in. On top of it, hardly anyone knows Iâm feeling this way, but he just seemed to know. I mean he obviously didnât, but I swear his eyes were asking me if I was okay, if he could help me. It was so strange.

Today I called in and I feel terribly guilty. Iâve just been sitting around my apartment trying to convince myself that itâs okay to take a day to take care of myself. Except Iâm not taking care of myself. I havenât eaten, Iâve smoked far too many cigarettes, and Iâm afraid to move for fear Iâll just go grab a razor blade and slit my wrists or take my belt out of the closet to hang myself. 

I know I need to go to work tomorrow. I need to stop taking sick days just to mope around. Iâm going to try to go in early tomorrow to catch up. Iâm going to try to stick it through, no leaving early, and Iâm going to try not to cry at any point during the day. Holy fuck itâs gonna be hard though. I just feel like a worthless piece of shit. 

My bf will be home in a few hours again. Iâm just gonna hug him and cry. I was hoping today would be a day to help me feel better, but I think I only made it worse. I keep thinking Iâm going to get chewed out by my boss tomorrow, but thatâs completely unrealistic, right? We have sick days so we can take them when we need them, and if Iâm feeling this way I definitely needed one, right? Iâm just trying to justify my dumbass fucking feelings and actions. I donât know what to do anymore, Iâm just a ball of anxiety and pain and I want it to stop."

I don't truly know if I want to do it, but I've started thinking about it so much that I feel I have only two options; go through with it when my closest friends are in California w/o me, or see someone so I can get hospitalized. I haven't self-harmed in a while, but I don't want to start again soon because I know that I'll feel like my decision will have been made the second I cut."

-Christopher made metal albums in the early 2010s. Lol.

"Spending the next week as my lastI don't really know where to start besides that I should have been dead almost two years ago and due to unforseen circumstances my life was inadvertantly saved. I apologise if it's very jumbled. I just have a lot of thoughts right now and that's all this really is. For now.

 About two years ago I had gotten back from a deployment and about the last couple months of it, I started to feel really depressed. Nothing I used to like to do was any fun or held any substance for me anymore. Working out, doing anything I used to love to do. It was out of nowhere really. The day I got back I saw my wife waiting there in the rain for me and she was so excited to see me, jumped on me and hugged me yada yada. I didn't feel much though. No excitement, nothing. Well this continued on and I had lost all my drive for anything, work, play etc. I lost all motivation. Anyways a little ways down the road my wife lost her father and things changed between us. A couple months later, for 13 days (I counted) she wouldn't even give me the time of day. Wouldn't talk to me, acknowledge me and was all around apprehensive to be around me. Then one night she just asks me if I still loved her and was happy in the marriage. I said yes of course, and I honestly was and still wanted to be with her, but her answer was opposite of course. 
   
So fast forward and we split, soon thereafter I went to an advanced course for my job, Sapper Leaders. I had wanted to go on that course so bad for so long but not this time. I was still unmotivated to do anything but I did my best and I earned my castle after that grueling course, one of only 8 people out of a class that had started with 40 something. Nonetheless I was still unhappy. That same night I had gotten home and was prepared to off myself with the shotgun that was in my bedroom. Well come to find out, she took it with her to where she moved while I was at the course. So I didn't do it. I decided to see what happens for a while and maybe I'd decide I want to keep living idk. Well my life took a turn for the worse. I became a very bad alcoholic. I drank every single night, from the moment I got off work until 3 AM and would wake up at 4 AM to go to work still hammered. That turned into me totaling multiple vehicles from drunk driving and one DUI. I would blackout multiple times a week and do nothing but go to the bar, play pool and drink my nights away. Hooking up with random females and barely remembering my days. All while I was still active duty. 

 My command could tell I was having problems but only one person out of them bothered to try to help me. Which nothing came of the help because I was basically told by a Psychiatrist that I was beyond help because I didn't know what caused my depression at the start and the divorce only worsened what I was already feeling. So this continued until I got that 1 DUI and I was put into a 5 week rehab program. Didn't drink a single drop that whole time, and nothing changed. I was still sad and didn't want to live. Still unmotivated to do my job, to teach my juniors anything even though I was one of the best ones in the platoon for it. Anyways, after the 5 weeks I was still on restriction (can't leave the barracks and have to report every two hours to the officer of the day until 10 PM, starting at 6 AM). I decided fuck it, I hadn't drank for 45 days and only had 15 days left of restriction, I'm gonna break restriction tonight and go have a few drinks and be back before 6 AM ready to go. Bad move, I ended up so hammered that I broke into a ford dealership just down the road, destroyed some shit and fell asleep in their garage. Woke up to some officers asking if I knew where I was at. I didn't, they arrested me and told me what I did and saw the video. I had no memory of it, still don't. 
  Anyways I bailed myself out of jail and was discharged within the next week, at my original discharge date and honorably still at that. I was lucky and my command did not take action against me for any of it. I stayed around the same town and kept going out. I ended up hooking up with one girl I had my eye on for a while. We were together for a couple of months and I swear I had never been happier in my life. She's perfect, gorgeous and so much fun. She matches my energy so well. Yet, I had decided that I wanted to move. Only 3 hours away though so I figured I could go see her throughout the week and we could stay together. That was not the case, she decided she didn't want that and blocked me on everything. There I was heartbroken again. 

 That one really did a number on me. I had moved and I stopped drinking all together. This is now more recent. This all happened over the span of less than two years, from separating from my wife to now. I moved to VA with a friend of mine and did my thing there for a bit. Still unhappy with how things are. I then started seeing another girl from the previous city that I lived in and would go see her now and then, we weren't official but I liked her a lot. She recently moved and I went to see her. Things weren't the same though, she was very apprehensive around me and the energy was totally off. Kind of felt like negative energy towards me. So I left the very next day. I then decided that on my way back that I would take a little vacation for myself and see what's out there in the other states. I stayed in Arkansas for a few days, went to some state park and it was beautiful. Did some partying, just living it up. Stayed somewhere in Illinois for a night too. I decided that it's my last ditch effort to try to have some fun again. Before I go. 

Here's what I haven't really said. Any time I go out, I usually go out alone. I do a lot of things alone, always have. Go to the bar, strip club whatever. Out to eat, alone, anything I do is usually by myself. I do have friends and always did so I'm not your usual loner. I actually prefer to do things by myself, I don't really know why. I'm usually pretty private and keep a lot of things to myself and I always have, always will. I would go out with friends here and there because it does get lonely sometimes always going by myself but at the same time, any time I would go with my friends it was always me asking them and not them asking me. With an acception of 2  people who would ask me here and there as well. I find that I would meet a lot more people and make some good acquaintances when I would be by myself. It was fun for me. I do get tired of not being thought of though. It has always been like that, I'm always the first to text or check on someone, or see if they want to hang out. It sucks. I'm more of a popular loner, I know a ton of people and we're all cool with each other and hangout when I'm around but no one hits me up when I'm gone. 

   Anyways I've been hurting for the past two years, and should have been dead so many times Idek anymore. Around 6, but every time I walk away from said situations without a scratch. Like the luckiest unlucky person that I know. I've caused myself so much pain and I'm tired of not enjoying anything anymore. Not like I would have time to enjoy anything if I did because I'm probably going back to jail soon because of what I did the last time I was blackout drunk, breaking into that dealership. For some reason I thought I might have enjoyed life if I stayed alive to see what happened but I've done nothing but wreak havoc on my own life and cause a lot of pain, isolation and loneliness. Even without drinking I still do have very bad self damaging habits. I don't enjoy life anymore and to be honest it is very underwhelming and boring to me. Nothing really excites me anymore or satisfies me. I can't even be satisficed (The idea that something isn't exactly satisfying but also not unsatisfying). I find no substance in my life and I feel like I have nothing left to offer the world nor does it to me. I just want to be gone. I just want some peace, to get out of my own head. I don't really have a reason to be here anymore and I'm tired of being a nuisance not only to myself but others too. I figure this will be my last week here, and I'll enjoy what I can. 

Sorry for being so long."
"Iâm doneI want to die so bad, but it seems almost impossible. I donât have a car or a license. I live in Canada, so it would be almost impossible to get a gun. I live in a small town, so jumping off a building or a bridge doesnât seem very logical. Iâve attempted to overdose on pills multiple times, but itâs really hard to actually die from overdosing on pills. Iâve tried hanging myself, but that didnât work at all, and thereâs nothing really in my house to use. Iâm tried cutting myself with both razors and knives, but nothing in my house is really sharp enough to do it. Again, Iâve tried almost everything, but the only option is jumping in front of a vehicle or train. However, Iâd have to leave the house, and since I donât go out much, my family would probably call 911. Thereâs also no guarantee that it would kill me, and I might be permanently disabled or lose a few limbs. I just want the pain to stop and want everyone to stop treating me like crap, and actually give a shit about me. Iâm fat, ugly, short, dumb, and I know I have no future. I really wish assisted suicide for mentally ill people was a thing in my country, as I feel itâs unfair for a person to be forced to live for selfish reasons. I know people would say âyour friends and family would careâ. Bullshit, absolute bullshit. My family treat me like crap all the time, and yes they might feel pain for a bit, but they would get over it quickly. I have no real âfriendsâ, Iâve basically lost all of them, and they donât seem to actually give a shit about me. When I text them, they either give one worded replies or they take days to reply or sometimes donât even reply at all. I have no luck finding a partner, as Iâm fat, ugly, dumb, and short. Even if someone will like me, they probably wonât be my type and I wonât be attracted to them (I know Iâm self centred, but I canât help but have a type). The only âthingsâ that will care if Iâm gone is my cats, and they will forget about me in a few days. I wish I could just hire a hitman/just anybody to kill me, but Iâm pretty sure Iâd go to jail for attempting that. I guess I could try suicide by cop, but that might just end up with my injured or in handcuffs. Iâm really tired of living, and really wish every single day that I would just die. I really donât know what to do. Also, donât say âtalk to a psychiatrist or therapistâ because I have, and it never helps. No therapist or psychiatrist will fix how others treat me and how I feel mentally and physically."
"it seems comfortablesomething being dead just seems so warm and pleasant and comfortable

like those extra fifteen minutes of laying in bed i give myself after my alarm goes off, pretending everything else doesn't have to exist for fifteen minutes more. except it would be forever

it seems comfortable and peaceful and everyone is convinced i shouldn't want that?"
I have done everything I can think ofAll I want is for you to give me some attention sometimes. You know how important you are to me. Why canât you make an effort? Why am I in the wrong if I get insecure? Youâre the one that never talks to me. Itâs not fair. I know you wonât miss me. So thereâs no reason for me to stay. Nothing gets better. I knew it was stupid to think that I was anything more than just a distraction until you felt better and could find someone better. Iâm sorry Iâm not good enough.

"No Longer CopingFor a while now (between 1 and 10 years, don't want to give exact time in case I ever end up talking to someone irl about it) I've randomly felt really terrible about everything. It comes and goes, sometimes I'm fine, sometimes not (fine much more often than not). In the last 2 weeks though I've been feeling terrible for no good reason, but unlike every other time I'm not exactly coping with it. I'm eating noticebly less, have way less energy (my cycling commute is taking about twice as long), I've been holding back tears in day to day life rather than being able to hide it all well. I can't focus any more, what should have been a 2 hours college assignment has taken about 5 so far with so signs of being completed any time soon. It feels a little better just typing this, but I'm dtill totally lost.

EDIT: To add if it wasn't clear, I've felt simiar before but only now have I been unable to hide it and stop it affecting every day life. That's why I'm getting a bit scared."

so basically it's just askin me to analyze two quotes ? or is it asking me to analyze the two quotes in relation to britain and free trade. please help"
"There's no fucking help.Therapy is a waste of time. I've tried medication after medication and only experienced negative side effects. The suicide hotline is useless.

"My Best Friend of Seven Years Left MeMy grades are going downhill (I go to Community College), and I have a history of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse and abandonement from my family members. What's really devastating me at the moment is my ex-best friend ditching me for another ""best friend."" I've loved him, and still do. In addition to all this, I'm an in-closet gay male.

"Why can't suicide be accepted and easier?I hate this anti suicide culture. All I want is a quick way out and you tell me I'm selfish. Fuck this world. For the record: no one fucking cares about me mate and I don't give a fuck about anyone else. I have no family or anyone so it won't even hurt anyone around me. I'm all for people killing themselves. Stub your toe and you want to die? Dumped by gf and want to die? Fine by me. I don't care. All reasons to suicide are valid IMO.

Here's what sucks about the world:

Wage slave for the rest of your life
People are fake and greedy
Wage slave for the rest of your life
People suck
Wage slave for the rest of your life
Some disease is probably going to fuck you up eventually
You die anyway
People suck
Wage slave for the rest of your life
Humanity can't work together so we're all going extinct soon via global warming
I can go on and on

This world would be much better without society and having to do a shitty job forever, but even then life still sucks. It's mediocre. I see it for what it is. I get it, there's fun and happy moments. But those moments are fleeting. 

I hate how other people dictate my life. Look, I can't afford a gun, or N, or cyanide. I suck at tying ropes. I don't want to jump because it will traumatize others. Drowning seems like a good idea, but I'm not too sure how I'll ever get far away without a boat.

What kinda fucking options are left? Am I seriously forced to jump? Shit even that's not guaranteed to kill you though. I mean I'll take my shot but...

I will try practicing a rope later but... God fucking damn it. Can't I get something, idk, reliable?

Fuck humans man. Fuck life. Why couldn't the universe exist without me? I don't wanna live in this shitty universe. I'm not fucking impressed with any of it. Stars, galaxies, brains, gods. I don't give a fuck. It's all underwhelming and frankly bothersome.

Ao free o c jkckfkfkkdjjrjdkfieisnckwkdkfk2osnlckek yes I'm frustrated. Ima go cut and drink beer. If I can't kill myself then I'll take joy in killing myself slowly. But hangovers really, really suck :(. Cancer is good though. So whatever.

"Don't see the point.I apologize for how rambling and stupid this is probably going to be.  I have been considering posting here for a while, finally figured I may as well. I do not even really know what the point of posting here. None of you know me or ever will so any kind words you will say will be purely hollow, but who knows maybe there will be a catharsis to it. 

Why not begin at the beginning? I actually can recall my first memory, the first time I realized I was some sort of living being consciously. It was before preschool so I was probably 4 maybe? I remember sitting there and crying, what was the point of this? Why am I alive? Not much has changed in my thoughts since then, haha. 

I am absolutely worthless. I have nothing positive to me in any way. I am a subhuman piece of garbage. No, that's not true. Garbage was at least at some point a useful item; even shit was at one point life giving food. I sadly never had the luxury of ever being useful to anyone or anything. No one has ever cared about me and no one ever will. I cannot imagine an existence in which I will ever be happy, where I will ever belong with other people. I have done many things in my life that maybe someone else could be proud of, but I have never felt pride or happiness in anything. I just can't care. 

I can never belong with people. The weird and creepy people that everyone laughs at or doesn't like? Imagine being them. Imagine literally being unable to ever make friends, no matter how nice or outgoing or doing anything you thought it would take to make anyone care, being so disgusting and wretched that no one could even pretend to care about your existence. What's even funnier is even the weirdest people have friends. Even the shittiest person you know has people that they spend time around. I am literally too shitty for anyone. At the start of college I went so long without saying more than a few words to anyone. And that really is a skill. Just like a muscle, it atrophies away. It is a vicious cycle. The sad thing as at the start I thought I was doing well and people may like me, but once again I was wrong. And then it compounds. You don't talk, and then you lose the ability, then you can't talk, you lose even more. I used to be able to speak, now my voice has turned into this stupid fucking whisper and I misspeak all my words and feel like such a fucking moron. And that's when I can even work up the courage to do so. It must be so unimaginable to normal people. When people speak, I have such a hard time being able to say anything. Long ago I learned no one cared what I had to say so I kept it to myself. Now it takes all of my conviction to even say anything aloud. 

I do not know why I had to be born. I wish I hadn't been. Sometimes I tell myself, hey you probably have Klinefelters or hey you probably have autism. You know what? I probably don't. I have no excuse for being the retarded piece of shit that I am.

And then it goes on, I am disgustingly ugly and have struggled with my weight for a long time. And that doesn't mean oh I am just super fat. I have actually struggled. I have gained and lost 100 pounds multiple times in my life. I went from running marathons to literally not being able to run. 

And this, combined with my social retardation, could be worked on and fixed right? That's what makes it even worse. I am the creator of all my problems. That's what's so funny. ""Oh it gets better, your problems will work out."" I AM THE PROBLEM! I am the fucking problem in my life. I could try blaming my parents or my peers or a higher power or anything I could conceive of, but it wasn't them. It was fucking me. I made myself this way, I live my life this way. I am so shitty I can't do anything to ever improve my life. That's what makes it worse. The blame falls on me and I am too much of a retard to ever fix it. I don't blame everyone for fucking hating me and not wanting to be around me. I certainly fucking agree. I wish I could be away from myself. I wish I didn't have to be me either. 

And I think this also ties into another thing. Sometimes girls have given me a chance. It's so funny, they tell me I am so nice and sweet and everything they wanted. And then they spend time with me and get to really know me and realize how fucking shitty I am. I used to tell myself, hey you're a good guy and if they gave you a chance, then they would see that and maybe like you. And years ago I realized that wasn't fucking true. People gave me chances, I was just too fucking shitty to ever belong with them or anyone else. Imagine being so shitty that the second anyone really got to know you at all they were so disgusted they wanted nothing to do with you. And why not discuss sex and things, I am spilling plenty of other stuff. I have very small genitalia which has ever been a source of shame to me. Not only that, I also have penis pimples and two urethra's. But the even better part is that sex does not feel like anything to me. I have had it before and it literally does not stimulate me in any way. My penis has no feeling to it I guess. And even better, my testicle constantly hurts, my urethra burns, and when I ejaculate sometimes it is painful. Urination can be difficult at times and uncomfortable also. Sometimes I feel I was given probably the worst genitals haha, literally nothing works correctly. 

I think I may actually be insane. There was a time a few months ago where I felt I was outside my fucking body and I was walking around and I just had absolutely insane desires to do things I won't describe for risk of possible legal issues or something effecting me in real life. And that doesn't even tie into other things that I may or may not desire that are also absolutely reprehensible but I would never discuss with anyone, not even on this anonymous forum.

I am just absolutely insane. Terrible in every way. I literally have no redeeming factors. Not a single fucking one. I will never be happy. I will never succeed. I will never belong. No one will ever care, especially when they get to see the fucking monster that I really am on the inside that I even lie to myself about. I know I am evil. I do not deserve to live. I should be fucking dead or locked in a cage deep underground. 

I got so close to killing myself many times in my life. I have wanted to do it for probably ten years now. It's so funny, people say it goes away but it never fucking does. I got close one time and I wish I had the fucking balls to do it. But I fail even in that. Some people had ruined my reputation at my school and all my peers hated me and I would just go home every day and write a suicide note in my head, thinking about how it wouldn't even fucking matter. It's so funny to me how other people who are considering suicide says ""oh such and such would miss me, my friends would feel bad."" If I killed myself, no one would even notice let alone care at all. When I was going to kill myself I literally tried to reach out to people so they could tell me not to kill myself, no one cared. People literally just didn't care if I killed myself. It's so fucking hilarious. People would probably fucking celebrate. They would all love it so much if I was dead I fucking know it. I see it every fucking time. 

Nothing matters to me. I prefer feeling nothing, because when I do feel something it's fucking crushing misery and I just wish I was dead. Why did I have to be this person. The worst fucking person I have ever met. Everyone else can just be happy, make friends, be normal. Why couldn't I have just been like that. Why did I have to be this way. I honestly don't know. 

What set me off is today I was supposed to work with a female partner in a class and she refused. This is after she refused to work with me all last semester. Apparently I am so gross she can't even stand to be with me for a few minutes. So I lie and tell the professor we are working together because I do not have the guts to ever stand up for myself because I'm a spineless cretin, as I fall behind. 

Tl;DR: I am probably one of the worst people around. I have no positive factors and I am actually downright terrible. I want to kill myself and just get it over with. The rest of my life is going to be like this. What is the point in being a piece of shit for 80 years when I could just speed up to the end now and get it all over with? There is so much more that I could say but this is getting long enough as it is. I could go into more details about just how shitty I am, but none of you care. None of you can say anything that could change who I am. "
"Something miraculous (or merely a coincidence) just happened, so I decide to stick around for a while.Earlier today I was filled with desperation and pretty determined that I must hang myself before midnight because all the worst things I can't handle comes to me all at once -- a big fight bwtween my toxic parents, mother's raging and screaming hurting my brain and nerves, drunk af father kept verbally abusing me all night, school sended a message that I'm about to get kicked out.
When I was searching on the youtube for the songs I'm going to listen to during hanging, I found that the MIT professor Gilbert Strang's newest course has just been uploaded about half an hour ago. I'm a big fan of him. Doesn't make me any less suicidal at all, but still feel like to finish all these lecture videos before death. So that's something what just happened."

"One day...Right now I'm somewhere in the midst of my third (that I can remember) period of suicidal ideation. I read and think about it a lot. I make mental plans of how and where, and if nothing else just hope that when the time does eventually come its as quick and easy as I can possibly make it. 
I have a husband and a daughter, two things that keep me rooted to my mortal coil. Not that I deserve them, nor do they deserve to be attached to a failure of a human such as myself. Life is a constant balancing act. Tired of living, but knowing what I would leave behind would damage the two people I love the most as much as I am damaged right now.
Life for me has never been on an upward trajectory. Every action usually comes with an equal, and often opposite reaction.
Have a baby? Great, prepare to find out 10 years later you've become naturally infertile.
Get married? Sure, just to spend the rest of my life mentally and financially draining my poor husband because my own career prospects are slim to none.
Get a job? Okay, but you gotta work menial jobs in the catering industry with a long term back problem for the rest of your life, because you were a horrendously mediocre student, didn't go to university, are thousands in debt because you don't earn enough to get by, therefore sponging off your husband and long suffering parents.
Every attempt to better myself or my situation has been met with a brick wall. The doctors dont care, my few friends all have their own lives going on so I don't want to inflict my misery on them. My parents are getting old now, they don't need me as a constant burden. My husband and daughter have a much better chance of making their lives better long term without me around dragging them down. I feel like a walking, talking appendix. Ultimately useless and not needed, my only functions are obsolete or undesirable. I often wish I would develop an aggressive illness and die swiftly, at least then I wouldn't leave behind any unanswered questions or loose ends."
"Rate/ Finnish by Edgar Allen Poe inspired poem for English class I had to write a poem about a parrot that's similar to ""The Raven"" by Edgar Allen Poe but idk how to finnish it. (I need 2 more stanzas with 4-6 lines each)

[Stanza 1]

Once upon a lofty journey, there was a pirate sick with scurvy.

He led a crew of the poorest goons, for they had lost their gold and all thier doubloons.

As the captain lay sleeping and slacking, he was awakened by creaking and cracking--

As his men entered his cabin, he assumed it was an attacker

Until he heard ""Polly wants a cracker.""

[Stanza 2]

He saw his prized parrot perched proudly upon his private's shoulder and promptly fed the bird.

Now that Polly had no hunger, the captain returned to his slumber and dreamt of something absurd.

He imagined an island full of treasure and riches for him and his crew to gather.

They filled their chests and britches and their pockets grew fatter and fatter.

To the captain's displeasure, he awoke once more, to the familiar sound of fluttering feather.

Then he heard, ""Polly wants a cracker.""

[Stanza 3]

He fed the bird again, hoping the interruptions would cease

But then Polly squawked ""Give me one more piece!""

The pirate gave into the bird's command, hoping they would quickly find land--

For they were low on food and night time was coming soon.

As the captain's eyes grew heavy and the sky became blacker 

Once again he heard, ""Polly wants a cracker."""
"Need Homework help? Come get free tutoring on twitch for the next hour so.  

Right off the bat, this is 100% completely free. I don't ask for donations and I don't want donations. I am so committed to this that I have promised to donate any money received to charity, and I'll post the receipt on the discord to prove it.

Now that's out of the way, Hi! I'm Arch, a college graduate waiting to get into medical school. In this next year I want to give back a little bit to the community and thought that tutoring could be a useful service to offer. My sister is a teacher, and she's told me that the pandemic has been really hard on a lot of students. That is why I am offering office-hours-style tutoring on twitch. I figure twitch is a good way for people to show up and ask questions without needing to sign up and lose their anonymity. I am a neuroscience major with a minor in astronomy. That means I have plenty of experience with the core three sciences and can (hopefully) help explain some of the more difficult concepts to you should you need some assistance.

Again, this is not for money or for karma or for clout. Show up for twenty minutes, ask a question, and leave without a second glance or follow or whatever. This is supposed to be a no pressure environment where students can get some additional help if they need it. Come and check it out if you want or send the link on to a friend if you know they are struggling with something in school. Absolutely no personal information is required. No names, no emails. Jump on twitch and ask a question in the chat, or follow the link to my discord in case you need to post a picture of a problem etc. There are no stupid questions. All I ask is that you be kind and courteous to anyone else in the stream and that you forgive me if I cannot answer your question.

(I am not going to do your homework for you. Just want to help with conceptual issues.)

The twitch is [twitch.tv/archexplains](https://twitch.tv/archexplains)

And you can find more information in my website [archexplains.org](https://archexplains.org/)

I want this to be a resource that anyone can use for a quick question or for in depth help. If you have any ways that I could improve the service please do not hesitate to let me know. Seriously, I just want to help, I know how frustrating these subjects can be when you feel like you need to teach them to yourself.

If you stumble across this later, my streaming schedule is on the twitch page so check in for the next time I will have office hours."

I had my first girlfriend (we split up because of covid restrictions and a lack of interest in not being able to see each other), I started college 4 weeks ago and I feel wanted on the world!

I didn't know what to expect when turning 17 besides being terrified of having my first driving lesson tonight.

But I just woke up and my mom (works full time so I can't see her until later) has left me a brand new phone next to me! I'm yet to open it because I wanted to make 1 last post with my old phone just to commemorate how much I've been through with this phone. I have 2 cracks from when I have had panic attacks and thrown it which I never replaced because they remind me of how I've improved. They have many pictures of my beautiful animals and times around the world. All in all I don't know how to feel! Excited with a brand new phone or a little sad I have to let this one go!"

"I'm scared.I've been having suicidal thoughts for about two and a half years now. It started out where I would just think about it occasionally, whenever my grades weren't to my satisfaction. Then I started thinking about it more often, and developed other habits, such as skipping meals or scratching myself with a key when I wasn't happy with myself. I would wonder if I would make it through college. 
Now, it's gotten worse, and I think about it more often, I've scratched myself a lot more, and I've spent hours thinking about the ideal way to kill myself. I've halfheartedly tried once, and come very close to trying another time. Now, for the past four nights or so, it's gotten really bad again, and I choked myself, just to see what it would feel like if I tried strangling myself. I'm back to thinking that I'm not going to survive college, and I'm so scared."

I cannot live like this anymore. I am the reason for my husband's misery and he's divorcing me. I am the reason behind my own misery. I have no where to go but a mattress in the living room of our 1 bedroom apartment.

I don't know how to fix my future. I spent the past 2 years in university (2nd year in B.H.Sc), and I was recently kicked out for failing classes repeatedly. I didn't do any work the entire first year, and by the time I tried to get serious in 2nd year, I was stuck in my old ways. Simply put, I didn't care for the classes or for the program. I'm also dangerously insecure &amp; anxious, to the point where boarding the bus, walking to class, and sitting through lectures takes an unbelievable amount of effort. So I skipped class alot. And thus I wasted $15K+ in tuition and other expenses (textbooks, bus pass, etc.) I wasted it. Knowingly. I knew I didn't care for the program, but I still went in thinking I could just go with the flow. I got through all of high school doing minimal work, and still landed honor's by graduation somehow. I thought I was smarter than average. I know now that I'm not only stupid, but arrogant, worthless, lazy, and entitled. I'm a waste of people's space, time, money, and energy. And it makes me want to die thinking that this is the sum of my existence. Everything has led up to this. I don't say any of this out of self-pity, rather I think I've come to a true understanding of my being. I've cut corners since grade school and I knew it would eventually come back to bite me. I did it anyway. I missed chance after chance to fix my act up, and it was only when I received the email telling me I was withdrawn from the program that I realized the extent of what I've done.


And the worst part is that I've been pretending to still be enrolled in school since February, when I was kicked out. I go to ""school"" (I basically just walk around malls and waste money on crap). I show my mom a forged transcript of B grades (some Cs for realism) and I'm at home pretending everything is fine. Imagining the moment everyone finds out makes me want to crawl into a hole and die off somewhere.The thought literally keeps me up at night and makes me cry convulsively. School is everything around here. Without it you're scraping for a living. $15k+ spent in tuition and other costs for 2 years that I threw away. I would quite literally rather die than face the consequences. I likely will. I'm just dragging this lie out for as long as I can. It's my lifeline. Since I don't see a future, I've been living accordingly. I buy random books, clothes, junk food, etc., wasting precious money and ruining my credit. I sit around the house all day and listen to music, watch videos, and eat food like everything is alright. I avoid my mom as much as humanly possible, because I don't want to be questioned or have to lie more than I need to. Living day to day is such a rollercoaster; when I succeed at forgetting all about my situation, it is like a paradise with no responsibilities. And at the height of it, darkness and despair sneak up on me and pull me down deeper than you can imagine. Most of the time, however, life is just an excruciatingly dull sense of perpetual idleness. Humans really aren't meant to be inactive, and I think it's making things a lot worse for my mental state (being locked in a room for days). But I can't go outside because 1. I'm way too insecure in the summer. 2. It feels wrong given my circumstances. I tried looking for local jobs to lessen the blow. Naturally, no one will take me; I have no experience or skills and I generally look like a shady and unfriendly person. And honestly, I don't want to work. The working world is just pure hell and nothing but suffering. I don't mind being productive, but the amount of crap that comes with it is unbearable. People are nasty &amp; rude. Everyone looks down on you for it. I don't want to be the McDonalds kid that everyone jokes about, the kid who couldn't make it. But I can't go back to school because I don't have the money and my GPA is through the floor now. I burned the bridge of life really effectively. 


What makes it infinitely worse is I have no one to confide in. My family is not the calm, supportive, understanding type. I'm very jealous of those types. My siblings are not good people to talk to. I hate them more than anyone else. One acts like I don't exist, the rest gossip and break my trust continuously and are generally just not intelligent people. They mock me and alienate me for very stupid reasons (e.g. I'm the youngest but also the tallest). My sister uses and bullies me everyday, and I can't complain or my mom gives me trouble for it. My sister speaks my mother's language better than me so she can manipulate my mom into taking her side. My mom is the only honest &amp; decent one in the family, but she is rash and simpleminded and doesn't understand me (english is not her first language). She just doesn't get complex emotions. She can't fathom the idea that her older children are not perfect and treat me badly. She works full time and is caring for my sick grandmother while in the middle of a lawsuit with my father, who has a lot of money but left the family years ago. My mom feels very strongly about proving to him that she can raise successful kids on her own. She always stresses to me that I need to do well in school to not shame her. And look what I did. I don't deserve a family after all, even if I don't like them much. 


I also don't have friends anymore. I ditched them and I can go on for days why. They were terrible friends; insecure, egocentric users who lack the capacity to talk about anything that isn't a joke. They feel threatened by me because I see through their shit, so they proceed to put me down constantly to stay on top. Everyone in my life acts this way toward me, like I am a threat to them. I generally feel like I'm the only person with any depth, though I know it's not true. Yet nobody takes me seriously, I am just around for entertainment. It made me happy to finally put my foot down. I thought that leaving them would also help me focus on my studies, and it did for a time. Until I stopped going to class entirely because I was too self-conscious to sit alone. I couldn't even listen to the professor in class if I thought that someone had glanced at me. Everytime I hear a group of people laugh together, I think maybe they're laughing at me. Sometimes I wish I hadn't left, because it is so crushingly lonely right now. And maybe I wouldn't have failed out. And even now they've already moved on with their lives and careers, with countless more friends to take my place. It hurts. It's nothing short of a nightmare. But even with all my reasons, I think me leaving my friends came down to the fact that I don't want anyone to know that I was failing.


So I've been venting online. And I've met some good people. But it just doesn't compare. No matter how many great people there are out there, they're just words on my screen from here. It doesn't compare. And all anyone can offer are quick-fixes or personal success stories. People just don't get it. I can't remember the last time (if ever) I fully expressed myself to anyone, without any reservations. And to have them understand me completely. It kills me inside to have so many thoughts and feelings that I want to share, with no one around. I know most people hated high school, but for me I was at least somebody with a place to belong. I was generally popular and had plenty of friends. But it wasn't necessary to have strong friendships, since you're surrounded by people all day. So when I moved on to university, I lost contact with all but two of them. And I realized those two were really bad friends, so like I said I cut them off. I don't know how to make new friends without a school or a job to go to. So for the past 2 years I've resorted to creating scenarios in my head obsessively. I spend countless hours imagining that I still have all my friends around, but that things are different. Whenever I watch or read something interesting, I pretend I have people to discuss it with. Sometimes it works, other times it comes crashing down. Sad, but it keeps me going. I wish more than anything that I could go back in time. It kills me inside to be stuck in the present. Can I just go back please? Either that or just end me now.


I don't know if I really want any advice. I don't think I do. I've gotten all the advice I could. People rebuilding their lives from scratch, and how failure is key to growth and success. ""Get a job and pay off the money"", ""Go into trade school"", ""Reapply in a program that you enjoy"". Or how I should just pack up and travel the country because I have nothing to lose. But I really don't care for any of that. I don't have it in me to start over. I don't know what my passion is and I'm not inclined to search for it while working some shit job. I do kind of like writing, and I think I'm alright at it. But there are too many obstacles and I'm already trailing behind everyone else. I really just want it all to end. Even the little things that used to bring me joy are starting to feel unwelcome. Like I shouldn't be allowed to have enjoyment after what I did. I should just stop wasting people's time and money. I feel incompetent at everything. I feel like I had my chance, and I don't want to start from rock bottom again. I can't see a future at all. When I hear about a new book or show coming out next year, I am aware that I won't be able to see it. There are many things I would like to do and see. But people make life way harder than it should be. Still, you can't experience the joy in life without putting in effort to survive. I don't have that effort in me. So I am a failure. And that is my life story. Hopefully I can say this is the end. "

"Deteriorating Health and No SupportI have heard amitriptyline is a good drug to overdose if I want to successfully commit suicide. Thankfully, I am prescribed this drug, so I will try to combine this with alcohol, Xanax, and any other downers I can find. 


I know that the aforementioned suicide method may not be successful, so I'm planning on buying some rope to hang myself after I have overdosed. I have thought about shooting myself and despite living in a state in the U.S. that permits gun ownership, I am not allow to own a gn because of mental health issues. 

For some background, my performance in school is declining, and I am past the drop date. Therefore, I will have three Fs on my transcript, and there isn't really a way to recover from that. Second, I have stupidly confessed my feelings to a co-worker, who is in a relationship, only to tell her I wanted space from her and nothing more. This has caused my coworkers to harass me at the workplace. 

I'm confident that I need to kill myself which I suppose sounds delusional. It would be better, especially for my coworkers and everyone I have injured in some way, that I be gone for good. I plan to commit suicide in the middle or beginning of April because that is when I can both, get a good supply of drugs to overdose on and the tools needed to hang myself.

I am a ridiculous person. I hurt people. I am hated. I am a piece of shit. I am stupid. There is nothing positive about my existence."
I dont think ill ever be happy again. Ever.I have absolutely no will to live anymore and I don't even know why I'm holding on still. Like I genuinely don't want to be here anymore and somehow I'm okay with it. I don't want to do life or anything like that. I'm sick of everything and everyone and how I sad I am about literally the dumbest shit. I have no will to continue and I think it's time to just end it. I've always wondered when I'd reach that point where I ACTUALLY didn't want to live anymore and I think I'm there. I don't want to exist pathetically anymore like I'm really tired of it. I've been waiting for things to get better since as long as I can remember and it never has. It's only gotten worse. Nothing means anything to me anymore. I'm actually really happy that I have no will to live anymore because now I can end it without hesitation. Anyways. I don't know why I'm posting here... Lol. Deuces âï¸

Is it weird if I peel a banana from the tip? I've always questioned the normality of how I eat it ever since my friend did it the opposite way. I've pretty much been doing it this way forever ( I always remove the brown tip when it's peeled) and this has been on my mind recently. If it's normal then is there universally any right way to peel a banana?
"Dissonance.When your behavior and actions are in direct contradiction with your personal code of ethics, despite every intention otherwise-- yet undeniably intentional at the same time. Cognitive dissonance: inexplicable and at its finest.

No, I'm not an addict. No, I'm not depressed. No, I'm not mentally unstable.

Although I am technically autistic. Asperger's Syndrome counts, I guess, and it's gotten me entirely too many free passes.

At 22 years old, I have attempted starvation once and running away twice. Each time I have been stopped or stopped myself, received psychological treatment, and was cleared shortly afterward with extremely positive remarks and letters from the psychiatrists vouching for me. 

I have never worked a day in my life, having been raised to focus exclusively on school.

I should have graduated college by now. It's the equivalent of Ivy League for art schools, unforgivingly expensive and only possible for me with multiple scholarships and 2 loan cosigners-- my father and retired grandmother. If anything happens to me or I fail, they foot the bill on my massive student debt after having already gone through hell and back to pay as much for me as possible.

My past 3 incidents have all been in the wake of academic crisis, not putting in the work for enormous projects, panicking, still avoiding the work with ""I'll get around to it in a minute"". Minutes go by, then hours, then days, weeks. Deadlines pass, I'm given accommodations to turn assignments in late, and I bail. Over and over. I can't recall the last academic quarter where I did not have some crisis towards the end where I either dropped the course or had professors bend over backwards to let me pass.

Yet time and again, the administration extends the grace to me to allow me to continue another quarter with these accommodations 

My chosen career path is notorious for strict, grueling, hard deadlines. I have proven time and again that I am not fit for this industry. If the only times I can succeed are through bending the rules in my favor, then I would be an unviable hire; this industry is also intensely competitive to begin with.

And yet, somehow, that cold reality doesn't light a fire in me to rise up to the challenge. If I don't have the willpower, then I certainly don't deserve the inordinate amount of help I've been receiving.

This quarter would be different, I was certain. Except I lacked the determination I told myself I had, and fell into apathy as the quarter progressed. It's not time mismanagement, it's not an unreasonable workload, it's anxiety converted into laziness.

This quarter was my final chance. I fail this time, I'm out for good. As it should be. But now deadlines were yesterday, I'm skipping class to work on them without having even started in the hopes that the professors will accept them late, and still not starting. 

If (when) I fail again, I'll drop out for good. I have nothing else to fall back on, I'll be stuck bumming out on my parents and working at Publix trying to help them make a dent in my student loans.

I'm also a closet gay, and they're conservative bible belt Christians. After I accepted it, I had planned after graduation to move to a faraway city where I could finally enter the dating scene without them ever having to find out, as it would *break* them nearly as badly as if I had actually killed myself.

So I'll have to deal with that, on top of the **crushing shame** of failing college after everyone in my family and the school's administration gave arms and legs to pave my way to success. After having built up all my life as being ""the smart one"", voted in high school for ""most likely to succeed"", ""bright"", ""gifted"", I'm spitting in the face of everyone who ever believed in me-- which has been literally everyone in my life, not a single soul has ever doubted me as far as I can remember. What an incredibly rare privilege for someone who wasn't born into money, something so many people would kill for, and I've squandered it.

And the cherry on top is, of course, the couple hundred thousand dollars in student debt I've racked up which will ensure that I am stuck at home mooching off my parents indefinitely. I have no marketable skills other than my art, which is subpar and I am otherwise unfit for the industry.

I can't live like that. I can't face that reality, I deserve all of it and more but I can't face my retribution.

I've seen firsthand already, 3 separate times, how my family would be devastated in the event of my suicide. If I would be willing to trade that for my escape from my justice, after witnessing it myself 3 times, then what I really deserve is for them disown and toss me out on the streets to slowly and painfully succumb to the elements and hunger and thirst.

But they love me too much. More than I deserve, too much for their own good.

But if I'm gone, then they're stuck with all of the debt.

But if I stay, then I'll live only to desire an end to it all.

I don't know what to do.

I'm sitting in front of my work right now, 4.5 hours before my next class where I can face one of my professors with the work from a project I've still yet to start and the deadline was Monday.

I want nothing more than to drown myself in sleeping pills, or drink a cocktail of my cleaning supplies. The only thing keeping me from rushing out of my seat in a panic lately during classes is ignoring the lectures to focus on these images, over and over. It's practically become a form of meditation to keep myself calm, in spite of the sheer irrationality.

However, I know how resilient the human body is in regards to chemicals, of how much pain there would be waiting for the final moments. There is no such thing as a perfect suicide, as all the conceivable methods are either slow and unreliable or painful and unreliable. Even bullets, buildings, and blades have their survivors and unexpectedly drawn out deaths. Electrocution, as well.

I know all this, but it doesn't help. Typing this all out has been cathartic, but it accomplishes nothing. 4 hours left to work, there's too much for me to possibly finish in time for this unofficial 2nd deadline I've given myself.

I'm drowning in a glass of water, which I've poured myself. All I have to do is stand up, but instead I lie down.

I don't deserve help. But what do I do?

Except I know what to do, but I don't?

Cognitive dissonance is a powerful thing."
"Obligatory life sentenceI feel like Iâm forced to exist. Iâm forced to have constant anxiety and depression that medication doesnât fix all because my parents couldnât wear a fucking condom.

It seems to get worse every day I just don't want to live anymore I will never get my life together and with every day it gets worse. I haven't done much in my life and never will I always put his wants and needs before mine helped him pay off his debt and fulfill his dreams.

I was such a happy person a few years ago made everyone laugh and enjoyed it so much to brighten up someone's day. I had so many plans. I've never felt like this. Lately when I'm taking the subway I just want to take big step and jump to stop this pain, this everlasting agony already. I find myself on google all night trying to figure out how I can make taking my own life look like an accident(to make it easier for my family) and wondering why I can't just fall asleep and never wake up.

Nothing is right. Nothing feels right and I can't do anything right. My family hates me, my SO hates me, I have no friends, I feel helplessly alone. I have no one to talk to and every time I open my god damn mouth I fuck up somehow. I can't sleep at night anymore. Everything feels empty and useless and....fuck. Even writing this feels useless.

I only have two friends left, and both of them are slipping away. One has cancelled every plan we've made for the past two months and only calls me to borrow my Hulu Plus account.

The other, my boyfriend of five years and best friend of the past 8 years ... is on the verge of leaving me. He is long distance, a few hours away, and we were planning to move in together. But now he wants to stay there and move in with his friends. He says I can't join them there. That's probably for the best, I'd never be able to find a job as good as I have here, but very soon my job will be all I have left, and even that is only ""okay."" I still live paycheck-to-paycheck.

I just don't know what to do. The boyfriend says we will still be friends if he makes the decision to stay there, but honestly I don't see how that's possible given the circumstances. As selfish as it is, I couldn't stand to see him happy without me. I'd die if I had to watch him move on.

I don't have summer classes, and even if I did I take online courses because of work. I don't have a car so I can't drive to the local hobby shop (tabletop gaming) where I might *actually* meet some cool people. And when I *am* around people I feel like I'm constantly on the precipice of a panic attack. I hate meeting new people, but I want to so badly.

I am fucking hopeless.

I just got insurance through my job, so I made an appointment to speak with a doctor about anti-depressants, but I couldn't get an appointment until September. I'm scared I won't make it.

Sorry for the wall of text. I just really needed to rant, even if only to strangers. Thanks for listening."
"I donât have anyone to talk to anymoreMy boyfriend said I was being too negative, and I donât want to be annoying. I have no friends, they are all fair weather. Work is pushing me to my breaking point, and I am never going to amount to anything. I want to end it so badly, but the funeral costs would be too much for my family. They probably couldnât afford someone to clean up after me either. I hope it will get better, because it is so hard to be alone."
"Anyone here involved with Teen PEP at their high school? Anyone here involved with Teen PEP at their school?

My school has a teen PEP (prevention education program) that accepts juniors and seniors, but it is fairly selective and requires an application and interview for acceptance into the program.

I really like everything about the program and feel itâs a great opportunity and fit for me. So, I wondering if anyone here could give me some guidance on how the whole application/interview process goes, and just your overall thoughts and experience with the program?

Not sure how many people here have heard of it or will even see this, but any help or advice would be much appreciated. Thanks!"
"in addition to my last post about the cd. in addition to my last post about the cd, I played the cd and found some extremely disturbing material that I cant show for reasons I think you can guess. I found pictures of cheese pizza. im going to go find my registration, or whatever tells me who I bought it from. I have a new phone and everything, so I dont have their contact anymore. when I took the cd out of the player it was all scatched so i took it out and blew on it and rubbed it to try and clean it, so if there were any fingerprints on it, theyre gone now. i dont want to get myself in trouble by reporting it. what if the guy doesnt have cheese pizza anymore, and im left with the cd. i think im just going to break it, or burn it, anyhting to get rid of it."
"Bought a gun two days agoThey stopped processing permits in my state temporarily so I bought a hunting bolt-action rifle. It takes ten rounds. I keep it next to my bed with the magazine loaded and next to it. I just keep looking at it over and over and over again when Iâm home from work.

I bought it to kill myself. I took care of my will. Figured out everything thatâs gonna happen when I die. Knowing itâs ready to go has given me so much peace and my friends have commented that I seem so much happier the past couple of days. I wish I could tell them itâs because itâs finally going to be over for me and for everyone I was a burden on. Theyâll be without me and it might hurt at first but then their lives will be so much better.

I just wanted to share somewhere they wouldnât see it. I donât want them to stop me. Tomorrow night Iâm going to drink, call emergency services so that they can get my body right away so nobody has to see me that I love, and take care of it. I feel so free."

"Iâve been playing beast and the harlot on clone hero, but now just payed attention to the lyrics. Jesus Christ âThere sat a seven-headed beast
Ten horns raised from his head
Symbolic woman sits on his throne
But hatred strips her and leaves her naked


The beast and the harlot


She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the greatâ

"Well, this is it.This is my final open letter to everyone reading this. I'm currently 18, have multiple medical conditions that cannot be fixed, have ass grades, no friends, family has turned against me and my girlfriend of 3 years cheated on me last night. I've decided today is the final fix to it all. Best wishes to everyone and take care.

Kindest Regards,

"Can't stop thinking about itI have a couple of specific methods in mind. I'd say there's a 20% chance I'll go through with it tonight. I just can't handle the idea of my boyfriend finding my body. He loves Christmas. I don't want to ruin it for him. But I cannot stop thinking about suicide. I've stopped making plans with people, stopped caring for myself, stopped... pretty much everything because I'm only going to kill myself anyway.

We've discussed the idea of me moving out for a week or so because I am difficult to be around at the moment. I am a burden. I am a terrible partner. I don't want to go on any more."
"I'm an amputee and don't see the point of this anymoreI was told they had to amputate my toe yesterday because of a bone infection. When I woke up from surgery I was told that they had found more infection in the foot and had to remove my big toe the knuckle behind it and the bone that ran from my knuckle to my ankle. I am having an extremely hard time accepting it and seeing any kind of food outcome that my life can have after this was done. I feel worthless, I have to re learn how to walk and get around again and learn how to manage the pain. With the amount of pain and the treatment that I have received in the hospital and will probably receive the entire time I'm here I dont see a point in carrying on (here is a list of what has happened while in the hospital 
Natalie 3rd floor act as if she was going to assault me ( felt physical threat, rude and condescending)
Ashley 5th floor act as if she was going to assault me ( felt physical threat, rude and condescending)
Jaclyn 5th floor charge nurse (rude and condescending threatened me)
Francis 5th floor (condescending attitude)
Katia charge nurse 3800 floor ( rude and rolled her eyes twice while talking about complaints, condescending attitude)
Have been laying here naked since 4 pm yesterday( no gown offered. Until I complained to x ray teck)
When admitted to fifth floor room had no top sheet, no blanket, no towels, no toilet paper, no essentials (deodorant, toothpaste or toothbrush, mouth wash, or tub that contains all of that) 
No iv pole in room was stuck to bed pressed call button to use restroom and no one showed up and almost pissed myself ( I waited 20 mins to the point I couldn't wait anymore and had to piss in sink because I couldn't physically get to the toilet. On top of all this I feel like I will only be a burden on my family and dont see a point in living any longer. I'm at my wits end and believe that I will try and end it once I am released from here."
"I donât deserve to liveI feel like my friends and family would be better off without me. I just bother everyone, Iâm a failure, Iâm completely alone, no one cares about me. Iâm so negative and mean I just donât deserve to be here, if I wasnât here everyone would be happier "
"Fuck my lifeGrad school looks like a bleaker and bleaker prospect, the first girl I've dated in the year since I've moved out here just decided to go back to her long distance boyfriend, friends cancelled on me for this weekend, another girl who was interested in a date starting talking about marriage and the date isn't until Saturday.  New Jersey is a cesspool and I hate my job and my life.  I see no reason to continue.  My friend reminds me there are people that love me, I told her I don't see the point when they are 1000 miles away and I would see them for maybe a week out of the year at most.  My friends in New York aren't real friends.  They are acquaintances.  Not enough coping mechanism to deal with the pain.  Decided not to drink any alcohol because I don't have enough to kill myself.

I see no winning scenario.  I was finally building some semblance of a life, happiness, and possible career move.  At some point you get tired of seeing it all knocked down, the best years of your life carelessly float away on all of the broken plans you've made.  At some point the only winning move is not to play.  And we all get there at some point any way.

Really, I just kind of want to be done with life.  It wasn't what I thought it was.  So far from it.  And it seemed to hold so much promise.  We were all lied to.  You become a slave to a corporation or you watch yourself give away building any semblance of a career or if you want to go alternative you're blocked at every path and the gatekeepers don't let you in.  I have enough debt this is a moot point anyway.

What I really want to do is start over.  I've fucked up so much.  I just want to be someone else.  The person who I thought I should be.  All I wanted to do was be an engineer and make cool inventions and just help people.  Not to be stuck in a lifeless office full of miserable New Jersey scum that hate their lives.  I am stuck in a toxic hell, corrupted by it, absorbed by it.  I am a part of it now.  I am one with the bullshit, part of the grey twilight.

I've never had drug problems.  I had a minor alcohol problem I kicked last year.  I've never had LGBT problems; I identify as straight but I've never been hostile towards my bi-curious feelings.  I come from a relatively middle class family of a blue collar worker who makes good money.  I have no logical reason to be upset.  My job pays ok but I have debt.  Mostly I'm a disappointed optimist turned cynic turned confused 25 year old who has realized there is no end to the tunnel.  There is no escape, no great victory. There is only the slow monotonous march towards the end.  I have no great gift for the world as I believed.  I am nothing special.

All I wanted to do was help the world.  All I wanted to do was leave it a better place than I found it.  And I can't even do that.

I'm 1000 miles from people who care about me.  I owe too much, I can't turn back.  I don't know who I am.  I don't know who I want to be.  I just want to go back to who I used to be, someone who thought they could make a difference in the world before seeing how little most people care.  Self-destructive animals.

Maybe I'm not suicidal.  Maybe I'm just really disappointed.  At the world.  At myself...

Well it's time to go to bed.  I have to go get some sleep so I can work my job I hate in 6 hours, to pay for my car and apartment so I can keep going to my job that I hate... while using the remaining money to pay off my student debt.  And I'm an engineer.  How the fuck the rest of you deal with this is beyond me.  Maybe with friends.

Just the act of typing this out, of crying has been therapeutic.  I still feel alone.  But the weight has been lifted.  The crushing feeling has passed.  And now I can begin to figure my way out of the situation I've dug for myself.  I can breathe again.  The anger has settled.  The calm is here.

"I don't understand why!All I've ever wanted was to be loved. I thought I had that for awhile, marriage, two beautiful children for whom I would do it all over again. After 18 years I could no longer pretend that everything was jolly. My husband worked away from home a lot and used that time to act as if he were still single. The kids and I were more of an inconvenience for him than anything. After being out of that relationship for a year I thought I was ready for another. I was lonely and had doubts that anyone would want to change that. When a man came along, online, and told me everything I wanted to here I hung on for fear I may never find anyone else to want me. That was a short lived relationship but long enough to drive a wedge between my children and myself. I will never forgive myself for that. Since then I have realised that I am quite capable and don't need a man in order to survive. My children have come back to me but I can't help thinking there is a scar that will never heal between us. I have had some interaction as far as relationships go however, they have never lasted. One fellow who had been visiting for a few months/year, told me I was an amazing, beautiful woman that he wished he'd met twenty years earlier, then he just faded away. That's what they seem to do, fade away never to be seen again. I am not a demanding woman, I'm easy going. I don't like to argue but I do have strong beliefs and opinions which I can defend, but I don't expect a man to think the same as I do about everything. If you're attracting the wrong type change what you're doing right? I have never pretended to be someone I'm not just to hold attention. I am me, honest, good communicator, I have a sense of humour and can see the positive in most things and people. Yet here I sit, alone. I can tell myself what a wonderful person I am and that if I like myself first others will also. It doesn't happen. Right now I feel like I'm old, overweight, ugly and not wanted by anyone. That's a damn lonely place to live. 
I've suffered with depression for many years and have been getting help with that. I am able to keep on a smoother path, only the occasional pothole which doesn't turn into a bottomless pit anymore, but I never seem to be able to climb up to see over the horizon either. I tend to self sabotage when I do go to the doctor, I have never wanted to be one to complain or give the poor me vibe, so I down play how I do feel most of the time. 
Is there any hope of me getting myself out of this rut? I tell myself once this crisis is over thing will be better but there is always another crisis! Is a struggle to get out of bed most days because I can't see where things are getting better so why even bother. What's the point? My kids could do just fine without me, in fact they take care of me more than the other way around and that makes me feel like a burden. No, I haven't felt suicidal for many years but I don't understand why everything has to take so much effort. I have to fight for everything. Nothing ever comes easy or simple. Why? Why me?"

"I don't wanna live, but i don't want to kill myselfI can't remember the last time I went a day without considering suicide. About two months ago, i biked to the highest bridge near where I live, but physically didn't have the will to jump.

This is how it's been for about the past two years; I hate myself and want death, but I don't have the will to kill myself. Honestly, if tomorrow I get diagnosed with cancer, i'll be happy. Instead of acting on my suicidal thoughts, I just spend every day drowning in my lack of motivation. My grades have fallen dramatically (I used to be a 4.0 student, now there's three classes that I'm nearly failing), and as a result my parents have entirely lost faith in my future (as have I). My closest friends can't help me, quite a few of them are considering suicide themselves.

does anyone have any advice on how i can get the motivation to actually live?"
"Can I post here without being institutionalized again?Last time I posted here (over 2 years ago) someone called the admins or something and the police came to my house and institutionalized me for a week, just cause I admitted to wanting to die. How am I supposed to talk freely if I'm afraid of being committed again? Is that still a thing people do here? Because it doesn't help."

"Anyone else kinda know exactly what they need to do to turn their life around but just 'cannot' bring themselves to do it?Theres always an excuse ""im too tired"" (which ive only recently realised is due to depression) or 'I need to work' so i wont have time. Or I tell myself I wont enjoy something so why even try. 

When I think of what effort I need to put into ""getting better"" i just feel like fuckit, I'd rather just kill myself than live in my current state of mind. I end up 'researching' methods every night before bed. Overdose or Hanging is not viable for me. Been searching for suicide bridges and the one in my country(ive considered the 7 hour drive it would take to get there) has only recently been barricaded with a 26ft iron fence the entire length of the bridge.

I know what I need to do to get better but im just soo...tired"
"You have forgotten meThe world has abandoned the closeted gay man. The one who is hurting, the one who has no family, no friends who can really empathize. You all watched our marriages become legalized, you invited yourself to Pride parades and watched Modern Family because of your ""progressivism."" You have not saved a space for me or people like me in your hearts. You have believed the lie that everything is remedied. You refuse to look at my scars or, if you do, you do so nonchalantly. I want to die because I must not belong here in this timeline where the rest of you are happy and where my problems, my iniquities, and my shortcomings were created by my own hand.

i told a kid to pull his mask up and he coughed all over me (sorry for bad grammar i dont care right now) god i hate my school so much it's just a bunch of homophobes and stupid antimaskers. most of them think the masks don't even do anything and they just walk around with their masks down breathing out their nasty germs all over everybody. i want to change schools so bad and move. i live in the a super conservative place and as a lgbt teen living here it sucks so bad and i hate it here. fgydudnfgryufngrjehgw i mean i do know a few supportive people here but it's hard to be in contact with them because none of my friends KNOW HOW TO TEXT I MEAN IS IT SO HARD TO REPLY AT ALLLL I SWEAR. anyways i just had to rant somewhere because nobody i know talks to me so there.
I got visited by a reddit care bot lol Someone was so concerned about me they ratted me out to a care bot. Thats funny. More of an annoyance type of funny. So yeah. I honestly didn't know reddit had one of those. 7 months and I'm still learning things. Who knew.

It costs more to buy one of every award on reddit with different currency To buy every award it costs 86490 coins. I live in Ireland so I worked out to buy the minimum required coins it would cost â¬241.97 ($285.04) but I did the math using the American prices and it costs $219.97 (â¬186.73) which is significantly differentboriginal price I got for just being a different currency. It costs more to buy coins with euro than US dollars even though a dollar is worth 0.85 euro.(I made this post before just I accidentally used subreddit specific awards)

Why are people on this sub so sexist??? Like bro itâs actually so annoying can someone tell me why so I can try and make it stop or something????
I donât know how parents do it!? I was just doing âthe usualâ tonight like any other night and my mum walked in to my room because I forgot to shut my door. Iâm not sure if she saw anything but she acted like nothing happened and asked for a hug and a kiss. I am confused and scared.
"I know this is late but. I know this is long. I also know this might catch some shit. But in 2018, about mid-November, my crush noticed me and we started hanging out. (Why am I telling you this after two years? Because Iâve only been on reddit for a couple of months) We had fun, kissed, held hands, but after school ended (July 2019), she texted (Iâm not exactly sure what she said) but she said something about it not working because she wanted it to be less public. (I had been quite socially awkward since coming to the school and Iâd figured if I was public about the relationship, it wouldnât let people make fun of me for it) But then, after a few days, I remembered how sheâd basically told everybody about it on TikTok. So I tried texting her about that, but apparently she was racing cars and so she left her phone with her friend. She told me another two excuses for her breaking up with me: I was weak and awkward. Now, I wonât pretend I wasnât both of those (I am no longer weak or awkward) but sheâd never seemed to care. After the exchange, Grace (if you are her, scrolling thru new, you know itâs you and so â­â©â®(à² \_à² )â­â©â®) sent me a message along the lines of âif you try to be her boyfriend, I will fucking kill youâ and so I just shut up for a few months. In december, last year, I called her. We chatted, I told her about my new school, and we were presumed âfriendsâ. Anyway, a few weeks later, I had to know the real reason she broke up. To which she replied: (I will never forget these words.)

âI only was your bf for one reason.â

âWell, actually two.â

âOne: I felt bad for youâ

âTwo: I wanted to see what having a bf was likeâ

Anyway, since then Iâve been super lonely. And being at an all-boys school, I knew I wasnât finding someone who cared about me for me anytime soon. Or so I thought. In mid-July, I was at a friendâs house and he was asleep and I couldnât sleep. So I pick up my iPad and see whatâs going on on this sub. I see lots of posts from people who are bored and want to chat, and I decide to do the same. Five people messaged me. Iâm only messaging one right now. But she is amazing, cares about me, and even pulled an all-nighter with me a few nights ago. Again, youâll know who you are. Honestly, this might be a stretch, but she probably saved me from getting slight depression because my friends would only laugh if I told them the truth."

Now though, all the consequences seem to be catching up and I really donât feel thereâs an alternative than to do it. Iâm scarred of it but Iâm just as terrified of not doing it. Itâs like Iâm trapped."
"I wish I shot myself a year ago. I can't get my hands on a gun anymore.Where I'm from, it's impossible to get a gun. We go through military service and I had a window where I could have gotten access to a lethal rifle and not some pansy pistol that I'm pretty sure could leave a brilliant spray of pink on the ceiling. 

I don't want to jump off a building. What if I don't split my skull open and bleed out, but just break a few bones instead? What if I just end up being paralyzed? who'll throw me off their balcony for me? 

The brightest idea I have now is to get blood thinners and bleed out. I'll even donate blood before hand so I'll need less to bleed out on! Even this isn't fool proof. That's why I wish I ended it all a year ago."

I am going to high school who else am going to a new school and i know no one and am trying to to find other people who are in the same situation so we could help each other during this hard time 14M btw will be 15 in a few months
"Anywhere I can find information on ways to kill myself?I sincerely doubt that this is the place to be asking this, I might off-handedly find someone whos in the know, so help a brother out.

I don't have access and cant get access to a gun, and hanging myself seems like too much suffering.

I was thinking a guillotine, which is probably the way I'm going to go about it, but I'm wondering if there are any other ways which are;

1) Quick.
2) The most effective.
3) Have the lowest failure rate.

Any help appreciated."

"Just hate being myselfCurrently at home. Drunk. Iâve wanted to kill myself since I was around maybe 15 years old. Iâm 21 now. The thoughts seem to come in waves.
I have tried exercising, eating healthy, seeing a doctor and being more social. 
None of it works and I keep coming back to wanting to die. 
The worst part is that I feel like all this could be fixed by getting into a relationship. I know this will only
Make things worse but Iâm so lonely I crave any attention I can get. 
I wish I could be exceedingly happy like other people I see but it is almost exhausting for me.

I feel sick. 
I was deported for overstaying my visa, he is in Florida and I am in the UK. We planned on bring him here. 
Since I was deported he stopped taking care of himself and has drank himself to death. 
All of his organs are failing and he has a couple days left to live. I can't even be by his side, I can't even kiss him goodbye. I can't even attend his funeral. 

I am thinking of taking my life to be with him. He is my world. It has now been ripped from me.

"Suicidal Gender Dysphoric whines, part IITwo weeks ago I wrote a post here revealing two important secrets that I had been keeping for my entire life--That I'm a transgender person, and that I want to die.

A few days later, I tried to kill myself. I failed.

Today, I have just finished dismantling my suicide kit.

In my original post, the central thing that I wanted to whine about was not that I had been born in the wrong skin, or even that I wanted to die; it was the situation I found myself in a month ago, which so perfectly fits the analogy of circling a drain. I had a plan, but only one day a week in which I could do it. On that night, every seven days, it was the same question. It was inevitable that one of those times the answer would be yes. 

But I made a mistake. It was a really stupid one, very simple. I put a handcuff on my wrist backward. There is no reason to go into why that was important. Just know that what it meant was that I would live, unharmed, and without anyone discovering my secret.

A few years ago, contemplating suicide, I wrote that the only way to really have a proven suicidal person would be for that person to survive an attempt despite a genuine desire to die. At the time, it seemed almost impossible to do for me, because I couldn't imagine me failing. But yeah, I fucked up anyway. Ego deflated. But at the same time, I think I've made my point.

Even though I was still alive, I had not escaped the seven day cycle. For the longest time I couldn't see a way out of it. But this morning I found a way out, I guess a loophole. Instead of seven days time, I should wait much longer.

It was hard to admit that there are things in life that I would like to do, but there are. For example, I... really want to see the new star wars.

In addition there are many, many other people who are born with crushing weight on their backs, about which they can do nothing. Do all of them commit suicide? There are people born without arms and legs, or without eyes. Clearly, they found ways to go on, ways to cope. That is what I am proposing to do for myself.

Now instead of waiting seven days for that window, I am going to wait seven months. To put off the question of life or death until December. Until then, there has to be something I can do. If I can't fix my condition, maybe I can at least make life tolerable, or more comfortable.

We're done here. But most of the weapons of my demise are in a dumpster right now, and I had to tell someone. Going to go cry now."

"I'm retiring. From life and everything that lies therin.Hi.

I think I have lived too long. I have lost my every family member. I have likely killed or partook in the killing of many families now. I have accepted medals for senseless violence while my own homeland was wracked with grief. I hate myself now. My daughter can no longer give me a calming voice. She rests somewhere in the void. It will benefit the future of humanity if I no longer exist. I don't know how I will do it, exactly, but I have to try."
"It's about time I go. I'm far too soft and people are too much for me.Continuing from this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1g1f6c/im_far_too_soft_for_this_world/

I've been considering suicide for some time now. I never knew how I'd do it but I think if anything I'd OD on my anxiety medication and drink myself to sleep. This world is far to bleak and my life is not going anywhere. I have no job, I'm 24 and I don't like the state of this world. I try my best to be kind to people but people use me as their personal punching bag. 

I have ""friends"" that I've had hearts to hearts with whom I told I have a brain tumor. Today, because the universe had the planets perfectly aligned to make me just want to end it, two people who don't even know each other both made fun of the fact that I have this tumor. It isn't something I find funny, and it's something that causes me intense amounts of anxiety. One of them was annoyed because he did bad in League of Legends (a videogame). He was telling another friend of ours that he didn't want to be criticized for doing badly so I made a harmless joke that didn't have anything to do with the game, or anything serious at all. His response: ""And you have a brain tumor. So, you know...""

Then not even an hour after, another friend texted me. He, like me, has anxiety but his is far less controlled. He's also a very paranoid person in general but I would sit down and talk with him when he was depressed. I was completely empathetic. For whatever reason he thought I was mad at him and we needed to talk. I told him we would later but I was busy at the moment (I was, plus I wasn't in a good mood from the earlier insensitive comment). I put down my phone and returned to messages saying, ""You have a brain tumor and I don't, I see now why your bitch left you""(referring to my ex girlfriend who he knows I love and am still getting over) and he called me a ""crackhead"" because I am taking anti-anxiety. 

Honestly, if me having a brain tumor is a way for people to insult me when I've been nothing but kind to them, this is not a world worth living in. I want a painless death to leave this place for good."
I'm a girl so anyone want to talk? Anyone want to talk about anything?

"I wanna say I do have it bad but I wanna know if Iâm âentitledâ in a sense Iâve been struggling for the past 3 years debating whether or not I actually have it bad, when I first had the worst thing in my life happen to me being the NWMS school shooting and NHS bomb threat my life started going down hill. Iâve had constant arguments with family and recently my parents got divorced and Iâve been left with the my mom who constantly complains about everything and yells at me and my other sibling. And then I look on the fact that she supplies me a bed and home and sometimes food but sheâs absent on everything else in my life. She yells at me and just verbally assaults me and my sister when we do something remotely wrong and on top of that sometimes our grandma has to buy us food because my mom doesnât go to the grocery. So I wanted to ask all of you if Iâm really entitled or Iâm batshit crazy even giving my life the benefit of the doubt and saying Iâm entitled"
"Don't want to get betterHad depression for a few years and I was trying to get better. But now I don't feel like trying or even that I want to. Friends and family are supportive and have good advice. Paying for therapy, listening to me when I have a bad episode. But recently I have realised that I am not actually doing anything to help myself get better. It's more like I am simply paying lip service to myself and others to convince myself/them that I am going to put in effort. I attended therapy a few times but I didn't really try. Spoke about my low self esteem but when she tried to convince me that I shouldn't have low self worth it doesn't ring true for me. It's the same when other people try. I have people that care about me and want me to feel better about myself but I just can't take it on board.

I think that now I don't even want to feel better. It's become normal now and I'm more comfortable that way. It's easier than trying and I'm not convinced I deserve to feel good anyway with the way I treat others and the selfish thoughts I often have.

I don't want to kill myself because I can't be bothered to. But hopefully I'll die sometime soon. I know a lot of suicidal people say that they don't kill themselves because their family would be heartbroken. But I barely even think about that and I'm not sure I care. I think I'm just a bad and selfish person. "
"I am so fat and greedy For the last THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS I have went on THREE CALORIE SURPLUSES. Iâve ate 2000 calories. You might think that 2000 calories is âtheâ standard amount but for me it will cause weight gain. Judging from how fat my family is and how much puppy fat I got during puberty, I have a slow metabolism and it is very easy for me to gain weight. I have to stick to 1,600 calories a day, even with plenty of exercise. I made a huge mistake today. I was confident and thinking that I ate 1,650, but when I added the calories in all of the five apples I snacked on THATS TWO THOUSAND THATS TOO MUCH I AM SO FUCKINGG FAT BEING SKINNY IS PART OF WHO I AM.
Itâs not just my obsession witb being skinny. If itâs not weight, itâs some other insecurity and source of low self-esteem. If I was fat I could write a long long list of why I love myself but still hate myself to shreds because I would be fat. Being skinny is the foundation of all my identity and self-esteem."
"Help me help my friend.Please help.

I have a friend. Well he isn't really a friend. But I care enough about him. He is around 16 years old now. He used to go to my school but left because of reasons. He hasn't been in education for around a year (I think) and I always knew he wasn't mentally healthy. He was a bit of an outcast. Sorry if I'm typing this fast but I need to help him.

I hadn't spoken to him in years up until a few months ago as my other friend who contacted him occasionally said that he was really suicidal. I think I managed to talk him out of it via steam chat and then I added him on skype. I recently checked my skype and saw that he changed his status to ""Done with myself.""

Help me. wtf can I do.

I don't talk to him often, he has no friends either. He's depressed.

please help."

"I just fought in roblox and the guy i fought got salty basically long story short, this kid called me a furry and I called him a smutt writer because he was saying weird stuff about me and a friend on the internet and got into an arguement which caused us to end of dueling in a game called vertigo on roblox to settle wether or not I was a furry or he was a smutt writer and when i won he called a rematch saying i miscounted and the judge guy that was watching us said to do a rematch because he was pretty sure I won but wasn't too sure so we did a rematch and I won again and he got annoyed and kicked me from our discord group alongside the judge guy, atleast i'm not a furry."
"i need relationship advice  \*for some context before i begin i should mention that my mom just gave birth to my beautiful babysitter that just turned 1 month old. she has no immune system. because of the pregnancy being at the same time as the pandemic quarantine has been so so hard on us. i haven't seen him in 6 months. and because my mom has ocd she won't even let me go in our backyard. i haven't left my neighborhood in 6 months. it's been incredibly hard.\*

last night we were on the phone after not getting to talk much that day. i start asking him about his day and out of nowhere he just starts going off about how corona is ''just the flu'' and that if my sister got it that it wouldn't be that big of a deal... even if my sister got a fever because of how weak her immune system they would have to do a spinal tap on her. for those of you who don't know what a spinal tap is thats where they stick a big needle all the way through your skin and into your spine. it is extremely painful and traumatic for even adults. 

this pandemic has taken 6 months of my life that i can never get back. but the only thing that is keeping me going is knowing that me sacrificing my mental health and isolating for 6 months is at least protecting my sister. and he really has the nerve to say that i am doing all of this for nothing. he kept yelling at me that i ''don't understand the human immune system''. he REALLY has the nerve to say that when he can't even spell some 4 letter words and he learned anatomy from an anime.... 

he even makes his mom call my mom every time they go out to try to ''convince her'' to let me go out with them. my family is doing exactly what the doctors told us to do and they can't respect that in the slightest. 

his family gave up on quarantine after 1 month. he goes wherever he wants and sees whoever he wants. and he rubs his freedom in my face. he has asthma so he still has a big risk for the virus but he doesn't care. he doesn't care who he would infect if he gets it. when i bring this up to him he just says ''yeah i like to live on the edge'' and laughs. ITS NOT A JOKE   

i have been nothing but kind to him. i watch him streaming video games for hours even though i hate it. i always give him what he wants. i always ask him about his day. i do what he wants me to. i show him my body even if i don't want to. i stay in the call with him even when he's literally ignoring me. i try everyday to be the best i can be for him. and he just picks me apart

even if he is right and it has no risk. i cannot control whether i leave my house or not. my parents do. bringing up this ''covid is not that bad'' crap is not going to help me in the slightest. it just made me feel even worse. why would you do that to someone you love?"

"i figure someone here might relate. i guess i want someone to know how i feelI feel like I am valueless
So ignorant and stupid 
So incredibly pathetic
So useless, such wasted potential
If I ever had any potential at all
I hate nearly every aspect of my life
I hate my skin
I hate my bones
I hate my hair and teeth and smile and face
I hate my room. Incomplete and never clean. Even after I clear it up, it becomes hellish again. I can't keep up with anything 
I hate my dysfunctional family 
My dad and my mom and my brother
I can't truly talk to any of them
Can't make dad mad
Can't relate to mom
Can't understand my brother
I hate my inability to do anything worth mentioning
I hate my inability to write and I loathe my desire to write because of it
I hate my existence
How I have to wake up every day to another argument, somehow the same as the day before
The way I never seem to feel like I belong anywhere 
My closest friends, the majority would truly be just as fine without me
They all would be
I hate my voice and laugh and I hate thinking I could have ever been something significant 
I am nothing special
I am nothing to mention 
And I hate this world
I love this earth and I would love to just be a spectator 
This world is poison
I hate money and that no amount will ever seem sufficient 
I hate the fact we live and exist to harvest green papers that mean absolutely nothing beside what the earth was built to provide naturally 
I hate this damaged and horribly flawed structured existence we are expected to follow
I hate money
I hate so much and I'm sad so much
My life is black with white punctuation 
And recently I've only felt it becoming darker
I will never love
I can't deal with relationships. I'm not a romantic and I don't want someone to invest so much time in me 
I'm not worth their brain capacity and I don't want to be on their mind and I don't want anyone to worry about me because they're not going to fix anything
I have thought before how my family would be if I would die
Since sixth or seventh grade
I have wanted to spectate and see how my family would unravel at my death 
At how insignificant my absence would be overall
If someone missed me, my role would be overtaken at some point
I have been thinking that I have depression and lately it seems to be getting worse. Maybe it always has been. I hate my life. I hate being stuck in this human that I am. I am confined and swarming with hatred and what I can only describe as a raw sensitivity to sadness 
I keep thinking how it would be, saying ""what if I just killed myself?"" Or how I could
I visualize myself being killed in car accidents. Overdosing on something. Cutting myself open. Usually it's just the thought, ""I don't want to be alive.""
I don't want to be here. I have said that for so long and I still am. 
I'm not even crying right now. I'm not even at a depth and these thoughts still apply. 
My future is pointless. I have these empty, valueless, worthless, stupid dreams of having a beautiful large house, of being able to travel and go to Sweden and France and Ireland and everywhere. I have this ignorant, blind desire to make some people happy someday and it's all pointless. Out of reach. I have no skill and I have no motivation. I am a waste of space, a waste of potential, and I do nothing in my life that substantiates my existence here. I don't want to be here anymore. 
Thinking of ever creating my own family is a joke. I have none and I won't. I carry the weight of my family. I am the designated peacemaker who isn't capable of having problems of her own. I am the therapist that says nothing while absorbing the hatred and disappointment of everyone else. I'm supposed to be something special. I'm supposed to be smart and accomplished and something to be proud of. 
I am okay sometimes but my relapses into depression are coming in shorter gaps every time. It might be a permanent state of mind soon. Maybe my positive days are just empty optimism. 
I always thought I would die at a young age. That would mean to me within five years. I am 18. I could die today. 
I don't want to die and even more so, I don't want to live. I want to be a spectator or nothing at all. 
I don't want to be seen, acknowledged, or worried about. I want to feel better but I've been this way for so long. I feel like I'm at the bottom of a pit. "
"I am ready for the endI dont have anything to be alive for, when people remind me of what I do have it makes me feel worse for not being happy. 
All I have ahead of me is a life of pain, Borderline and suffering - everything good will be blighted by bad. Fuck this and Fuck living - there is no hope left for me. I just need codiene, it will stop my heart beating. Once I have codiene, which I am addicted to, my pain will be over. 
I am going to take over 60 pills, I am going to die.
I just needed to get this out, thank you for hearing. While its all over for me, if you are depressed there is hope for you still, dont let go."
Am I the only one?Am I the only one that wishes someone would kill me so I wouldn't have to do it myself?
"Am I too judgemental of my friends?I met Tom in high school we were part of a good friend group. We partied a lot our senior year and then when we graduated I moved across the country for school he went into the military. It's been six years from my senior year, and I finally decided to go home.

Tom is home for the summer. After serving five years in the military, he was discharged along with his girlfriend. They moved in together to go to college. They are both 24 and this summer they are taking off and not working they are staying at Tomâs parents rent-free. We usually go out drinking a couple of nights a week.

They always like to get blackout drunk and can be loud. Tomâs girlfriend usually puts glasses from the bar that she thinks is cool in her purse. Tom thinks it's funny and encourages her to do it they say the bars get those glasses for free, so it doesn't matter. We're from a liberal state I'm LGBT. He and his girlfriend pride month tweeted:
 âI don't care if youâre gay or straight, i have plenty of friends that are both. But pls stop forcing it on us who just wanna be left out of it.â


I find it hurtful when they tweet that stuff. He and his girlfriend also tweet out slut-shaming things like:

âWhat do women do after theyâve slept with everyone and still don't find love?

Post âmen ain't shit.â

I think it's funny they like this stuff because when tom is single, he'll sleep with anything that walks he's a known dog. In the past, he's talked about how he'd slept with a lot of women and âshout out to women with no self-respect.â He's also been caught sexting other girls while he's been in this relationship. So I don't understand why he puts down promiscuous woman. They post on social media always trying to look like the perfect couple.


I want to distance myself from him, but Tom is a long-time friend. I feel like an asshole judging them so much. Am I the asshole for wanting to ghost these people? I feel emotionally drained should I stop the friendship? Would that make me an asshole?"
"How do I tell my mom?For me, suicidal thoughts have always been kind of numbing. Sometimes, Iâll feel nothing at all, but I have the desire to not exist. I know that suicide isnât the answer. Trust me. I just canât shake them. I think I have undiagnosed depression and anxiety... but how do I bring this up to my mom? Iâve been having periods where I want to die since I was in the 8th grade (college freshman now) but itâs gotten so bad recently that Iâve flunked out of a class. Iâm used to being a straight A student, so this feeling of failure is only making things worse. I just canât force myself to get out of bed and go to class. I come up with excuses for staying in a pitch black room all day... but I know that isnât healthy. I just donât know how to start a conversation with my mom or how to get help, and Iâm scaring myself because Iâm beginning to legitimately consider suicide as a way out. I just need help getting help. "

"I turn 30 today and life surprised me.I thought I would be someone by this age. I never had concrete goals but being a single 30 year old lady who works a lame job and lives in a shitty apartment wasn't high up on my list. I wasted my entire life, the best years are all gone now and I literally never lived at all. Worst of all today I got a wedding invitation from a girl who I was once friends with (we had a competitive friendship) and to see someone actually succeeding in life hurt me a lot (which I know is pathetic, I should be happy to them). People are marrying and having kids and I haven't ever even dated. I know it's too late to change things. I should have done so much when I had the time-things could be so different now. I would matter. People would care about me. In life I always fantasized about having someone be interested in things I had to say or my opinion or even something stupid like my favorite book. My biggest regret is that I never had a love in this life, even if it's not true I want to believe when this life ends I might get another chance and I could live better."

"Want to die so bad.I'm depressed. Insecure. Really posting this out of extreme desperation. I'm 14 and I feel horrible about my body. I'm too ashamed to admit my weight. I feel ugly, useless. I want to lose weight but my pig parents won't support me. They continue to have the ""eat what we have or don't eat at all"" mentality - and what do we have? Junk. Sugary shit.  I can't exercise much because no one is willing to go with me and I'm young so I can't go alone. I'm so depressed and I have been since the beginning of the summer and it's hitting me like a train now. I've warped my image of myself and I think I'm going to end it all soon. 

And by the way, I'm not kidding about being on here out of desperation. I have no idea how this site works or anything. I probably fucked up on the ""category"" thing too. I'm sorry."
"Can someone give me the details?So, I have had suicidal thoughts at least once a day for many years.
I've had therapy for several years, have been to a psychiatrist for a while and have had several different treatments/madication. 

My options are ending very soon. This seems like the most sensible option for a lot of people.

I am a coward/lazy and am looking for the easiest method. My choice so far is by train. However I don't know what are the odds of surviving this way and would like to know as I don't really want to fail. How effective is the average train in Europe?

Sometimes I wish we had American gun laws :)

"There is literally almost no downsides of me dying.So, why not to just try then? But of course my death might cause pain to my parents and such, but they deserve it in every way honestly."
"I almost died today. I WANT TO KEEP LIVING AND SO DO YOU.Hello reddit. Today I almost died. I'm still in quite a shock, but I believe I must share what I learned with you all.
Sorry for the wall of text, but do read my story, I hope it may help you somehow.

Long story short about my past:
I was a cutter from 13 to 16. Back then all I wanted was to die, but didn't have the guts to do it. Of course, when I was 16 years old I cut myself severely and after a while I decided that, even though my life had many problems, cutting and thinking about death wouldn't solve anything.

All this time I had a very dedicated psychologist. She helped me through all the process.
A year ago, 21 years old, I went through a very traumatic experience and I simply wasn't coping with it. After some time my psychologist decided I should see a shrink to get me on meds.
I did as she said and it wasn't too long until I went back to cutting.
The problem, however, was that this time I REALLY wanted to kill myself. I overdosed while drunk twice, I was also taken to the hospital due to severe cutting (that night especially I didn't think anyone would find me... I wanted to bleed to death, but anyway... doesn't matter), etc etc etc...
I was on the verge (and still am) of being institutionalized due to this behavior.

I've been thinking about killing myself for a long time now. The only reason that keeps me going is my mother. I lived just not to break her heart.

----

SO TODAY I was mad at absolutely everything over some really stupid shit. I was supposed to meet my best friend but texted him to cancel it, since I wasn't in the mood. I was going to buy a new razor and cut myself again.
My best friend called me before reading the text, saying he was already on his way to meet me so I decided to go, warning him I was in a really bad mood.

We eventually got drunk. He really cheered me up, so I decided I would be on my way home, have dinner and go to bed... again to wait for ANOTHER POINTLESS DAY... How lame...

So we were on our way home and, in our drunk wisdom, we thought it was a GREAT idea to take a walk in a pontoon (a floating dock, wtv) by the river (a very disgusting and smelly one, by the way).

We were drunk. It was dark. It was cold (yeah, it's winter). There were barely no lights. I remember reading a sign saying something like ""warning, don't cross, danger of falling in the river"". I thought to myself ""yeah, right!""

So we were in the middle, I notice I was getting off balance, so I turned back to be in balance again. There were pretty big spaces between the steps, but I never thought they would be enough for me to fall in the water... in fact... I thought if I fell there would be some kind of platform before reaching the water. YEAH RIGHT.

I fell.
I was underwater for about... ten seconds(?)... but it seemed like hours... I can't even describe.
I didn't really understand what was going on, neither had I any sense whether I was upside down or not. The only thing I realized was that I was going down fast and that I wanted to swim up.
That was the only thing I cared about. I wanted to go up up up up!!!

So finally I see my friend, hanging like a monkey or something, trying desperately to save me. I had two books in my hands and I think he told me to forget about them. No way sir, books must be saved. I threw the books as far as I could so they could reach safe ground and then came the hardest part... Me getting out of there.

I was really deep. There was NO ONE around: NO ONE. I was losing strength, my friend tried to pull me up and I hit with my head twice on that damned dock and fell again.
At this point he thought I was giving up, so he kept insisting that I had to be strong, to hold his hand, to keep trying.
I wasn't giving up. I was of course just half awake, losing my grip, but never did giving up passed through my mind. I just needed to calm down and get a grip.
So I finally get enough strength to get my legs on a little step and my friend did the rest. Pulled me and I was finally safe.

I was dizzy. I wasn't sure of what I was feeling. Now I know. I realized: I don't want to die.
I could have died. My friend could have not been able to help me, there was no one around, it was dark, it was cold, I didn't even know what was going on.
When I realized I lived... Guys, I mean it.... I don't want to die anymore.
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter how much you suffer. There is nothing as pointless as a ridiculous death. You may think you are unworthy, unloved, living a pointless life,... Well, maybe you are going through some tough shit and believe me, I know what you feel like.

But understand when I tell you this:
When you are about to die the only thing that goes through your head is living. If you are thinking about taking your life right now remember this. You will want to live. BELIEVE ME: YOU WILL! All of us want to live even if we don't know it. When the time comes... earlier than what it should... all you want is to live another day, see another sunset, smile at someone you love.

Guys, don't do it. No matter how hard it is, there is always a way. For me, as ridiculous as it can be, this incident made me realize how much I actually love my life and the ones in it.

It is worth it :) Be strong people!

With love."
"How long have you considered Suicide? What keeps you going?I had my first suicidal thought at the age of seven. I lived in an abusive religious family, and was suffering the effects of isolation and low self esteem even then. 

Since then, it has been an on and off thing. I had a very suicidal teens and early twenties.

I find myself running out of reasons to live. I don't really have family, money, a plan, or a future. 

I was curious about others here."
"Just one reason.Well...this is the first time I've posted here and I can't even be bothered to use a throwaway. So...I've been, I don't even want to say it...depressed, for around five-ish years now. Just recently, I've picked up self-harm, maybe a month or two ago. They've started getting deep, and some have gotten as long as three inches. And...yeah. I've been considering suicide for as long as I can remember. While I have a few friends I associate with...I'm utterly alone. I've lost everyone I could confide in, and I feel as if I could disappear and no one would notice, not even my family, where I live. And in all honesty, I feel the day coming where I will at least attempt...and it's coming soon. I don't know where else to turn. I don't even need a reason to do it anymore. I need a reason not to.

EDIT: I just want to thank the amazing people on this subreddit for their kindness. It's good to know that there actually are some good people out there."
"That awkward moment when you lie to yourself for 4 years convincing yourself she loves you when she doesn'tShe tells me I'm great and she loves me but when I need her most she tells me no because I'm not her priority. 

Big woop okay I fuckin get it your obedience to your parents is more important than your loved one's feelings. It's not like we're fucking kids or just met. I break my back to give you everything. I give you a home but you don't even want to live in but tell me you love me okay sure fucker. I give you food, I give you gifts, I make you soup when you're sick, I listen to you when no one else will, I dedicate every day of my life working so you don't have to. 

And at the end of the day all I get is a ""I cant stay the night with you. My parents say no""

How fuckin high are you. How fuckin high was I these past few years crying out to you but somehow you convince me every time not to leave I'm done. I need to be done if I can possibly scrape the fragments of my life together.

"I canât make it any moreIâm burned out completely. I donât see any reason to live any more. I donât want kids, my career is a dead end, Iâd never be able to achieve my dreams. 

Iâm still alive only for one reason - weâre gonna have a huge event this week and Iâm too involved into it to be post-mortem cursed for an ethernity if I kill myself now. 

Iâm battling my suicidal thoughts by thinking that iâm a pussy and wouldnât be able to do it but catch this - I had an attempt before. And it was spontaneous. My mind is desperately trying to keep me out of another attempt but there is still a chance that it would turn itâs back around for a minutes and thatâs it. Mom will be sad, dad will be sad, my cat wonât understand why i donât visit parents any more, my roommates will be forced to pay more, i mean haha yes.

"26/WOC I NEED A REASON TO LIVEI have made 2 attempts since I was 15 and have been suicidal on and off. I donât believe Iâm fearless enough to go through with it but I think about dying a lot. I always pretend to be happy and listen to other people but Iâm hurting inside for so many reasons. No one knows Iâm hurting. I donât think anyone knows me and all of the things I have done and been through. I want to heal and never thought I would really become more bitter and hurt.

I want a relationship but I donât feel like I have ever been loved before. My father was a mess and had anger issues. My mother was physically and mentally abusive and I lived with her in a farmland area so I have a lot of direct personal trauma. School was my escape. Then I became homeless for a while and it has been hard to finish. I feel like a failure in life like people laughed at me for failing when I was trying so hard. I donât ever tell anyone about this but who would care?

âYou have to have a boyfriendâ I am damaged and afraid to be myself or open up because they donât care. I know in todayâs world Iâll never find someone that will understand me without judgement. I canât even imagine anyone with that amount of kindness in their heart to be a good person. People come and go while I pretend Iâm okay.I have a problem and I wish the pain would stop.

Now I have an okay job. I do my job. They offer resources that keep my mind balanced so I wanted to get pregnant and have a happy baby that will love me for who I am. 

I know itâs not the best decision but I think it would give me a higher purpose to live."

"An indecisive dumbass.The title is practically my job description, I'm all of the above and more, but that's not what this is about. For whatever reason whenever I consider suicide or go out of my way to ask myself ""Why dont I just do it today?"" I reach the same conclusion, Im apperently choosy about when a good time to off myself is, not the best skill but sure is a good icebreaker. Not picky and choosy in a way like ""I want to live to see this"" more like a ""if I commit today people will think its because of what happened last week"" which seems strange but I guess makes sense considering my personallity, a people pleaser. Quick example, my entire friendgroup left me without reason (or they just didnt bother to tell me) strange but eh, no more than a week after that I thought about the usual suicide talk with myself but got pulled back to earth when I remembered people might think its only because my friends left and not that I was suicidal before hand.

High school *is* important in your life and don't let your parents or siblings invalidate your feelings during this crazy journey we all gotta go through. High school is a time where you really get to meet some new people and learn some things about life as a whole. You have a right to feel everything you wanna feel during the ups and downs of it, and as cheesy as sounds, it all contributes to helping build who you are in the long run. But take that with a grain of salt, because high school isn't going to decide your life, it's just a time to experience some new things, good and bad, and build yourself up. Also, grades aren't everything so chill out a bit, you won't remember that FÂ you got on the midterm, I promise you.

In whatever part of life you're going through right now you *have to* stop and smell the roses. If you don't have little memories to look back on to enjoy and smile about then you're rushing through life a lil too fast. Buy your ma some flowers, take that little walk through the fall leaves, play some among us with the homies, you won't regret it.Â Â 

One last thing real quick, you know what you're doing so don't second guess yourself! I don't care how old you are or how much people tell you that you're wrong or wouldn't understand. Be honest with yourself and stand up for what you know, confidence is absolutely key myÂ awesome peoples. In the words of Billy Joel's *Vienna*, ""You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need. Though you can see when you're wrong, you know  
You can't always see when you're right. you're right."" Â 

I love you all, and you look fucking amazing today. See y'all later."

My body is still skinny fat even after focusing heavily on compound lifts and eating lots of protein and centring my whole life around fitness, and I've realised that this isn't going to change. The skinny fat physique is absolutely the worst body type a man could ever have and since I'm stuck in this body forever, I've realised that there's no point in living anymore. Women won't ever want someone so hideous and no one respects a man who is out of shape. They'll see me as a guy who doesn't even take care of my health, yet I do the absolute opposite. 

I can't leave the house because of my body. How thin my wrists look, how scrawny my arms are, how skinny I look in the body, and how flat my ass is. Despite training solidly in the gym and actually getting my nutrition in check, my body is still the same as it was ages ago. It's not going to change. I always convinced myself that if I tried something slightly different then I'd make progress, but it never happened. It's more evidence that I can't do anything right. 

Now I don't see the point in living anymore. If I can't leave the house, enjoy life, build muscle as a person who loves fitness, experience love and sex like normal people, life just isn't worth living anymore. It's like wanting to be a writer but having every single piece of work you've written be rejected or hated by everyone. Imagine how crushed you must be to try everything yet still fail. 

Thanks for everything. Well, actually, thanks for nothing. I put in so much and got so little in return. Fuck you. "

"Why me?As a young kid, my father used alot of drugs. Abused my mother and always left us behind. My sister was 8 &amp; I was 6, when she started cutting into herselt. As a young boy, I didnât understand the motive behind that. Why would such a beautiful girl do that to herself? She burned herself, cut herself &amp; multiple times in the hospital for an almost fatal suicide/overdose. I was young, so I thought this was normal. I started cutting myself at a really young age. Cutting the pain away, multiple suicide attempts, but never succeeded. Walked around with these questions I could not ask to no-one, because no one understands me. Still to this day, I feel worthless; craving for a little bit of happiness. Everyone leaveâs me because I am nothing worth &amp; should have never born, but then I ask why; how can I not kill myself? Am I a coward or is there still hope left for me somewhere. I just want to leave this horrible place &amp; be happy one day."

"Problem with Science I just realized half of science is actually mistake of previous scientists and their misconceptions still being taught to us.
Like we are taught that atoms of same elements are alike but that was a misconception of scientists before they found isotopes.
Then some guy said that current flows from higher potential to lower potential, which is even more serious of a lie as it is never told clearly to students. They are told like electrons flow from (-) to (+) but for convention we treat as if current flows from (+) to (-). But if you think about it current is flow of charges and charges are clearly flowing in the opposite way.
Then Newtons Gravitational law, it was wrong or maybe incomplete whichever you say.

Bio is an exception tho, 

But then there's a more dangerous thing, the names. Like how high were you to name things like that? Couldn't you just name them in English? Why Latin, just why?
Gain of electron is called Reduction! Seriously? 
And many more examples which I cant remember atm.
And Bio names, what were you guys naming? A monster ?

Phalanges, sounds like a dangerous monster but worry not it's just your finger bones.

"Mods removed my post from r/nosleep twice so I figured Iâd try here The Couple Who Wonât Leave My House 

-


When I woke up this morning, I was on my bed slumped over against my bedroom wall. My arms parallel to one another, facing away from my sides. My head also slumped over. Normally I would have found that weird, but I was too distracted by how great I felt. Youâd think that after a nights sleep like that, Iâd be in a lot of pain, but Iâve never felt better

I just brush it off as something I must have done in my sleep, and pick up my book. Itâs a book about realization. Itâs contains a lot of real stories about how  someone realized something about themselves and how it completely changed their lives. I really like it so far. I hope some day something like these stories will happen to me. 

And then I hear the front door open. My parents are back! Theyâve been in a lot of emotional distress recently, so they went on a vacation... I think. They havenât been talking to me for a while now, so I can only assume they went on this vacation because of me. As I head towards the stairs, I can hear them talking. Except it doesnât sound like them... these arenât my parents. 

I stop dead in my tracks. Part of me wants to go down there and tell them theyâre in the wrong house. But what if theyâre bad people? What if they try to hurt me? Instead, I double back and hide under my bed.



-




Itâs been a couple of hours now, and they havenât left. Theyâve been coming in and out for the past couple of hours. Are they moving in? They eventually stop and, from what I can hear, start checking out each room in the house. They eventually get to mine. 

The door opens and I hear the lady gasp. 

âIs- is this it?â she asks. 

The room falls silent, but I can tell the man nods. 

I want to start crying but I tell myself, â*No Eliot, theyâll hear you!*â. They leave the room, closing the door behind them. I want to leave but Iâm too scared. Iâll stay for now. They got to leave some time, right?



-



Itâs been three days, and they havenât left. All Iâve heard is them laughing, talking about how they want to spend the rest of their lives in this place. Iâm starting to get angry. Iâve been under this bed for three days, and I donât plan on spending another second here. I crawl out and head towards the stairs, when I see something in my parentâs room that catches my eye. 

Itâs filled with boxes and framed photographs of the couple. But that wasnât what caught my eye. My fathers gun, just sitting there on the dresser. I donât know why, but I grab it and head downstairs to find the couple. 

Everything is so different now. There are tons of boxes stacked to the ceiling, just waiting to be opened. I stop at the bottom of the stairs, when I hear the couple talking in the living room. The lady says she found this framed picture in the basement and something about âthis is what they looked likeâ? But Iâm too angry to pay attention. 

When I arrive at the living room, the lady looks up at me, and screams. The man does the same. I look at both of them and ask,

âWhat are you doing in my home?â

They donât respond. They look terrified. I wasnât sure why, until I saw I was still holding the gun. I look back up at them and I realize they arenât even looking at me, theyâre looking at the gun. I wave it around and their eyes follow. 

They donât even see me. 

This fills me with rage. And before I even realize it, I shoot the man. Two time in the chest, one in the neck. Blood splatters all over the ladyâs face, as she screams and cries after watching her lover die. I shoot the lady until Iâm out of bullets. 

I grab the picture they weâre looking at, and take a look. I notice my reflection right away. Itâs been days since Iâve seen myself. I look normal, except I notice a dried blood stream on the left side of my cheek, and two holes on my temples. One roughly the size of a bullet.  And then I see the picture itself. 

Itâs me. 

And itâs not the picture that surprises me, itâs the words above it.

"I want outIâve dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for years, but in all seriousness the only reason I havenât killed myself yet is because of my mom. She is the only reason I have left to stay here. However, my dumb ass did something (really) bad a while back, and she found out about it. She said it best herself, the parent-child relationship requires trust, and I lost hers. She has put up with my shit for years, but I think this is the last straw.

"I got help!! And I think that I might want to die some day in far away future for nowSome good day I started to feel the need to scape, I couldnât breath, focus and nothing that I do felt enough, everything that I do I considered crap and I was an awful person and friend, and boyfriend, and basically I star to look for reasons to go cause I considered that die would be the best for the people that get to know me. 

But I get help cause some other part of me was piss off, and know that something has to make sense in all this haze of feelings and suicidal thoughts.

So I went to the psychiatrist and she evaluated me, and diagnosed me with depression and pathological anxiety , what it means is that basically my brain was overload with neurotransmitters that make you feel the need to survive all the time, they never went off like in most people, and now I have to take some ansiolitics (I donât know how to write them in English), they are not addictive and I started to feel normal, I didnât think that someday I would feel like this, sometimes I still have bad days but now i have the strength and the ideas to deal with the world.

I tried to tell you this so you know that whatever happened to you, it will never go the only thinking you can do is learning to deal and face it, now you might feel that thereâs no exit but thatâs your brain once you get a little help at that molecular level you star to see the solution
 
In another words there is hope and not everything will be perfect but you will have the power to change it.

Now I hope that some of you read this I star you journey to heal, and if you need someone whom you can talk about anything you can reach me."

Iâve gotten into two car accidents with her car and all I do is cause her trouble. I love her so much and I know she loves me but she canât handle what a drain I am and I hate seeing myself drag her down. 

For three years sheâs been the only reason I havenât killed myself. Because I didnât want her to deal with the consequences. but tonight she talked about all the things that are wrong with me. Yelled at me for getting into anothwe wreck. Spoke about all the things I hate about myself and all the reasons I think Iâm better off dead. 

I know it will hurt her. To find her girlfriend missing or worse, dead. But Iâve been holding myself together so she wouldnât be alone and with no money comin in and no passion for life at all, am I really with her the way I should be? She just admitted to wanting to break up with me finally if I donât get my shit together but I donât know how guys. I really donât. 

I really canât do this anymore. I donât even know if I try really hard or not at all or... I just donât want to do this. I hate where I am and who I am and I can move all over thdonât country but I can never learn to like myself at all. All I do is cause misery for others and Iâm tired of burdening them and watching them pick up after my failures. 

I just hope that in my next life I know how to learn from mistakes and can be better.

"i just need to tell this to someonei don't know whom to talk to, i feel so lonely, so i write this here. i thought my suicidal thoughts were over, i knew they would come back, but not so strongly, not so badly. i thought that i finally found a way to live my life in peace, without worrying whether i would survive for another month or not, without worrying about what my family and my friends would  miss me if i took my life, feeling even guiltier. today they came back though, i should have expected it. i can't find a reason to keep living, i feel like everything i do is meaningless. why do we keep living, how is possible that people live so happily, not thinking about death all the time? am i different? do i really belong here? i thought so, but I'm not sure, because if everyone thought like i do, there would not be so many people around.

"Life: it's pointless... or maybe it's just that I don't see it.I don't see the point in life. Or is it that others don't see how pointless it is? Suicide? In consideration. 
Why is life pointless? It just is. You live to die. You live to learn to work to die. You live just to serve the needs of society or whatever to die. Some people say you can get lots of good out of life. I don't see that. Friends, family, woo-hoo? No. In the end you die, you lose them all. It's the same, earlier or later. Maybe dying earlier is even better, since you will have a weaker bond and the separation won't be as painful. You get little good things out of life, but you do get a lot of bad things. Sadness, learn, and eventually work. That's life.. It's.. pointless. Why am I doing all this? Why am I even living? It's not like I'm being negative, it's the truth. Why don't others see it? After you read this, people that give support on reddit, do you see how pointless life is? Do you understand? Does someone understand?

"I will never be good enough. I mean, really. I have an eating disorder, I'm stupid, I'm annoying, I have social anxiety, I have depression, my grades are shit, I can't do anything right, my relationship is starting to fall apart... and everything just sucks. I'm just not worth it. I am a waste of fucking space. *I cannot even function as a normal human being.* I do not deserve to be alive, and I do no *want* to be alive.

I do not particularly wish to be dead, because what I *really* want is to be able to function like a regular person. You know? I want to be able to eat and not feel guilty. To smile and fucking mean it. To have an awesome relationship (I did for a while). To get good grades. To wake up in the morning and feel like I can get the hell out of bed and face the day. But it's starting to look more and more that I'll never get that, no matter how much I want it.    
So my only real option now is death. And why the hell not? I would be helping other people by getting rid of an annoying presence in their life. My boyfriend would be free to finally move on to some other bitch. Whatever financial aid I'm getting for college could be saved for someone who will actually be successful. And hell, I'm an organ donor, so hopefully I could even help someone like that.   
And it would be so... easy. It would take me maybe ten minutes to get one of the guns ready. Ten minutes. I could be dead in ten fucking minutes. That's amazing. 

I don't know. I just feel really, really worthless. And my relationship is the thing I depend on for life... even just the thought of it ending has me crying until I can hardly breathe. I love him so much... and he says he loves me too, but I guess all my issues are just too much to handle, which is understandable. It just sucks. I just want to dissolve into space. I don't have the fucking courage it would take to kill myself, no matter how much I think about it, and I can't seem to fix any of my issues. Basically, I'm stuck with this shit for the rest of my life (which is probably going to be painfully long). I'll never be able to function as a human being should. What do I do about that? 

I'm sorry for the rant. :/ 

I guess what I'm trying to ask is... how do I fix all this? I just don't know what to do. I mean, I know I should go back to therapy, but that never really helped. I'm going to try to get antidepressants in the next few months, but I really need something for the time between now and then. I want to stop wanting to die. :( 

Ugh, this is terribly disorganized. I apologize again. I'm kind of a shitty writer, too. Go fucking figure. "
"I feel like I've failed and I don't know who to talk to anymore.My life has been out of control. I've been struggling with depression for the last 5-6 years. Ever since my sister was kicked out of the house, and then I was too a year later. I had to move in with my dad all the way across the country away from everything I had ever known where my step-mother and step-sisters were emotionally abusive. At one point, my laundry was thrown on the lawn and as I went to go pick it up, the door was slammed and locked in my face with one of them saying ""I was here first."" I ended up breaking a window and slicing my hand up as I banged on it to try and get someone's attention to let me back inside. My dad finally moved us out my senior year. Then I went off to college in another state to try and get away from that small town and just that state in general. I went to college with almost no financial support other than what the school was able to give me. I tried going to school counselors several times but they scared me, made me feel judged, and one of them basically told me he was surprised I wasn't suicidal with everything I had told him. But I didn't tell him I mildly was. I ended up in the hospital in a terrifying event and it was like after that I just didn't want to try anymore. Everything spun downward. I couldn't get myself out of bed. I slept a lot because whenever I felt bad I would just fall asleep. It kind of made it all go away for a second. Last semester it was constant nightmares. Every night, and unrelenting. And I still have them. One time, they started before I was even asleep. Every time I closed by eyes I felt scared and so I just didn't sleep and would stay awake all night long and then eventually fall asleep in the day time from complete exhaustion. Over break I saw my family which I thought would really be nice and it just turned awful. Every argument I would have with my sister would send me into this trance state that I couldn't get out of. I felt like I've been able to fake happy for a long time to satisfy people. But it was like I couldn't fake it anymore. And this trance. It was me contemplating death and I didn't like it. It scared me. It was thoughts of how it could happen accidentally. How it could happen with minimal impact on the few people that might actually care. And now, I'm about to be kicked out of my house because I got behind on my rent. I just feel like I'm tired of trying to fight. It's like I don't have anything left."
"I want to disappearI am 18. By all means, I should be very happy. I am lucky enough to have a great family, a great boyfriend, and to go to a very prestigious university. I am lucky enough to have people to talk to, lucky enough to not have to worry about money, and lucky enough to have amazing opportunities everywhere. I should be very happy. 

I am not happy, hence why I am writing this. I have struggled with depression and anxiety and body image issues for a long long time. I am a drain on society and on everyone that I love. For my parents, I am a waste of the love and money they have put into me. Without me, they could save the extremely expensive tuition and put it towards something else. I have a sister anyway, who's fundamentally a better human being than I am. They don't need me. 

For my boyfriend, he is the only person I've really felt like I could talk to, and I know I'm just a drain on him, emotionally and time wise. He goes to a physically and mentally demanding school, and I know without me, he would be so much happier. He'd have more time and more energy, and he wouldn't miss me. I'm watching him now (we're video calling as we work) and he's so happy when he's not talking to me. As soon as I say something to him, his face drops. I feel like he's only with me because he feels like he should. If I was gone, he could find someone so much better than me. I love him so much, but he doesn't need me. 

My friends do not care about me. It's still freshman year. They'd be fine. They'll find new friends. They don't need me. 

I have dreams and aspirations, but those seem like they'll never pan out. Everyone has always thought that I'm a ""happy"" and ""bubbly"" person. But really, I'm just a disgusting person who's too fat and ugly for people to care about and who just uses up resources that someone else could have. I hate myself, and I always have. I made a plan to kill myself at 16, never went through with it because I thought I was happy. I should've known better, because I'm never really happy. I want to go away. I want to be happy, but I know I won't be. 

I've thought about calling someone. I've gone to therapy in the past. I made an appointment with my school's counseling and psychological services, but that's in a week. I considered talking to the clinician on call, but I'm not in an 'urgent mental crisis'. I considered calling the suicide hotline, but I would just be using resources they need for someone else. 

Knowing me, I'm too weak to even kill myself. I just need the courage, I guess. I just feel numb and alone, and I can't stop thinking about how easy it would be to stop living. But I probably wouldn't even be able to go through with it, and I hate myself for that. To be honest, I don't even think I should be making this post. Just wasting people's time. So I guess if you've made it this far, sorry for wasting your time. I'm sorry."

"[F18] Feeling the urge to attempt for a 4th time after 5ish years without feeling so lowFor context: Iâm 18F, I have a 19F girlfriend, my biological mother 39, step dad 42, half sister 8, not step dadâs kid, and step siblings F22, M14, M11. 

Iâve made several attempts in the past, ever since I was 12. Telling my mom I was suicidal years ago was answered with âthen go kill yourself, see if I care.â

My stress levels are at an all time high between college, threats of being kicked out, threats of rent, my relationship, my crazy step dad and sister, of being ghosted by potential employers, traveling, etc. Iâm on Zoloft for anxiety and depression, lost my father at age 2, my half sisterâs father tried to rape me on multiple accounts and my mother refused to call the cops on him bc of my sister. My step father, who came into my life around age 15, frequently calls me a monster and accuses me of trying to tear my family apart. My step sister constantly instigates fights and talks crap, then turns around and treats me like her best friend so she can use my art supplies and my car. 

I feel like my mother doesnât want or love me and like the world will be a better place without me in it. The only people who would care are my gf, my little sister, and my M11 step sib, and these three people are the only reason i havenât attempted these past years. Perhaps my one other friend, but no one else, really. I refuse to go back to therapy bc my mother will make my life hell again. 

Iâm currently alone at Epcot on vacation with the family (they guilted me into going), after my mother told me to go away because I was ruining everyoneâs appetite during lunch, after my step sis instigated another fight that only i got yelled at for. Calling my gf ended with lots of âYouâre stronger than this,â and âyou need to calm downâ and âstop talking about what happened.â So I figured Iâd post here for the first time."

"Quick opinion folks. IMPORTANT too! I had this kind of argument with a Dutch friend who is a female.

Apparently, she thinks that a boy can wear bras and panties and do all sort of stuff that is feminine but can still be interpreted as a boy by the social world. 

She thinks it is normal for people to do all sort of stuff the other gender does and still identify as the same gender.

I think that doesn't make sense, such a person is not a *boy* anymore from brain, he changes into non-binary/trans/anything else?

Is it normal for people to do all sort of stuff the other gender does and still identify as the same gender? Need your opinion folks."

And then when u feel the sudden urge to poop itâs because the ailiens have gotten a sudden piece of information or sum.

"About people claiming to be passionate about stuff they are not, especially about food and culinary arts ***There will be a lot of swearing proceed with caution!***

I swear to fucking God every time i hear someone saying, holy shit I love cooking and eating so much its my passion, and I know they haven't put a foot and never will put a foot inside a restaurant kitchen it makes me want to knock their fucking teeth out, it really fucking pisses me off. People don't know how truly grueling working in a restaurant is from being the owner to the floor staff, it is one of the hardest industries to succeed at any level just because of the passion you have to show for it, those people who claim to be passionate about cooking and haven't worked 5 days a week for 8-12 hours, sweating your ass off, getting home at 2-3 am, and repeating I swear it pisses me off, they don't know how hard we work to get the menu going, learning the whole menu, and serving it to you, while working in a hot ass kitchen and everything aches because of the stance you have to make, everything itches, there's no real breaks to eat or do anything because you are the only guy at your station. My family lives off restaurants and food has always been my thing, and until i decided to get my hands dirty I realized how hard and shitty of a job it is, so unless you haven't lived the real culinary experience, don't brag about how much you love cooking. Also the people that shit on waiters and restaurant staff fuck you :)"
"Another day stuck being meSo many people have told me the same exact thing. Accept myself, love myself, be myself. When you've walked the path I have, Myself is all I've ever had. No Mom, No Dad, no family...and sure...friends come and go. In the end, it's always been me...left alone. And being alone with my thoughts through years of abandonment, chips away at your confidence and self esteem. Answers to impossible questions remain unanswered. Why didn't they want me? What did I do? Why does it seem like nobody cares? Self pity can only get you so much sympathy, that I have learned at 32yrs. Pity &amp; sympathy are something I resent because it gives the false impression that I'm unequal or not good enough. Eventually the self pity goes away...except it's replaced with: 
Self hatred.
Self Doubt. 
Self Sabotage. 
Because logically there must be a reason they didn't want me? Perhaps I wasn't good enough in there opinion. 
Vitriol sets in...
Sour grapes become the mindset. 
""Who needs them anyway? I don't need anyone. I've only ever been able to depend on myself."" 
Live with no expectations. Depend on no-one
isolate
maintain. 
People begin to annoy you, their very presence is an inconvenience. Others successes become my own shortcomings. The what if's could go on for miles. Still...maintain.
 I no longer fear death, but I don't welcome it either. It's life that I fear, this endless...never ending empty life. Yes it's a view of pure melancholy, but when you've lived through it...it's simply just another day..."
"The loneliness is killing meAbout an hour ago I got up to go shower, I didnât realize how bad it was until I feel on the floor crying and sobbing. Everyone is so busy or having a good time without me. I feel like someone I choking me and pushing me into the floor and I canât get up. When I feel like I might be able to do something basic like eating or going to the bathroom I just break down again.

This week I went through a breakup. Even writing that word it doesnât feel right. It was the only person keeping me alive these past two years and now without him Iâm alone again, whatâs worse is my family and friends had no clue how bad Iâve been these months so theyâre unprepared when I come to them and ignore me or give me crap advice like âexercise or take a break and relaxâ. No one picks up their phone or texts back, if they do they sigh in annoyance and give an excuse to hang up quickly.

Today is maybe the last day for me. I donât see myself past this week and every time I get to this point it feels less and less like Iâll come out alive. Part of me wanted to try getting help but it looks so difficult I might just give up if this pain doesnât stop. Iâm gonna do it."

"I don't think I'll make it through today.I can't do this.

I've had depression and anxiety for 20 years (since I was 8) and I thought I had it under control. Decent meds, a few runs in therapy, and good job. 

But something has come up. My dog's health has declined drastically and we made the choice to put him down to spare him further pain. The appointment is in 9 hours. I logically know it's the right thing to do because he can't control his bladder, and his back legs barely support him. But I just can't help but feel like I'm failing him. I don't know how to get through this.

I haven't slept. I haven't eaten. I can't go 5 minutes without crying so hard I hyperventilate and can't breathe. I've had three panic attacks about it in the past twelve hours. I can't stand the idea of a life without him. My heart is fucking broken.

My problem is that whenever something big happens, I spiral into depression hard and fast. My brain jumps to thinking about suicide immediately because hey, if I'm dead I won't have to deal with it. 

So that's where I'm at right now. I have no specific plans for offing myself but I can't imagine living after today. I just want to stop existing so I don't have to face the pain. I've had more than my fair share of it in my life. I can't take any more. I just can't do this. It hurts too much."

I have been haunted by my past, and I do not know if i can deal with my memories anymore. I have been living in a constant fear these years. In the same time I dont even know if there will be a future for me.

I am gay, and I am an asylum seeker due to my sexual orientation. Due to the immigration crisis in 2015, immigration in europe basically has been turning table, they basically reject and deport everyone except the one from syria. Being back to my home country is not an option, unless i want to be jailed, going to conversion therapy or being exorcist, or being mobbed by the locals. To be honest, I prefer to die in dignity than being sent back there.

I dont know if this life is worth fighting for, I do not know if i want to be alive if I ended up in jail or being mobbed by the locals. While most people having a huge dream, my only dream is to finally find a place that i can call home, and if they did not allow me to live in peace, i dont really mind to rest in peace.

Now tell me, is there any reason why I should stay alive?"

I got fucking scammed and lost 200 usd Hi I am a victim of the new recent scam.Just today I got scammed by someone who somehow had my stean account info.He tricked me by changing my username and description into something that looked like I'm getting VAC ban.He then proceeded to pose as one of my close friends tipping me that I was gonna be ban.Being naive I traded all team fortress 2 items for him to safe keep.Only moments later to realise I had fallen victim to a scam.I checked the history of where my account was being logged on and I pinpoint ot to be from russia.Total I had lost was around 200 dollars.I would like to say guys please watchout and dont fall for scams.Always check what is happening and dont panic.Because I was panicking I lost 1 aussie gold knife (around 40 usd)  5 other unusual  (20 usd each) and some keys (2.60 each).For those of you that want proof u can type in the comments and I'll upload it to imgur and post it here.Todays my birthday and I just feel like crying.

"A little venting I'll try to not make it longMy name is Bryce, I feel like that makes me more comfortable that you all know. I've been struggling with diagnosed depression since 8th grade (I'm a high school junior now). Life has been so great this school year, found a boy I like, averaged a 4.3 GPA last quarter. I love my friends and my band family. Taking 4 AP classes I love. Seeking help for my mental health. About a month ago I started cutting and started burning. In my second period class, someone asked me about how the hand sanitizer+lighter trick worked. I showed them(This was one of the ways I would burn myself) someone was recording me and I got called to the principal's office and now my expulsion is in the process because I committed arson. when my mom dropped me off at home. the first thing I did was grab my Zoloft pills and took about 30 of them.

About five hours later I was throwing them up and was hallucinating. I didn't do my research I guess because overdosing is actually really hard. I spent two days recovering from that. I tied a simple noose to my doorknob and am looking to try again tonight. Made a program to upload a tweet with a google doc that's my suicide note. I tagged one of my friends so it will spread to my other friends. Looking to make a convo before I do it 2nite."

The joys of alcohol. But I canât blame my bro because I too have indulged in alcohol because of my own problems . And now I will do so again because of this whole incident.

I wouldnât be lying if I said I feel like Iâm âdoneâ with living. There may be this tiny fraction or part of me that clings on ever so lightly to hope, but itâll break at the thought of anymore problems. 

Itâs almost like my spirit of life has been broken. Or my effort to even try anymore. I feel like I may become mute. Never speak unless spoken to. Never interact with anyone unless I absolutely have to. I just feel like Iâm a particle floating around in blackness. 

People say life has its ups and downs but I just feel like Iâm this grey, old, disoriented figure walking among the bright beauty of what people call âlifeâ.

"Six months later.Saw the community and wanted to make an account for it. First time on Reddit- but I thought it was a good idea to let this all off my chest. We'll see if the ale beats me to it tonight.

For context. I was dateless in Highschool. Graduated 2017. Now being 21 and my final semester of Trade school. I guess you can say I am proud of that. A lot happened between the two.  
- I reconnected with old gaming/texting buddies from Middle school / early Highschool. 
- I instantly fell in love with this girl who I thought was amazing. We would laugh at everything together. She reciprocated feelings. We started a relationship. 
- Blah blah lovey dovey. She was a state away. OP should try his best to make it all work. I enjoyed every minute I could get with her and my friend group. A good year later. (I know.. a long time right?) It slowly fell apart. She started hanging out with a friend who had a crush on her a 'long time ago'. Yeah. That's cool. But- she spent most of her days with him. Leaving me out there. 
I got terribly jealous (is that o.k.?) I guess I didn't express my feelings enough. But needless to say we took a break. Easy enough. Well , a week later she wanted to meet up like we initially planned. Sure. Anything to fix what we have.
I drive to her state. Half a day. Easy. 

4 hours into settling down at her place. She breaks up with me. Hahah. What? Speechless- away from home. Unaware of the city around me. What could I do? I picked a corner and sobbed away. She couldn't even face me. Until I could leave. Heart broken and Confused. I drive home. Friends and Family pick up on my depressive state. Work was hard. But I pushed through. 

I began to fail my classes. Caused me to pull a massive loan to retake em'

I'm exhausted, poor, drinking every night- hell I got a can in the hand... I'm wanting to leave all of this behind. This small town. This depressive state of being alone. 

Yes. I tried to re-date. Cute. Funny girl. She was being paid to be some neckbeards girlfriend. And chose to stay with him- money pays. I am stunned. I've been keeping my Handgun close to my head. The smallest of inconvenience kills me. Hell it's taken a major toll on my friends. I am not the happy Senior who would do anything. I work school drink sleep repeat. It never ends. And have been left behind to a dark, dank, cold room

"The emptyness is suffocating meHey.
So this is my first post here. Im not really sure how to start.

My name is Daniel, Im 25 years old and never in my life I have felt so lost. I guess im just gonna say that like most of you reading this, im not in the worsts of shapes but im losing the fight.
Im trying really hard, I go to bed early, I wake up go to the gym, I eat well, do yoga and meditation. I try to keep myself active and I keep losing interest in life. I see no point in living.
I have a good family who supports me and good friends. And they are the only reason why I haven't attached a gas mask to my face and killed myself yet.

   I feel broken. Like damaged. I can't enjoy the things I used to anymore.
I can't find joy in love and I don't look for it maybe because all the people that I had, either betrayed me or cause me great harm.
   I have been in love by the same person for almost 10 years now and that love was never mutual.
   She is my best friend, with who I share everything. She shares everything with me and I am the only reason why she hasn't killed herself like her mom did 3 months ago.
   I've lived alot with this girl, happiness and deep cruciating pain. We slept together countless nights. Happy nights, full of care and laughs and nights full of tears and sorrow. She doesn't love me, but she can't truly be happy without me present in her life.
   She tries to keep going with her life and go out with other guys and talk to other people and I am at the same place waiting watching it happen. It's killing me.
    I tried erasing her from my life, every social media, phone number but you just can't erase a past that made you so happy and has to end when none of you did any harm. 

   She suffers from depression and is on drugs 24/7 just to contain the panic attacks she has. I wouldn't live with myself if i just turned my back to her knowing I can end her pain. I wouldn't be able to live knowing she yells cries and begs for help because she literally thinks she is going to die and wants to die.

   Myself, I have been diagnosed with deep depression when i was 13. I learned to live with it throught the years. Ive used my pain to my advantage. Hate is a very strong motivator but know I feel drained. I have to force myself to do the most basic of things. 
   I just feel so empty and I know it's the depression talking, I can't see a future for myself. I just want to die without causing pain to anyone. I've seen what suicide does to the people arround you first hand.
   I lost my childhood friend to a bike accident, and now Im losing the only person who I have a deep connection and could see have somewhat of a future with. She is the solo string of happiness I have at the moment.

   I know that life isnt just this, there's 7 billion of us, there's someone for us but I can't get that through my head. Im slowly creeping back to depression.
   The loneliness and the absence of feeling is going to be the end of me.

I just felt like sharing a bit of my life with whoever feels like embracing my pain. Thanks "
"I'm so done with people Rant warning! Alright so I play this one game where you make and lose ships and basically there's limited ships and all. I spend hundreds of hours making a ship only for the people who, I protected and I helped save their ships, bait me. This has happened like hundreds of times and everytime I trust people it's just how I fucking am. In real life it's the same damn thing. I trust someone and they take advantage of me(most people who aren't my family). It took me way too long to realize 90% of my ""friends"" in the lower grades just wanted me to do their homework for them. Why is it always like this, I keep trusting people and they keep breaking my trust."

":( This came to me in a half-asleep state. Read if you want to.:( I don't know why I am writing this...or if there is a point...or what I am still doing here (was foiled every time I wanted to grab my pills yesterday by kids coming in...having to help with supper...etc.) or...what I am still doing beating this dead horse. No pun intended. You don't need to reply. I think everyone has been super-nice here and they  have said everything that they can say to me. I was just told by a friend that I am not listening to him no matter what he says and that I am determined to kill myself...and he stopped short of saying ""just go do it already..."" I think if he HAD said that...I wouldn't be posting right now. He took this all as a failure on his part and made me feel so bad and guilty. He brought up my family and I ""yelled"" at him saying that I have to hear that constantly and doesn't he think that this is all tearing me up inside? I KNOW it would hurt them...I didn't need that guilt too. You see, he has a HUGE crush on me ever since he'd seen my videos on YouTube, and now he keeps trying to get me to talk dirty to him and be sexual with him over Messenger on Facebook. I keep telling him that I like him as a friend but that I am NOT interested in doing any of that stuff because I am married with a family, which he acknowledges fully!! He makes me uncomfortable. He said he is sorry when he makes me uncomfortable and creeped out, then he continues doing it anyhow. I don't want to lose him as a friend (he is a subscriber on my YouTube channel and helps me with my video stuff too) but I am not sure I can continue since he knows how much I want to die and our friendship has gotten really...weird now. It is awkward almost.

 I can't seem to go through with my plans though, no matter how much I really want to (not very much right now--I feel more cotton-headed than usual) because every time I try, something stops me...I get interrupted...something happens that stops me. My mind won't even let me think about doing it now. Literally! It's like when I try to think about things, my mind goes elsewhere or I hear a high-pitched buzzing and even kind of whispering, but distant and soft. This whispering isn't telling me to do anything specific, it is more like in a church before the service starts and everyone is having soft conversations that have nothing to do with you. 

Anyhow, this story came to me in a half-asleep state (I am also extremely sick with a horrible cold that I have had for about 3 or 4 days now and I spend a lot of my day half-asleep)...can you figure out who the subject is?


Just how long have you been feeling this way? Not sure, but she has been at this a long time. As a teenager, she was never taken seriously when she threatened suicide. They put her away in a hospital many times, but nobody believed she was serious. She was just looking for attention. She was cutting herself for the attention it brings. Many hospitals, no real help. She won't talk to a professional in fears of getting locked away again. It is a vicious cycle that keeps repeating, even though now she is way past the age where teen angst and young problems like this are ""acceptable"" and even though now she has a family to help support and run. These episodes had slept for periods of time as she had borne children, which were the happiest days of her life after getting married. The problems were always there, just buried deep in maternal instincts that not even the darkness could touch.

Now, however, she is cutting once again. She goes through these cycles every few years when the weight of the darkness just can't be tolerated anymore. Long, angry cuts on her arms but nowhere else. Nowhere else is satisfying enough as her arms and the backs of her hands...and her wrists. The cuts hurt, but oh, the pain is lovely and welcomed. Every time that (cutting tool) cuts deeper, it is like a thousand suns shining on her and like her soul can finally fly free...if only for a few minutes. She doesn't care about her problems at home and everything that needs repairs but aren't able to be fixed because the money is just not there. She doesn't think about the fact that her children might come in and find her bloody. It is total freedom.

Then, after a short time, she crashes back to Earth and all the problems from which she had just flown free all come crashing back in on her. All the repairs. The money problems, which aren't TERRIBLY significant, but are there. The need to care for little souls every day of their lives until they are old enough to fly away from the nest. The fact that if they HAD found her bloody and half-out-of-it, that they would have been scarred for life. All of it. Crashing, crushing, tumbling...making her fall back down the pit she was just climbing out of and making her feel helpless and hopeless.

Now we find her laying across her bed, staring at her laptop as she tries to find the motivation to do the one thing she thought made her happy. She stares at the screen where her favorite thing is all ready for her, but she just looks at it, or right through it, and sees nothing but blackness. The darkness has come for her again, and this time, she doesn't know if she even has the will or strength to fight it again. She feels like just giving in and doing what it is telling her she should have done years ago as a teenager...end her life. End her suffering. She thinks of her kids and how they would scream. She can hear them screaming, not in her head, but in her heart. She thinks of her husband, who is trying to be so supportive of her right now, but who also has no clue exactly how to do that. It isn't enough now. It is too little, too late, and she feels herself slipping further and further away from them...and into the blackness which is waiting for her.

She grabs the pills...the only other way she can think of right now and...

...Curtain drops...

Scene.


Sigh. It felt good to type that.

I took my husband to a movie yesterday. We had a real date (day out together while our 16 year old and her girlfriend, who is 18, babysat her siblings) for the first time in forever. It was so nice. I had a nice time. The movie was awesome too but the mood was ruined by the fact that our water heater has broken and we have NO hot water right now. Thank goodness it's under warranty still and will be replaced as soon as we get someone to help hubby take it out of here.

Sorry for the wall of text.
Thanks for everything guys. You don't know how you have all made these past few days almost tolerable for me. I am trying to hold out for Friday. Have that T appointment.

"I have no motivation for life. I don't care about applying for college. I don't care about  getting my driver's license. I don't care about finding a girlfriend (I never will anyways). I don't care about having a family one day (I won't be able to anyways). I don't care about my current failing grades. I just do not care about anything.

Hopefully this misery ends soon."
"I'll die aloneI just finished high school. And I feel very lonely.  It wasnât the best 4 years of my life. I literaly spent my time with no friends, no one to talk to, daydreaming and crying in the corner.
Being 5'9 female sucks. Especially if youâre unattractive and overweight like me. No one cares about you.
Iâm still a virgin. Iâve never been asked out. Never had my first kiss. Never been hugged.  Never been in a relationshipâ¦ Never rejected someone. But instead, I was rejected. Many times. I've always been someone really vulnerable, optimistic, romanticâ¦When I was 10, I thought Iâll have many friends and romantic partners. I thought life would be easy, exciting and that everyone would like meâ¦.I was so wrong. 
Iâm 19 years old and lesbian. I canât imagine a life without a significant other.
I get avoided for any contact, no one even wants to sit by me on the bus. People avoid eye contact with me, girls only want to talk to my cousin and leave me out of plansâ¦
People my age had at least 4 girlfriends. 
I realized that many lesbians (where I live) are like men, they like pretty girls, those who are short, with big boobs, and fancy makeup (usually straight girls). They wonât even look at me because if men donât find me attractive, it means Iâm too ugly for them as well.
It sucks being discriminated in lesbian community where youâre supposed to feel like at home. Iâll probably marry a man and be unhappy for the rest of my life (if someone wanted to marry me).
I guess, Iâll die alone in my parents apartment, in my room, in front of my pc. Thatâs all I have.
I really want to die. I just canât magically become someone attractive enough to be cared about."

"I'm wearing too thinI have cancer and my last surgery was 2 days ago. The doctor refused me pain medication out of some weird philosophy so I've been in constant pain. I have a major mental illness that I can't manage. Money is dwindling and because I'm so sick I can't afford to support my family anymore. 

There isn't really any light at the end of the tunnel and I'm so tired. My body and mind are just so tired. I can't live like this anymore."
"Canât think of a reason not to do itWhen the constant gut feeling says, âYou should do it. You should do it...â

Then all external forces seem to be whispering to me, âYou should do it. You should do it...â

From the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep, the overpowering emotion is, âYou should do it. You should do it...â

It is pervasive when I am at work, when I eat, when I relax, when I exercise. I cannot get rid of it. I just want everything to end and am coming closer to making solid plans. Iâm just tired of everything."
"Overworked, Exhausted, TiredI don't really know where to turn, but I feel like I need to talk about what's going on otherwise I may do something I would probably end up regretting. 

I've struggled with suicidal thoughts &amp; suicidal ideation since I was 13 (22 now) on consistent basis. Sometimes it's daily, sometimes I can manage to go a couple of weeks without feeling like that. It's been daily since about March and it's really starting to get to me. 

I work for three companies, owned under one large umbrella company. I love my work. Though for someone who used to struggle with anxiety at work and could only work part-time, now working three jobs 8-12 hours a day 7 days a week is starting to take a very large toll on myself. I have been pushing day in and day out to get all of my work done on time and still can't seem to finish it all. I wake up to work, and go to sleep to work on a daily basis. I do take some time in between to get my groceries or commute, but that's mainly about it. 

I have a boyfriend who has actually been my best friend for almost 9 years prior. I'm very happy with him and he makes me very happy. However, under this workload and stress I have been very irritable and upset around him which I can see hurts him. I really want to stop being so stressed under the pressure, however I can't seem to control it. 

Recently, I've been running all of my jobs as I normal would with the addition of promoting a very large event for one of those companies. With this event comes a larger workload, more time and more energy pushed into trying to make the event viral. I've been trying to keep a work/life balance in order to stay sane (and stay out of the hospital), however the stress of all of this work has become too much. I've been having panic attacks daily for months.  I've been googling on suicide far too often for me to feel comfortable with, and most days I end up crying/panicking for so long that I loose hours out of my workday from not being able to function (which also means a larger workload that just keeps getting more piled up).

Today was sort of a breaking point for me. See, the company hosting this event has a lot of positive support but also has people who are actively voicing their hatred and anger towards us as well. There were some happenings in the city of the event today that has proved unfavourable for our event and making people hate us even more. As my job is to oversee the feedback coming from the community, I have been reading through what seems like endless messages of malicious threats and comments about our company and this event. 

On the front lines of all this, and the work, I totally broke down today. I'm now sitting on my bed debating on if I keep moving forward or find something to get me out of this. I am so tired of feeling like this and now more than ever, as it seems like there will be no end to the mountain of responsibilities I've tried to take on. This is the furthest I've gone, and I would really like to see myself succeed. However, at this point I don't know if I can keep going. "
A serious question Does anyone know how to out pizza the hut?
"I'm wasting my youth and want to kill myselfI'm 16, I never had a real relationship, literally the only time I kissed a girl was when I was like 5 like holy shit im a loser. I barely have fucking friends, I hate the country that I moved to and I just have nobody to speak to I feel so alone. Nobody understands my loneliness I dont feel like Im ever going to get a gf I'm ugly as fuck and I have social anxiety. I wish I could have a lot of friends, go out, socialize, HAVE A GIRLFRIEND. Girls only care about looks and thats why Im just so fucked. I feel depressed, alone, and confused everyone my age has someone to feel affection with. I'm just so sad. Life is not fair and I'm really sad "
"Why I will commit suicide in less than 30days.Many people asked me for the reason why I will commit suicide. It is a pretty long story with way to much information, would be worth making a book out of it. Haha. Anyways.. I decided to only post a part of the whole text so that you'll get the general idea of what is happening right now. This small part might seem a bit dumb to commit suicide for... I'll see maybe I'll post the whole version of it. Anyways here it is.


(...) Fast forward to me now 21 years old. Got a girlfriend and we are now in a committed relationship, she knows about my parents and she knows that I was suicidal... but what she doesn't know is that I am still suicidal. Last year I ran from my parents place to live at her place, got some therapy, had to stop taking therapy because my parents couldn't pay for it (and I don't work because I'm a full time studen), my parents made me feel like trash telling me that my depression is ""fake drama"", my parents manipulated me to go back to them (which lasted 2 months) and I got my driver's license. After I got the license I left them again and went to my girlfriend for good.

Now, brace yourselves. I got money from the government so that I can live alone. 12'000$ in total, 7500$ came into my banc account after summer vacation. My parents manipulated me into giving them 5000$ (don't ask my how they did it or why I did, I literally can't explain)... they claimed that the money was their money because they work hard and that this money comes from their paid taxes blablabla. They also defended their points by saying that with that money I had to pay my driver's license expenses (they promised me that they would pay, who would've thought that they'd take money that the government gave me to kinda survive), my ""fake drama"" and pay some of the expenses at home (gas, water, electricity and even food that I wasn't even eating). 

Now it's been nearly 3 months I've moved into an appartement with my girlfriend. One day we had a talk, she started crying and told me that she couldn't go on paying for everything, that she couldn't go on taking care of me ""like I'm your mom!"" (This one seriously hit me). I just sat there next to her, not even looking at her, and thinking ""Why do things always end up like that? Why am I such a burden to her?""

I have been looking for a job since August 2019. Still haven't found one, I made some money here and there but it is not enough. So, my girlfriend said ""If by the 1st of February you still haven't signed any contract, you will go back to your parents. I cannot go on like this."" (Oh yeah btw, in this case she will also break up with me.)

For me the conclusion is easy, this time there is no roundabout. If I can't find a job it's over for me too. I don't want to continue living being a burden for people and especially my girlfriend. I CANNOT go back living with my parents, this would be the greatest psychological damage ever done to me. They'd manipulate and force me to go to church with then and I would for sure NEVER see my girlfriend again. I can't, I can't, I can't go back to my parents this would be mental suicide. I'm in a position in which no one can help me without causing any damage to anyone be it emotionally, physically or financially.

So, after struggling and struggling and struggling for months to find a job, I almost lost hope. 

On December 24th I had this thought of committing suicide again. I had a lot of time to think through it... waged all my possibilities.... and after realizing that there might be the end in front of me, I just began to feel extremely relieved. I have been waiting to die and cease to exist since I was 9 years old, I guess at least that wish will come through."

"Cant see the point of talking to other peopleHere is the thing I dont get. People say 'call this number' or 'let me know if you want to talk'.

and then what. Unloading my problems on other people wont change anything. Talking to a stranger wont help my financial or relationship issues. Talking to friends or family wont help, they all have enough shit in their lives, without me adding the pile.

Why would I do that to other people. load all my crap on them? They cant change it, and then have them looking at me with pity? feeling sorry for me. Yeah, just what I need.

Fuck that. would rather just pull the pin, people will be sad for a few days but they will move on. All I need now is the courage, probably cant even do that..."
"I really want to dieI'm 18 and I really want to commit suicide but im too afraid of the pain. I'm usually quite good at coping with suicidal thoughts but it's getting very overwhelming, to the point if someone had a gun against my head I would beg them to shoot me. I really don't want to live anymore."

"One last chanceI'm sorry for ranting so randomly, but I'm just laying in my bed looking at the ceiling and this is killing me. 
 
Basically, I've decided to give myself one last chance before letting myself go and finally CTB. 
 
For a good while, people have started following my content and liking what I'm doing. I've gotten a bit of exposure and I'm working on one huge project... 
 
I just want to succeed. I want to live my life knowing I can live thanks to my work, to what I love and work hard for. To be honest, I'm scared. I'm terrified... What if it fails? 
 
To be honest, I think about dying every single day. Somehow, my project and my work are what keep me going. However, if I really end up failing and being unable to live off my passion... I'm ending it. I'm tired of being nothing, when people I know can get whatever they want by snapping their fingers. I'm so tired of this all. 
 
Sorry for the rant. "

"My ex told me part of the reason he stopped loving me is because Iâm transIâve never hated myself or wanted to kill myself as badly as I do right now. Iâm absolutely crushed. I donât even know how to put into words what Iâm feeling. He told me he would love me forever and wanted to marry me, and that me being trans didnât matter to him. But he also really wants kids and obviously that canât happen with me.

I think Iâm going to kill myself. I donât know how I can ever trust anyone again who says that they donât mind me being trans or that they can see a life with me. Iâm heartbroken but I have a bottle of vodka and a pack of Valium so maybe Iâll be okay.

"I feel like sometimes it must just happen.I feel like no matter how many hotlines are set up, some people will just slip through all of it and eventually kill themselves, if not now then later. I might at least just be talking about myself, but that's still what I think.

Some people go on and on, either no one else notices the warning signs or if they do, they either don't say anything and those who did get pushed away, which is what I kept doing. Even though I've always felt like my whole family and everyone I've known knows I have nothing to offer, that I'm a huge dumb ass and just overall a huge joke. When couple of teachers did reach out I just declined. A couple of old friends tried to reach out and again I declined. I'm too embarrassed to contact any of them again because then we would have to talk about how we are and what we've been doing. They would say they are at university and have partners or whatever and the only honest answer I could give about myself is that I kept dropping out of school and I constantly think about killing myself. That's the only thing that goes through my head. I have no skills, I'm useless at finding jobs and my only hobbies seem to be hating myself and feeling sorry for myself.

The end."

A bit of info: 

I'm 19

I never had a drivers license or a job because my parents don't think it's good idea right now.

I been asking for OT (for an other disability) and  other things for like two years and they are still ""working on it.""

I never had friends or been on a date.

I had leave school for a while and I'm getting my GED.

I will go to college if I live long enough.

Just going out or being around people has NEVER helped me make friends.

I went to Girl Scouts for seven years.

I want to learn to talk to people, like at all.

I am bit psychotic.

"17 yo who's contemplatingWhy am I sad. I want to be loved. I have no friends that truly care if I'm okay or not. I have family, I know they care, but I still can't get the thought out of my head. I. WANNA. DIE. I gave my heart to this one person and it's like they took it for granted. Why me? God please tell me why. I've tried living, everyone looks at me and sees a happy person. All I see is a waste of space. I just wish I could give my life to someone who really wants to live. You know?Â  It's okay to say all this shit to Trey because he doesn't care. Right? Well maybe if someone actually took the time to get to know me, then I wouldn't feel like this. Why is it so easy to hide emotions. Why can't I just express them. Am I afraid of getting judged? Yeah. Am I afraid that I'll truly know no one cares? Yeah, I am. Everyone says you're loved why would you wanna do that. The fact is we are not. Who loves you? No one. If you were to die tommorow, people will care, for a little while at least. And then what life's goes on. Our lives in this stupid ass universe have no purpose. They are microscopic specs. The odds that you are one of the few who get remembered. Tiny. And if so what for a hundred years, this shit is pointless."
"This is really, really long. I started typing and just kind of exploded.(First off, no hard feelings if you take one look at this and go ""nope, too long."" I don't want anyone to feel obligated, I am NOT at immediate threat, as the first paragraph will indicate)

I honestly don't know how much longer I can take this. I've had suicidal episodes before, but I never got close to the edge because thinking of the pain I'd cause those around me was too much. But now I'm getting to the point where that matters less to me than my own pain. Right now the only thing holding me back is my dog. She loves me, waits for me by the door until I get home every day, and never leaves my side once I'm home. Everyone else in my life, while they might never agree with or forgive my suicide, I could at least give an explanation why. But I cannot leave my dog wondering where I've disappeared to for the rest of her life. If she wasn't here, though, or if something happened to her? I wouldn't be writing this up right now.

I have a shitty part time job that I can't stand that only gives me enough hours to keep my head above water paying off my share of rent and student loans for a fucking worthless degree in philosophy that I was an idiot to get. I've been searching for a fulltime (or a supplemental part time) job for the 2 years since college ended, with no luck. I'm applying to everything I'm even partially qualified for. The best I've gotten was a group interview. None of the other places have even called me back. I've tried joining the Americorps and the Coast Guard, neither were interested in me. This leaves me still stuck living at home, in a rural area, without a car, which severely limits employment and social opportunities.

Well it used to be home. Back in April, my mother decided she was sick of my dad, so she and my sister found a small house and moved out. My dad said if I could convince one of my friends to move in, we could stay at that house. So I did, but after she moved in, he changed his mind and decided to move to a smaller place after all. So now I live in a 2 bedroom house, and since my friend can afford more rent than I can, neither of the two rooms are mine. I sleep on a futon out in the living room/kitchen area. This makes being depressed fucking wonderful, having no privacy to cry or blast music unless I go down to the river and hope nobody's there.

Plus, without my mom or sister around, I don't have anyone to relate to or talk to. They live in the same town, only 5 minutes drive from me, but I never see them anymore. My dad's not an asshole, he just doesn't get the whole ""being a father/husband"" thing. The only time he ever really talks to me is when he wants me to do something. My roommate isn't really a close friend. We make smalltalk about video games and movies, but she couldn't care less about my issues, not enough to even ask me what's wrong when I'm obviously on the brink. She's too busy having her boyfriend over every single night.

I've given up hope on getting a relationship myself. I don't understand how to talk to people I don't already know. I just can't do it. What the fuck do you talk about? Every girl that I do manage to get into a conversation is, without fail in a relationship. Even the ones I'm not attracted to. It's a statistical anomaly, but it's true. What makes it worse is that I always hear the same thing from my female friends. ""You're fun to talk to and you're pretty decent looking. Someone's bound to snatch you up eventually."" But words don't mean a whole lot. I could deal with being alone with my escapism, if not for being forced to listen to my roommate and her boyfriend every night. They try to be quiet, but it's a small house. And to be completely honest, the sex-sounds don't bother me half as much as hearing whispers and soft laughter at midnight, and knowing I'm never going to have anyone to talk to me like that.

I can't remember the last fucking time I've had a hug, and that's all I want right now. What I really want is one from somebody who is hugging me just because they're happy to see me, but at this point I'd even settle for a pity one. Just someone in my life who notices how much I'm hurting and actually gives a shit.

The worst part is this fucking curse that's been following me for years. I just never get the chance to be happy with life. Every time I get my hopes up for something that looks like it will turn out well, or every time things start going well for me, it's just a trick so that life can kick me in the teeth while my guard is down. Examples, because without them, I know all I'm going to get is ""no, no, that's just how you're *perceiving* things!"" 

1. Perfect full-time job opens up within walking distance of my house. I send in a resume, and mention that I applied to a friend. She tells me she's best friends with the manager of the place, and will talk to her to put in a good word for me. Calls me back the next day saying her friend the manager was interested in me and would be giving me a call soon for an interview. Then nothing. Finally I find out that shortly afterward, one of the manager's OTHER friends applied for the job herself and got it instantly.

2. Female friend from high school gets back in touch with me, wanting to get together and hang out. We end up talking and spending time together CONSTANTLY over the next week. They were my happiest days in recent memory, the only time I can think of where I enjoyed living instead of just using some form of escapism to keep me less depressed. She, normally a less-than-happy person, was feeling the same. She's in a relationship, but that it's ""on a break"" and mentions regularly how unhappy it's getting. Despite my intentions not to fall for her, and (assumedly) hers not to fall for me, chemistry kept building until it got to the point where we had to talk about it. She admitted that yes, it was the happiest she'd been for a long time, there was definite chemistry, and she caught herself intentionally flirting with me at times... But that she really wanted to make her unhappy relationship work, and the only way to do that was to stop talking and spending time with me, despite it making both of us happier than ever. Sorry, that's it, your newfound happiness has just been whisked away. Hope you enjoyed it while it lasted.

These are just the two latest in a long, unbroken pattern of me getting my hopes up about something and dashed on the rocks. For every rung I climb up the ladder, I slip down two. I feel like I'm being trained pavlov-style to duck and cringe whenever things start looking up, because it *always ends this way*. I never make any sort of progress in life that sticks. I'm in the same fucking spot I was in two years ago, only older and with less chances. I just want a job where I can support myself, or someone in my life who really cares about me, or some form of creative hobby that I enjoy and am good at. I just want some form of long-term enjoyment or self-esteem in life that doesn't come from fiction and video games, which is the only way I can really be happy anymore.

"When things are good I have suicidal ideation or am too angry to notice, but now EVERYTHING has gone wrong.I'm Canadian and my country's leader set up an emergency fund for a bunch of people until we get our jobs back. I watch everyone else get it, but mine never came in. I just dont get money I get. I've been cut off of suboxone even though I was stable and drug free, and I was taken off benzos, which ends in psychosis, violent outbursts at people who are ""out to get me"".

I've been a drain on my family financially and emotionally.

Everyone tells suicidal people that it's all in their head, but I have the bank statements and familial drama based around my drug use (because who actually believes someone when they say they quit heroin). I could list out other ways in which I hurt the people I love, but we'd be here all day.

So here I am. Dopesick, selling possessions just to fucking eat, hurting everyone around me and too lazy to help myself in any way on account of my normal baseline depression and shit attitude, let alone this mess. So why bother sitting around feeling pain, emotionally and now physically (withdrawal hurts, a lot). Why?

But the urges are at their strongest now and I no longer want to resist. I am also gay, and I have never told anyone about it and I never will. Now that I have committed to the idea of killing myself, I can not back out as in my mind that would mean I am weak and afraid of death. My parents... I don't even now what to say. Both my mother and father are the greatest people I have ever met and they deserved so much better than having me as a child. Please move on from my death and forget about me and live out the rest of your lives. They deserve so much and I fail to give them anything meaningful. I am still so young and stupid and hopefully someone stops me before I attempt it but if no one does there is a good chance I will be dead by this time next week.

"There's nothing I want to do with my life anymore. The only thing that makes me happy is friendship, but I've had to give up on that. I feel alone and life is pointless.Hey, reddit.

I don't expect anyone to be able to help me, but I thought I'd at least give it a try. Sorry for the length of this, but I tend to be easily misunderstood, so I wanted to try to avoid that. (There is a summary at the end if needed.)

I've never been able to connect with people in any meaningful way. I have Asperger's Syndrome (I know, I know, who on the internet *doesn't* these days? I was diagnosed last year.) - but unlike some Aspies I know of, I deeply craved personal relationships, rather than preferring to be left alone most of the time. I'm actually able to come off as normal-ish, merely shy/quiet (though perhaps somewhat eccentric). But when I make that attempt, I merely form ""friendships"" based around a false exterior, which I've learned are worthless. But when I just be myself, I don't make friends at all.

I've wanted to kill myself for almost as long as I can remember. I started feeling suicidal in 2002, when I was 14. In 2007, I decided that I would kill myself in 1 year if I couldn't go at least 1 straight week of wanting to be alive. That way, no one could say it was a hasty, stupid decision. 2008 came, and I almost went through with it, but I didn't because someone I was trying to make friends with sent me a message on MySpace, and I thought maybe there was a chance we might become friends (we didn't). My mom found out about my intention and I ended up hospitalized. Since then, I've felt too bad for my mom to go through with it, but I can't keep living just for that reason.

I have a very narrow range of interests: I enjoy listening to music and singing, and creative works (such as music creation, photography and videography, and writing). (I used to enjoy web design and programming, but that interest has faded.) These are the only things that make me happy for any lasting amount of time. But that all seems insignificant a lot of times, and sometimes I just don't feel like it. The only other thing that makes me truly happy and want to live is when I feel hope about a friendship or a relationship. I've never had a ""best friend"" or a boyfriend (I'm gay), but when a friendship seemed to be heading in that direction, the hope was enough. I've never wanted much out of life other than personal connection. I'm not interested in the typical goals people have for life, like college, career, etc. I wouldn't care that much if I became homeless. Stuff like that has just never been important to me for some reason.

After being burned too many times to handle, I have decided to stop seeking personal relationships. I know it sounds like, ""Well there's your problem right there; you gave up!"", but I did it for a good reason. I have very literally *never* succeeded in having a significant personal friendship (in real life). Every new failure piles on the weight of all my past failures. When I get my hopes up and things fail yet again, it is absolutely too much to handle. I don't want to go through that anymore. I don't think I could do that again and come out of it alive. I have some sort of attachment issue that causes me to like people way more than they like me. Every person I like is the most important person in the world. So I am actively avoiding personal relationships now.

I thought my decision to stop needing other people to complete me would be the best thing for me. It took a fair amount of work to start self-validating instead of looking to others for validation, but I did it. Unfortunately, even though I continue to do it, the effect didn't last, and I've started feeling overwhelmingly depressed and lonely again. So, fuck. I don't know what to do anymore. I seriously have no clue. I really think there is no answer here. I can't want people, I can't not want people... I can't just outright ignore it because there's not much else I want out of life... The only reason I'm still alive is because I just never quite had the nerve to go through with suicide, but my 21st birthday is coming up in a few weeks, and once I get some alcohol in my system I think I'll finally be able to go through with it. Even though I am posting here, I really do want to kill myself; I've wanted to do it for so long it's practically a life aspiration at this point. I'm really just posting here just in case someone comes up with something I hadn't thought of.

Other notes: I tried therapy and psychotherapy for about a year, but I don't think it really helped. I also tried anti-depressants, but they didn't have a noticeable effect, even when I tried overdosing slightly. I tried exercising regularly, but it only helped a little bit, and I wouldn't call the mood ""happy""... I still felt like crap overall about my life, but there was a bit of a temporary ""giddiness"" (not giddiness, but I lack a better word) where I just didn't care. It caused me to do stupid things without caring about the consequences, and basically be a totally different person that I didn't like. There was also the stress of having the weird chemical ""happy""-like feeling whilst still hating my life because nothing had actually changed, two conflicting feelings. It makes me content in the moment, but it doesn't motivate me to do anything with life long-term. I guess the one thing I haven't tried is diet, but that's because I don't have the money to buy my own food (nor do I know what to eat). Also, I'm wary of just ""hacking"" my brain to feel happy without actually changing anything in my life, after the experience with ""giddiness"" that I didn't like.

Lastly - and hopefully this goes without saying - but please don't reply with a harsh tone or insensitivity, as I have found that it doesn't help me at all; rather, it makes me interpret the message as a personal attack rather than absorb any advice contained therein. If you want to say ""Get over it"", ""Man up"", or tell me I should be grateful because there are Ethiopian children who would love to have my warm bed, please understand that that won't be helpful.

tl;dr= I've never been able to connect with people in any meaningful way, and it's unlikely I ever will, so I have stopped trying. However, there's nothing else I really care about in life. I'm not motivated in the typical areas that other people are, such as college, career, etc. My range of interests is too narrow to suffice. I've tried therapy, anti-depressants, and exercise, and although I don't currently have the means to try a special diet, I don't think diet will work, due to my experience with exercise."

The more I think this actually starts making more sense because he also does lot of drugs and drinks alcohol a lot, maybe he is trying to hide his feeling because he is too scared to come out of the closet..

Also he doesn't know that I know about his secret.

"I feel like an emotional vampire.I am not able to do basic tasks like care for myself. There are always giant knots in my hair and I'm actually too embarrassed to say the last time I showered. My teeth are pretty terrible because I can't handle that either. It is really my teeth that both me the most since I can't grow new ones. I've had one root canal already and I know I need more. They hurt me quite often.

Somehow, I am in a relationship. It is nice, but my lack of taking care of myself and my constant need for attention and validation is taking its toll. I'm not sure he loves me anymore. I go to college and he works. I'm supposed to clean and I don't. I don't pay rent since I have no income, I just mooch. I get frustrated and upset when he reminds me or talks to me about my lack of cleaning the house because I am deeply embarrassed. I know I should not.

It is his ultimate trump card in an argument, but I don't think it is entirely unfair. I'm sure that influences how he reacts to me or whatever.

I had been doing really well in college, but I feel like I just got lucky. I would get A's on chemistry finals because the online teacher passed away, get C's curved up to A's in Organic Chemistry. I recently transfer from a community/state college to a university and I feel I've completely bombed this semester. And I'm mooching off my parents too because they're paying for my college. 

I was looking to go to PA school, but it is so competitive and they don't accept grade replacement, that this fuck up may actually put me entirely out of the running for it. Yet I'm sure no matter what career path I end up in, I will quickly learn to detest it.

The most pathetic part is I'm 24 and only on my 3rd year of undergrad. Most of my classmates are 18 with nearly the same amount of credits from AP classes. Part of the reason I'm behind is from working and going to school part-time, but a lot of it is simply down to my indecisiveness and low tolerance for stress.

I just want to run away from my problems because I feel like the outcomes have narrowed to the point that I will be miserable with any. I'm so scared I'm just an emotional toxic manipulator or, as things get worse and the consequences of my laziness catch up with me, I will be.

I am being treated for ADHD, but the pharmacy never has my medicine in stock and since it is a controlled substance they can't get it shipped from another pharmacy. They can't even hold on to my prescription until it gets in. I should just check other pharmacies, but I just return back to the same one three times and then give up because I lost the prescription.

I'm considering suicide, but I'm also a coward. I would love to just leave the car running in the garage and go to sleep and never wake up, but I fear that would also harm the dog and cats I leave behind. On the other hand, I feel like I'm just thinking about suicide as a tactic to manipulate others, so I don't want to tell anyone about because then I'll just be manipulating them to feel sorry for me.

I know other people have is worse, but I just feel so incompatible with life."

But my friends don't know. They know I had to go to the doctors to get hormones checked for the hair (which didn't help with anything), but they don't know how bad it is. They don't know that it's worse than every guy I've ever met, they don't know that I'm developing chest hair and stomach hair. I hide everything. I only wear hoodies and jeans. I never wear anything I like because of the hair. If they ever find out about how hairy I am, they wouldn't want to be friends with me anymore. 

My family knows about the hair, but they insist I'm fine. My mother insists that there's nothing wrong with me. It's like she doesn't have eyes. Can't she fucking see that my leg hair is worse than my own brother's? Or worse than my father's?

Not angry, he literally just wanted to go to bed, which somehow made it worse to me. Every time I need help, people just leave. Iâm in college and doing well in my classes. Iâm afraid to tell my mom how Iâve been feeling because I know sheâll be disappointed that I have to stop school and take care of my mental health... again... in the same month this happened before years ago when I tried to kill myself. But I canât kill myself now because sheâll be even more disappointed. Iâm scared Iâm going to hurt myself so Iâm locking myself in a room. I canât go to bed with my boyfriend because being next to him makes me so sad knowing heâll never care about me in the way I need him to. He will never see the pain Iâm in, even when I tell him. And now I cut myself again. Relapse after years of not doing it. My mind keeps flashing ways I could do it. And Iâm so scared. People will leave me, if they knew what Iâm feeling and going through- I know it. Doesnât matter what I stuck with my boyfriend through, I know heâll leave if I told him. Iâm never enough. I spend my energy on other people and no one is here when I need it. But I guess I also pushed all my good friends away years ago because I knew they deserved better than me. I distanced so they could make better friends with people I knew they wanted to with, and sure enough- they are all much better friends than we ever were and seem so much happier. And Iâm happy for them, but now Iâm left with no one. Whenever I let the mask drop, itâs always the same. No one takes me seriously until I try to kill myself. I know that canât be the way it actually is, but it sure feels like that. And tonight, Iâm more afraid than ever. I stared at myself for half an hour in the mirror trying to see anything other than a shell. I canât."
"My mom used my savings money to buy alcohol and hangout with her friends I'm heartbroken ,my 6 year old brother really to play animal crossing and I've planing to buy Nintendo switch lite for him

"Itâs backI went home for thanksgiving. Iâm back at college. The thoughts have come back full force. I feel so isolated and alone and even though I know itâs impossible that nobody else feels this way.. I feel completely alone, 

Iâm so overwhelmed. I donât want the thoughts to get to the point where I have another attempt. I donât even think the next time will be an attempt, I know what I need to do to guarantee Iâm dead. I hate this depression. I hate this suffering."

"My friend is suicidal - How do I help her through this?I have posted this on r/depression aswell, but I want to get as much feedback as possible.

So, a little backstory: We have been friends for about 8 years and we can talk about almost anything, if not anything. She has always had a tendency of self-harming, like in her pre-teen years she would cut herself with scalpels. Two years ago, her sister passed away and it destroyed her. Unfortunatelly, we lost touch during this time so I couldn't be there for her, but we've recently found our way back to each other.

She has told me she's had a relapse of hurting herself, cutting herself, punching walls, even planning her own suicide (setting a date), but couldn't go through with it because, according to her, she wouldn't know how to. We can talk about these things, but I want to know more of how I can comfort her? Have you gone through something similar? How did you cope with it? What did you find comforting? How can I help her through this?

It's not as severe today, but I fear that she might fall back into the vicious circle of grief that is depression.

I have been suicidal myself, so I want to believe that I know how to confront and converse about these kinds of things, but external input can only be a good thing.

I appreciate all feedback I can get on this."

"I am done with being a damn screw up.Basically, the title says it all.

Today I have had one of the worst days in my life. 

Tonight, I have already started cutting myself, and don't plan to stop soon.

I am just a good for nothing, looked over, piece of shit. I am tired of being screwed over on EVERYTHING.

No, It's not gonna get better so don't try and say that.

It's only going down hill but, one problem, there's no more down.

Today I was sitting at a park and I just wanted to drive my truck in the lake I was looking at. I was feeling that bad and still am.

The cause of these feelings is basically an array of being alone, getting a chance at anything and failing, family problems, and shut out of everything.


I am done with this life. I want to be gone, but I don't have the will to do it myself."
"I may do it tonight.I feel like such a burden on everyone in my life. My girlfriend and I broke up and I thought it was the right thing to do but now she is miserable. I try to be a good friend and I fail all the time. The number of friends I have is slowly declining. I got really drunk this weekend and sent out annoying texts and Snapchats and Iâve had so much anxiety about it, even worse than usual which is bad. I hate the way I look and the only girl I am romantically interested in is in a long-term relationship that doesnât seem like it will ever end.

Iâve been thinking about it for a while.

I feel like donât really have a lot to live for even though I know I do.

If no one in my life reaches out to me to spend time or talk or anything tonight I will probably do it. I already have a plan. Iâm not going to ask anyone for help because I already feel like so much of a burden.

I just feel like iâve lost all my hope"
"I have an experimental plan for all the girl craving phycos on reddit So. You become great friends with the target, make sure the friendship is completely mutual, then set a fake/real thing up, where you are completely about to commit suicide, and if your target doesn't stop you at all, besides texting "" That's selfish ngl"" then you know you failed and how you have nothing to live for anyways. But if she does convince you to stop, then you know the Friend is great, and if you get a hug outta it, you can kiss them and if things get awkward, just blame it on how you were boutta die and they were the only ones to stop you.

This may take months, and suicide has to already be a viable option. Dont do suicide if you's not a phyco like i stated in the title."

"Reddit isn't a community, it's more like a family We have fun together. We laugh, joke and support anyone who needs us. Like every family, we fight and then make up. There might be some bad seeds but every family has bad seeds, so we just ignore them and keep on vibing with each other. We take lonely, depressed people and force them to vibe with us and in the process help them rediscover their will to live. We live in a harmony that no one except us can understand and love.

I love every single one of you. The entirety of Reddit loves every single one of you. If that isn't enough to keep y'all going, nothing ever will be.

"How empty can you get before being empty is all you know?I feel nothing. No fear, no regret, no guilt. I feel empty. I've always been open with my husband about how I'm feeling, whether it be suicidal, or just down in general. But I can't bring myself to tell him that I'm just so empty. I have thought, ""I need to say this"", but don't have the words to say. My mind is blank. And I don't want to live like this. I finally took the leap and got therapy and a psychiatrist, but I feel worse. I have therapy in 6 hours and I'm just laying in bed, trying to figure out the lies I will have to say just to crawl back into bed and feel empty alone. I'm tired of the nightmares, the emptiness, and most importantly, life. I have no passion, no hobbies, no desire to do anything, and I am better off dead."

"Reminder: You're still here, which means you're doing something right in my book.Life is difficult: it doesn't give much of anything freely -- of the things it does give freely, few of them are worth having.

I know life isn't fair and I'm sorry it isn't, but when you feel like you're worthless and you're doing nothing right... remember: you're still alive.

I don't care what excuse you give as to why you still being here isn't an accomplishment, I don't care what you say as to why your life isn't valuable, you're wrong.

You haven't ""logged off"", you haven't ""quit"", you're still trying even if it is by default -- and that's a win in my book.

If you need someone to talk to: PM me, or let someone on this sub know, or find a different sub that will help.

You're still here, which means you still have the potential to turn everything around and make life worth living.

"I just don't have anyone to talk to and I feel horribleI can barely write. Sorry.

I feel pathetic everytime I try to seek help because I alaways get nervous enough to make it sound less worrying than it should. People get uncomfortable and leave, or they get afraid or worried, which leads to them trying to help me while I feel like it's useless to keep trying to explain what's happening.

It destroys me slowly. Trying to say how sometimes the world loses its colours and I feel like it's useless to do anything. Like I'm getting closer to death. My legs struggle to keep me upright and I start to lose my bearings.

All while I hold a fake smile to tell people that I'm fine, so they don't... Well... Leave... Or treat me like the weird, sad, pitiful kid, which happens a lot.

All of this makes me feel like it's even more worthless to try and continue to fight back these feelings anyway...

My mom got scared... My dad doesn't care... My friends don't know what to do, and I don't want them to treat me overly nicely, or worry them to something that maybe resonates inside of them...

So

Maybe I'm sinking alone

But what difference would it make if I did...

Sure, people would be horribly sad
I would too

But it feels like the void that's pulling me is stronger than anything I can come up with... My friends are not to blame for not knowing what to do... But I just end up feeling alone.

My therapists feel like they also don't know what to do

So here I am

"I feel like no one believes how serious your mental health is unless youâre successful in your suicide attempt..Even if you fail, some people will claim that youâre attention seeking or being over dramatic.

I donât fucking get it. Itâs only when someone is officially 100% GONE that people want to start caring about mental health.

But then I think to myself.. itâs my life, not theirs. Why SHOULD they worry about me anyways? Itâs not their job to make sure Iâm happy or sane.


I hope thereâs a better place out there after all this."

"Iâm an idiot I accidentally made fun of a suicidal friendI donât know what to do and I donât know if this is the right place to post this.. 
Iâm sorry if itâs wrong and I can delete it if it shouldnât be here 

I have this friend that is currently living in a country very far from his family and also in a state that is a bit further from the city. Heâs currently working and saving up money. Due to covid and the whole lockdown heâs been quite secluded and every now and then we would chat very little about the whole thing. 
(I guess Iâm just a straight idiot for not asking him more about it, checking how heâs doing more regularly.. Iâm just realizing Iâve been too selfish for not doing that)
Anyways today he told me he canât leave the town heâs in to visit someone he knows in a city kinda nearby bc lockdown and his birthday is this weekend so he was very sad and mad about it, and that his boss told him that if he finds out that he goes to the city, he will get fired. So I told him that his boss kinda has a point bc is quite dangerous to leave to a city that is in high risk of getting infected. And he said that it isnât fair because itâs not illegal to go. And somewhere around there he said âwell the amount of suicide rates is the same or more than the amount of deaths by covidâ and I replied âdonât start speaking like a boomer or Iâll kick your assâ 
Then he said âwell only if you knew how it feels to be so secluded and not having anyone but you will not know because youâre with your family and pets and you might be bored but at least you have people with youâ 
And I explained to him that I referred to what he said about comparing situations that itâs not the same, and I totally not know what heâs going through, but I know heâs mad about whatâs happening but thereâs not much we can do about it. 
And then he said âIâm trying to tell you Iâm having suicidal thoughts and your answer was calling me boomer. Let it be knownâ 
After that I was shocked because I didnât read that in his message, I got it from the other side: the people that think that covid is not that bad, etc etc and I explained that to him and told him Iâm sorry I didnât get what he said the first time and that I would never make fun of someone going through suicidal thoughts (except of myself) and I was very sorry and if I could do something to help him and told him some ideas to maybe FaceTime (even though where he lives thereâs no wifi) and he hasnât replied. 
I hate myself for not being careful enough, some parts of myself tell me it wasnât my fault because he redacted the idea in a different way to what he meant.. and other part of me thinks Iâm just a straight dumbass for not asking him more about how he feels or whatâs heâs living. 
Before those texts I thought he was doing good because he found a girlfriend in the city nearby and maybe things were going better? But apparently arenât and Iâm afraid I lost his friendship and I donât like that I donât know how to help him. And I hate that heâs feeling that way. Suicidal thoughts are the worst. I freaking hate them. 
Iâm having so much anxiety and I feel like Iâm close to a panic attack
Also I donât know if this is relevant but I have those thoughts every now and then and in my chest I feel like a massive pressure when thinking about this topic but also now itâs intensified because my friend is going through that and I donât want that for him"
"Sex is the only thing motivating me to stay aliveI'm a very sexual person and ironically i never hookup with any girls despite being very attractive and I'm not okay w that anymore.

Life sucks but the only thing that makes me even remotely happy is laying nxt to a woman. So I'm literally gonna attempt to fuck the depression out of me. It sounds ridiculous but I think it might work. I'm just gonna have freaky fucked up insane sex in Hope's that it gives me something to look forward to"

"true story okay so we all know by now some people are just absolutley terrible human beings most times females and all in the name of ""feminism"" or""women empowerment"" anyway a friend cheated boyfriend multiple times then when the dude she was dating found out she actually had the audacity to say it was his and he should apologize for walking in on them long story short the guy dumped her this girl now came ranting to me about how he was a misogonystic pig who was infringing on her women rights by not allowing her sleep with other men sometimes iam actually ashamed to be of the female gender anyway thanks for coming to my ted talk"
"I hate talking about my problems but even when I want to, I'm scared to be honest.Don't like to talk to people IRL about my issues which is why I barely see psychiatrist anymore. Too anxious and avoidant to face or talk about problems but when I do feel like it, I'm still afraid.

I imagine being at doctor's. I don't know laws well enough. I'm scared to be committed or sent to jail or deemed a nut case, etc. I don't know if I can be 100% honest if I talk to them. I bet I have periods of intense honesty and other times will be a pathological liar.

Back to my worries about law and being committed... yeah should I tell them I fantasize about buying a gun and blowing my brains out as I sit at home by myself, numb and useless to society? Or overdosing on all these opiates I have? Or that I have urges to be a rapist even? Like I don't act on anything so that's ok right? I'd rather they give me the electric chair than commit me to mental ward forever or have me labelled as a loony to everyone I know and can't get a normal job or life ever anyways"

"There is one question I ask from myself: Do I want to be rather dead or alive?My answer to that question is that I rather want to be dead. So there is only one action I need to take and I then I've achieved death. I do not ask this question only right now while typing this post during some awful breakup or loss but for last 9 years consciously, unconciously, in every way I've been asking it. So I don't take suicide lightly. You seriously have to consider what you give up (are you willing to give up things you don't know yet - like possible new relationships, activities etc) and decide if you seriously rather be dead than alive. My answer has been that I want to be dead or better yet - I wish I never existed, so I think that's enough time to have made this decision.  That means I do not want ANYTHING anymore - to spend time in Internet anymore, eat, swim, talk, see, hear music, talk with my family, friends, work, study, worry, get older, fight with mental illness until old age and eventually die. For me everything is pointless. And long time I was embarrassed to call life 'pointless'  because it sounds too edgy and childish for a grownup I thought. I'm a grownup and should handle life like everyone else. But deepdown, it's pointless. For me, personally, I do not want it. I do not want to experience life. I do not want to have consciousness. I do not want happiness, excitement, sadness, or anything. I want to be non-existant."
"When you have people around you and yet you feel alone.Hello I'm here because I feel as if Im need of some help. (of course I  really don't want to have to need it, I want to take care of it on my own)  
Like many others I have had thought in my head that for some reason tell me I'm a worthless piece of shit and that I don't deserve anything. Of course the things that happen to me in my life involving 0. (family,friends and love life) just kinda justify the thoughts in my head. 
Iv always thought that I can never hurt myself because it's would only really be hurting the ppl I care about and that care about me but its been increasingly difficult to push all those thoughts back and I just want to end it to not have to feel  all this bullshit. 
I have friends but the majority live out of town now, I message them to talk sometime and sometimes get really down and ask them to talk because I just need a friend at the moment (they will answer sometimes but usually not). 
I talk to my family and they just say the samething(telling me im not worthless but not really giving me justification to why I'm not, I know they love me but I also know it's not enough)
Iv felt like this for so long now that I just don't want to involve other ppl anymore and feel like I would just be a burden  on everyone if I tried to do so.
And I know my life could be alot worse and that others lives are probably worse in someways but whenever I think of that I just feel guilt for feeling this way.
I feel so alone all the time I feel like I'm living in a world where all I want it to just not be alive anymore and I just feel trapped like I can't do anything."
"A Million Reasons Yay vs 1 Reason NayThe one thing that has kept me alive for many of the past years of my life is my family. Not in the way that the support they show has helped fight against my depression and better me as a human, but rather in that I cant hurt them by taking my life. I have accepted I want to die, I have for a long time now, and I have accepted that my death will most likely be at my hands, no matter when it happens. My mind is too far gone, and they all say it gets better in the future. Even if that is the case, even if in a few years I will find happiness, I truly don't care. Life is a game, and even if I am bound to win, I am sick of playing anyway. That's a large IF though. I don't care what happens in the future, its the path to get there that I really don't feel like traversing. I don't want to live. I have a million reasons why I don't want to live anymore, on why I want to die, to why I already know how I will do it. But there is one single thing keeping me from doing it, one single thing that has been the only counter to the decision causing internal debate that has existed within for years. My family. I cant stand the fact that I have a super caring family. I have fantastic parents and a sister, and we have grown up a pretty close-knit family. I cant get myself to hurt them, and it makes me hate them for it. I am jealous of those who have no family that care about them. Because then I could so easily just go through with my decision. Why do they have to care about me? Why do I have to care about the pain I would cause if I do as I wish? I occasionally daydream about terribly morbid and tragic stuff happening to my family so I could finally end my own life. It makes me feel awful that I would even wish something like that, and I tell myself I don't actually want something bad to happen to them like that, but sometimes I cant tell. I also so badly wish I could get terminal cancer, or some random incurable disease that kills me relatively quickly. Or I want some accident to happen that ends up killing me. I hope for tragic things to happen to me because then for the sake of my family, it wont be my own doing. I just feel stuck. I have long given up on living and working on my life and trying, but I also cant kill myself. I want to, it would be simple and I am so completely ready to, but I cant. So I am left ""living"" just to keep my family from experiencing unrelenting grief. What am I supposed to do?

Sometimes I get impulsive and almost do it. Almost go through with it. I have a short note already written out, but I truly don't really know what to say because I know that it will leave a million things unanswered for my family anyway. And I know no matter what, they wont understand. I hate it when I hear families grieving somebody's suicide say, ""Did they even think about the pain they would cause us?"" Uhhhh of fucking course we do. That's literally all I think about. Choosing suicide is not an easy decision by any means, rather its probably the most difficult decision a person could ever make. I, for example, know that I want to commit suicide. But guess what, I haven't yet. I've held it off for years, and you know why? Because I AM THINKNG ABOUT THE PAIN I WOULD CAUSE YOU. It is LITERALLY the only reason I am alive right now. I despise my selfishness, so I haven't let it win yet. But I know that I can never get you, or anybody, to ever understand what goes on in my head. I don't know the point of this post, I am sorta rambling some shit that has no meaning anyway. Please, someone just come murder me or something, so I can get what I want and my family wont think it was my own doing."
"If I want to eat, I would yes, i know my parents care for me but sometimes they get me a full bowl of noodles at 9 am without checking with me first and that is very filling and too early for me to eat

we have other smaller snacks like donuts, i would prefer to eat those instead but they say eating that big bowl of noodles is better as it's supposedly ""brunch"" time right nos"

We are at r/assistance thank you for your help with this one and all the other people you help. You do a great service here."
"The thought of killing myself gives me comfortKnowing that I wonât be here for much longer. That itâs a matter of if not when I commit suicide. The fact that when itâs done I wonât be in pain anymore. Knowing that thereâs nothing on the other side to worry about, no negativity, no pain, nothing. All of it comforts me. I canât wait to die. I think about killing myself everyday. Hopefully it wonât be that much longer."
How do I delete the memories of a specific person from my brain Donât need to see her face in my mind anymore. Nope donât need that.

"I just want to stop thinking foreverI feel so empty inside and I have no motivation to ever change. Iâm so worthless Iâm just waiting out the rest of my life until Iâm gone. Whatâs the point in living when you know things will never be the way you want them. There is no point. I havenât hurt myself in a long time but I wish I could go away. I am awful. I am sorry. 

I wonât do anything tonight but every week i get so worked up about life and I feel paralyzed. My heart and head hurt and it feels so bad. I hate myself so much fuck this awful world"

"I just wamted to thank all of youHello everyone, I just wanted to thank all of you.  From the age of 5-8 I was sexually assaulted by a female babysitter. In the end, her abuse caused internal lacerations, greatly affecting me physically and mentally.

I didn't have the courage to speak up until recently, and the rejection I recieved from my family after revealing,my secret was unbearable. I was told I should have enioyed it because I was a young male, by family members. They obviously have no understanding about child sexual abuse. It affected me in so many ways, it is so fucking sad, and I know children are still being abused, this really hurts me. 

This fall I was on the verge of killing myself, I didn'r tell family or friends that I was going to end it all. I planned to drive to a nearby major city and jump off of the highest parkade. I planned it for months, created my own will, and had money for my funeral, that is when Reddit stepped in.

I posted my story on Reddit, and a few kind souls suggested I go camping and gtfo of dodge, so I did.  During my adventure, I realized that none of this was my fault, and I can't blame others. That is what the weak and cowards do. I am moving on with my life, and recently enrolled in college. I am crying right now and would like to thank you all again. Dont let social stigmas define you, and speak up if you are a victim of sexual abuse, even if you are a male!!! THANK YOU REDDIT YOU SAVED MY LIFE"
"I can't leave my kids behind.I was on opiates for a long time due to an ongoing medical condition over 7 years. Well I've been ""healthy"" and addicted for the last 3 years. 

I burned everything I had last week and now the only thing keeping my gun out of my mouth is the thought of my kids. 

I feel fine around them. 

Then I'm alone and nothing matters. I just want it to go away. I want everything to stop. 

I wish I didn't have a family so I could end this without causing pain to anyone else. 

I can't tell anyone. What will they think of me? I wish I could just wander into the woods and never come out. "

"About to loose my job.My boss came up to me first thing this morning and told me to start looking for a new job.  I have been looking. It seems like all the jobs that are good for me require a higher degree than what I have.

I can't stand on my feet for more than an hour. I have cerebral hypotomia.  Look it up... too long to talk about.

In short I need a sit down job.

I'm screwed.

I don't have enough money to go back to school and live on.

I feel panic. I'm depressed. I feel like there is no way put of this."

I've heard the promises

I feel like I'm about to vomit and cry and I'm only going in because I have to keep the job. I should care more about getting paid but that's not even on my mind anymore. I guess I'm used to getting screwed on that end too.

If I lose my job, I probably lose my chance at TMS and any hope of any remission of this depression ever.

Like why am I still fighting? Why even drag this out?

Realistically I shouldn't be going into work because my means of suicide this round is bloody right there but,

"The Wild (Suicide Note)The Wild

In the wild, there is a system, a hierarchy. In the wild there are politics, there are economics, there are social groups, there are families, and there is a food chain. In the wild we can see that everything is divided in groups, there are states, counties and borders that should not be crossed. Every animal group has their own system or way of doing things, elephants for example have a matriarch system, there is a chief elephant that leads their herd, there are family groups composed of moms, dads, sons, daughters and even uncles. They have social groups within the herd. When a link between the elephants is broken or one of the elephant dies, the other elephants mourn  their lost or their break-up. We can also see systems in other animals like lions. Not that the DisneyÂ® movie âThe Lion Kingâ is entirely true, but there is some true to some of the behaviors seen in the movie. Like the alpha male being the king and the leader, this behavior is really seen in the wild. The females hunt and the male sits all day guarding the âhouseâ. These animals are intelligent enough to create hierarchies and to assign roles. There are multiple examples of systems in the wild, but what about humans, what about our systems, our politics, our economy, our social groups. How do we reflect the close to perfect systems that the âlowerâ species develop. There is a factor that limits our development process of successful systems. Betrayalâ¦ In the wild, it is very rare to see same species animals betray their own kin. But among humans this is a really dominant factor, in politics, in economy and other âeffective systemsâ that we've created. We see betrayal when a politician promises change, but delivers misery and poverty to his people. We see betrayal in economy when a person that makes (apparently) not enough money to survive this terrible life, steals from the poor to satisfy his own greedy and vicious needs. We see betrayal in our social development and social groups. Before we are born we could easily be betrayed by our mother who chose to abort because her life is a miserable piece of crap and a baby wont make it any better. But if you do get the chance to be born, you get betrayed on every single step of your life, no matter how much you learn about life and its evil ways, youâll get betrayed by the one you call brother, the one you call friend and sometimes even the one you donât call anything because you donât even know them. Thatâs how FUCKED UP this world is. You get betrayed when you fall in love, you get betrayed when you think out load, when you speak, when you dream, in fact when you do ANYTHING, you are sure to get betrayed. You may ask yourself, â why is this happening to me?â and trust me, eventually you'll realize that nothing in this god damned world is worth it. Nothing is worth it, not knowledge, not being popular or famous, not being rich, not being the pretties or cutest person in the world, NOTHING and I repeat NOTHING is worth it. Because as all the other animals in the wild all humans really need, other than food, sleep, and a well given bath, is love. Every animal no matter what the species is needs love. We all need a special someone. But just imagine how screwed up the world is that we prefer to betray our friends, family, and sometimes even ourselves to make someone elseâs life a living hell, and you know you've gone your way at some point in your life to make someone miserable. This is something we don't see in the wild because animals understand the commitment and the responsibility that comes with living in this world and enjoying your stay in this shit hole while it lasts. We also don't see this shitty behavior in the wild because animals don't have the mental capacity to hate, they don't have the mental capacity to betray or to backstab their friends. If there is one thing I've learned from life experiences is to not befriend anyone, just smile and wave, or just learn their names and call them by that because humans are so vain that they love listening to their own name (narcissistic sonâs of bitches that we are huh). So thats one of the things I've learned, but like I said this means nothing, absolutely nothing is worth anything in this nickel back piece of crap world. I know I may seem rude or just seem like an ass, but thats what you get when you go into the wild. You learn to survive and eat every single being that crosses your path. A few days ago I came up with the phrase âLetâs do it!â, what I really meant to say was lets not do anything and lets just sit here and do nothing until death proclaims our miserable bodies, because I feel like this life is less shitty when you just do nothing. Why because you canât hurt or get hurt, and people say that pain makes us growâ¦ Well guess what that is the biggest pile of bull shit I've ever heard. Human beings did not evolve for 8 million years to live in pain. We evolved because there were some basic necessities that we needed to take care of and that caused changes in the human body to adapt our physical nature to nature itself. What I really hate is when people say that love is not a relevant thingâ¦ Okayâ¦ Okayâ¦ Letâs see how you handle everyone rejecting you and not being able to love. Youâll go fucking nuts in less than a few hours, specially in this society where our emotions and our souls are driven by Facebook and twitter. To be a little more practical, start a Facebook profile, get tons of likes and then close your accountâ¦ You'll come back to the computer screen like a love searching moth in the dark. We are love whores, we need love, we need it so much that when your family abandons you, your friends become the filthiest assholes in the universe, and your dog doesnât want you to pet him, we turn to God for a loving handâ¦ Could you be a bit less stupid please, God loves you and he loves everyone but the kind of love that humans need is not the love of an invisible being that created the world and humans themselves. Humans need the word, and no im not talking about the bible. Im talking about the literal word âLoveâ. Why do I say thisâ¦ well growing up with a mom that worked all day and a step dad that had a love-hate relationship with me, sometimes all I needed was a word, a word used in the context of the famous phrase âI Love Youâ, and don't tell me that you don't like hearing those words together. I just wish I would have been given the opportunity to choose between a wealthy life and the love of a mother. I didn't really ever feel that so I don't know what love is. Ive been in multiple relationships, all of which failed miserably because I don't know how to love and my attitude is shit. A lot of people suffer from shitty attitude syndrome, which is basically being an asshole, and only enough some maleâs and femaleâs across the globe fall for this kind of behavior because they think its attractive, well its not and all the people who like these bad attitudes are stupid and should be put in a mental institution to get some serious treatments. But this attraction is not always our fault, because the fault is definitely in our stars, the fault is in out way of thinking about other people. For example, I used to think my stage manager for the traveling theatre group in college was cute, and I was filled with joy every time I saw her face or talked to her, but then came the betrayal, she liked my friend, and even though I wasn't completely satisfied with this I decided to pursue the dream of one day being given the chance to join her in a relationship. Even though she did not know and will probably never find out, this was something that bothered me and killed me inside. Ive always been the type of person that likes to listen so whenever I got the chance to talk to her I would listen to all the lovee dovee things that she had to say, in my mind I couldn't give three shits about what she thought about him, cause I a guy and Im straight, but In my face I would reply with the typical âMhhmâ which is not very intelligent if you're trying to get a girl to like you, but at some point along the way of liking her I started to see her interest in him getting very strong, to the point where friends would go out to eat and they wouldn't invite me. Which in case you don't know is a fucking big deal okay! But what was I to doâ¦? Nothing, nothing at all. I didn't have to do anything because I decided to quit the thought of ever existing and I decided to kill myself. This is not a suicide letter, itâs a cry for love. I really need someone to roam the Savannah with me, to show me the beautiful skies of Kenya. I need someone to help me fight for my life in the wild."
I donât want to move on with my lifeI have been isolating myself and getting pretty deep into a black hole of depression recently. Iâm supposed to graduate college in May but thereâs nothing that I want to live for. I do not have any skills or passions and no job or next step lined up. I donât want to burden anyone in my life by talking to them about this. I havenât seen my friends in a while. Iâm not close with my family. Everything hurts me so I just donât do anything or talk to anyone. I donât know what to do at this point. Iâve stopped drinking because I think thatâs when Iâm most likely to have the courage to kill myself. I also canât afford my medication so will have to be off of it until I get paid on Friday. Iâm trying to take care of myself and go outside. Iâm hurting so bad and Iâm not sure what else I can do at this point 
I'm unnistalling among us Every fucking time I'm an imposter there's a little nitch who doesn't like me for bullshit reasons so he lies to get me kicked out and  fuckin done with that shit

"I don't know if I should post this here, I think i just have to step outside of the world. Only thing that's gonna keep me here is not harming my family. A read will help a lot.I'm a 22 M, not from the US, don't know if I should post this. 
First I'll address the bad things I've done and tell my porn problems not to soften it,  I'll tell my life trauma after. 
I've commited sexual misconducts, whatever it is called I committed sexual crimes.When I was 18 in college freshman year I was like the cute kid that acted very childish and never acted  wrong to anybody but I was really sick in the mind without knowing,never did sum wrong before that. When I was a freshman in college I went to a party in a friends house, I started trying to kiss her, like I wanted to make up with her even being kinda friends,I was really drunk, dropping glasses with alcohol and shit, and she just avoided me and I guess she was like ""wtf is wrong with him"" and than i kept persisting and moments after she left to go other place I went there and waited for her to come off the bathroom and straight up locked her with me in the bathroom,she kissed me laughing and then left,after I peed in that bathroom i went to the dancing place and sat grabbing my head, and told her  did I bother you too much? I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, and she got that I was wrong and we kinda  hugged each other and it just got never spoken too much after, and my friends of that time just laughed at the situation, I guess they couldn't tell that I was sick. Sometimes that year  I kept insisting with girls to make up, it wasn't really bad to me to think of that in a flirty way because I was being mostly a jerk, not an absolute sick fuck like in that locking situation.But I couldnt control my ego I think or whatever it was, specially when drunk ur high. 

2 years after this when i was 20 I think I started to become absolutely sick, when I was working in a supermarket as a sales men I saw an adult women with a big butt and took a photo of her, I don't know why, but when I went home I deleted them thinking like wtf am I doing, and I remember when i was in 7th grade there was a week where me and my friends  used to do that with teachers, and my sister told me that time "" you're so dumb"" , and I stopped and always hated people that did that, even when high school friends came with pictures they had took from women on the subway and shit I was like, this is bad guys, because I had realized it years before and somehow I ended up doing that again.

 This same year I went to a party with a friend of mine and girlfriends, I made up with a classmate , and she made up with my friend and even her friends, we were  really drunk and she was more drunk than us, we started to make up and after I realizing she was buzzed I stopped, and we made up again  in the same party like 3 hours after that bc I thought she was better, and this might be the first moment when my absolutely misconstrued idea of sexual things I viewed in porn came off, we were dancing really close and I put her hand in my groin, not under clothes but in my groin, she took her hand off and like a minute after she just put my hands on her breast, we just made up and that's it, I don't think this was that bad bc we were all drunk and something was made to me too but still I hadn't realized I had absolutely no education about sexual behaviour at all. 

This same year, in a party in April I was trying to get to make up with this same girl because I had always liked her, it didn't work out and as usually she just played with me and made me feel bad just for fun. 
Then I just got mad and felt ashamed, and when I calmed I went to this girl I had found attractive and I knew she liked me since last year and nothing happened that year, we were talking, we agreed to go make up and went to a tent that was alone, we talked about things and we had a good time, if I tried to touch a boob or something she said no and I stopped, that's it, it felt awkward and didn't persist, i did try to make her stay  there because it was a nice moment but she left so we weren't discovered as it had been secret I guess, and like 2 hours after  I made up with this girl, friend of the girlfriend of a friend. I think I drank tequila shots before  to make myself bolder (extremely dangerous) and we started making up and 
I was way too persistent to go somewhere else to go a step beyond, I tried too much to touch her tho she had told me no more then one time, I put her hand in my groin too, second time I did that, I wasn't controlling myself even when there was people there trying to sleep or making up on their side too, I don't know if being alone before made me think that I was going to scare the other girl or I was just sober or I don't know but the second  time I was too persistent, she had to take my hands off her some times and after I just kinda realized, calmed myself or Idk, we kept making up and talking things until the morning, even when we woke up so  I didn't take it as a bad situation because we had kept kissing, but in general I acted terrible and at this point I just had stopped apologizing for the shit I did, and now that I woke up from all this shit I may know why I didn't worry anymore and I will tell about it, if someone really accepts to  read this because I know it will disgust most people and it doesn't get me mad or sum, it's obvious. We had each other in social media for all this time and it didn't seem that it was that bad bc this friend always told me I liked her, so I guessed it wasn't that bad, This year, 2 years after there were lots of people getting canceled on the me too movement, and I said to myself ""I will apologize to her after all this calms"" and that's where I hit a switch and say hell no, if I have to be exposed I'll accept it bc I'm not a coward, so I sent her a long text asking how she felt on the situation,that I deadass persisted too much and that I a was to desperate and I told her that I was having suicidal thoughts, that I live with an abusive brother and that I had been bullied at school, and as I was put thru so much violence I was scared that if I would've had a GF I would've been a jackass, and I was scared that I could explode in violence (none of this is a lie, I was just realizing my life had been an absolute shitload of trauma) . And well she told me that yeah I was too persistent and she had to take my hands off her, and she was in surprise of that message because she kinda didn't remember the situation, she told me that when she felt abused by men it was in other situations and she thought of the thing with me as a drunk party type thing, that she respected that I was admitting things and that I had to get help, and I thanked her really for listening to me, and she gave me help and advice , I couldn't be more thankful to her. 

When I apologized to her I told her I had harassed her, and in reality it was abuse,or assault, not harassment at all, I went to read laws about it and the world just fell down to me, I honestly didn't know that was abuse and if I had known I would've reported myself, but I didn't know shit about consent or anything, tho I knew when to stop as a I had done that same day, it's crazy to me, when I started to connecting this,that I acted extremely different at moments, I started to realize I was sick, and being miseducated didn't help at all. 

1 month after that thing in 2018  i was in other party, everything good and fine until I started dancing with one girl and we were really close to each other, and after minutes of dancing with her I tried to kiss her, she said no, then I started to get her far from people, again thinking that creep ass shit could work, I guess if I just told her like what if we go other place? Would've been better if I said that , and I got her to other place and tried to kiss her repeatedly,thinking I was flirting,thinking it was playful, I don't know why, I think I wasn't that drunk at this time but I couldn't realize that I was acting extremely weird. After being persistent she got tired of me and left, day after I didn't apologize,is like at this time I have given in to sickness, as I will explain below. And basically a few days later a friend of mine called me saying that she wanted to accuse me of harassment , but she wanted to talk with me, no by phone or something, in person and I was like OK sure,my friend set a meeting and we met like a Friday at 5 pm to talk about this, they let us talk and she told me that lots of people were saying that she made up with everyone n shit and she thought it was me that was saying that , I told her I wasn't telling anything, that that ish shouldn't have happened at all in a was just acting dumb and drunk, I don't know if I was really cause it happened a long time ago so I can't remember but I think I wasn't that drunk, is just  that somehow I was used to do weird ish at this point, don't fkn know why. At this point I was screwed up, 2 months  after this I quit basketball because of feeling I was trash and didn't feek self esteem at all, and I started my first heavy depressive phase, I kept going to parties that year and never got into  anything with anybody, I was too scared to be persistent again and I never wanted to bother anybody. 

But in halloween of this year (2018) I went to a party with my friends, and this girl that I had trouble with, the one that made up with my friend, with me, the one that always played with me, I got into this party and as soon as she arrived, she just told me wth I was doing there, like she just arrived and started trying to make me angry, she and her friend, all day whenever I said something they were like, ""no you don't say anything"", whenever I put a song on the party playlist, they removed it, they were isolating me from my friends and my friends(lame ass friends) weren't doing anything and I just got drunk as hell,had left my dog alone at home, had spent time and money to go to that party and they were isolating me so I got drunk just to be there without thinking. I connected this too because alcohol really hits me and make me get all my problems  out, basically I got drunk as hell and i lost conscious, I remember just to some point, and when I woke up I was laying on the floor with vomit in my clothes, and a friend telling me that I shouldn't treat people like that, I guess I told this girl that she was a b1tch or sum, honestly I think she deserved it but anyway I acted terrible, and honestly I don't remember this, I just remember waking up and seeing my ""friends"" laughing at me with these girls, and the friend that was trying to make me stop and threatening to kick me out, was a friend that I had always taken care of,if it wasn't for me he could've died from alcohol poisoning, so I felt betrayed and just went full defensive mode, I didn't talk to them or this girl or days and just returned to talk with them, but honestly I was going full shell mode. 

Next year(2019) I was fucked up, didn't talk to more than 2 people at school and I was just a jerk, I was just a depressed fuck, at some point I said to myself : why the hell am I so lonely? And I couldn't do anything, I just started pressuring my best friend to spend time with me without knowing, I was just sick in the head. Went partying a few times and moderated my drinking but I hadn't solved anything, at half of the year I went to the club and started dancing with a girl and did that hand thing again, Im so sure I watched this ish from porn, and that time it ""worked"" because he started grabbing me and we were touching each other above the clothes and all, but my way to approach people was still wrong as shit. This same year i went to other party and when we were leaving I was leaving with these girls that kinda  flirted with me(and made me uncomfortable) lots of times and I just drank pure alcohol to be bolder(dangerous decision, again)thinking that I didn't like her but I needed to make up with someone, I was isolating myself at abnormal levels and I went with her to the subway, I didn't know where I was going and I was getting more drunk, we got alone and we started kissing and we were making up in the subway train with people watching, and there I put her hand in my groin under the clothes (if reading these things makes someone  mad, just tell me I'm a piece of ish or don't help me at all, I know this type of ish isn ok at all), but again it ""worked"" because we starting making up and touching each other, we were horny as hell in the subway in a Friday night, I guess people were just looking at us like what the hell is happening, and then I told her we should have sex and she replied when and we kept talking like that and I got persistent to go somewhere else, I was desperate to have any interaction with someone, for real I wanted to stop living from a year ago, and I couldn't realize a I was in extremely need of help, then we just separated and I realized that I was going to anywhere just to make up with her, i was buzzed, barely could walk and I just left, I felt nauseous and I didn't realize I had to come back home , I just had drank from the bottle to be bolder, I won't ever drink fucking alcohol again and below I'll explain my problems with drinking too. I haven't apologized to this girl, mainly because it was consensual I feel, but if Im able to I will tell her sorry for doing that ish, not to not get exposed on IG or some, just because I acted like a creep and I had to say sorry for my behaviour, and I'll ask her how she feels or something. Just because I'm trying to do better in life. 

When I entered college and throughtout my life I took care of lots of girls for them not to be abused or harassed, I've been congratulated lots of times and I've been told thanks for taking care, for dancing with them to get the creepsters out, even at my first big party I took a friend out of a car when a guy was taking her there,she was absolutely drunk and buzzed, honestly people even clapped their hands looking at me for being such a good guy, but when it came to me,I couldn't controll myself at times and I had an absolutely fucked view of sexual intercourse until I realized it. To this day, I don't know how I got to be like that, I don't know what lead to me to it, I felt tho I had bad view on sex still I didn't persist when it felt  awkward, and most of my classmates knew me as the dumb guy that didn't take the chances to do something with a girl. And my mental issues and alcohol issues contributed, I don't feel shame when saying I fell to sickness. That's how gross those parties were, wont say too much but I got harassed, got my ass grabbed and I was molested more then 15 times in school, even got my butt grabbed in a normal day of class by a group of girls, and everytime even my girlfriends laughed at this, saying I was lying or that I wasn't that cute to get harassed. That's how people were there and now that conceptions had changed everyone denies acting like that.

Now I'll explain my problems, will try not to write that much not to be boring 

My porn problems were huge,i started watching at eleven years old, I got addicted to it from 12-13 and I watched mostly everyday until 22 years old,there was days where I didn't, because days were too busy or I didn't want to but it was an everyday thing, I had a gf at 12,we saw each other 2 times than she just dumped me and made fun of me for a whole year, i never got any interaction with women after that until I got to college where I was about to be 18 years old. All this time I watched porn, 2, 3 times or even 5 or more times a day, sometimes 1, some times 2, I remember being every day saying some times, what the hell am I watching, I watched most type of porn without knowing what I was learning from that, I watched bus harassement type videos, Asian videos which are the worst ish I think, in general industry porn which is just unreal, penetrating people outta nowhere, girls randomly wanting to do things to you, and in general in porn man persist until things happen. I've been battling with perverted thoughts since I am a kid, whenever I was in a bus I had intrusive thoughts (we all do) and it seemed like they happened to me often, I never did anything to anybody at a train or something  because of me being anxious, I had a compulsive mind without knowing that it made me erase some of the ish I thought, whenever a girl put her body on me at a train or sum (happened a lot) I just stepped  back really nervous trying not to make anyone uncomfortable,I had these dumb fantasies or urges like with cousins, teachers, old women and I honestly at some point thought like I was irresistible to women, and I didn't manifest anything because somehow I preserved my consciousness, like wtf I was just a 12 yo kid,and always ended up falling  into porn, stopped some times but I never got out of it, I was addicted to it since a kid. 

My childhood was tragic, we were poor and my mother died when I was 6 years old due to aneurysm, I have 3 or 4 flashbacks of her but nothing more. I was bullied in most schools in middle school, when I was 8 I was bullied a whole year, got my school stuff broken a lot and I didn't even know why I got bad grades, got my foot broken by a classmate that wanted to make me fall, and I had to walk limping for a month until I cried that I couldn't walk anymore, same time i sat next to a classmate that grabbed and touch my balls/groin daily, idk if it was for a week or a month but it was for some time,and it stopped when I told my dad crying that I had done the same  to him, he went to the school to make this stop but school didn't do ish.I had lots of moments stuck in my head, like when I got intimidaded of groups of kids, when everyone laughed at me daily, when a kid threw a pen and the top of it made a hole in my face,and there's more of  all this, I remember it and I don't know why I do. 
Same time as this I was starting to suffer violence from my older brother, which is 9 years older, he  was already dumb and kinda crazy, he suffered epileptic attacks when he was a kid and from there he became violent, and he just lost it when our mom died, it was when he was about to be 15 yo. He cooked for me and my twin sister, he taught me things, he took care of us, he gave me good moments but he just ruined  my mind and was a bigger bully than everybody else. I remember hundreds of violence episodes with him, one time we were making a bed and I didn't put a cover the right way and he started yelling at me and then told me to cry, like putting the blame on me, one time we were playing in a Playstation and I made a mistake, and he shoved me and told me ""retire from everything related to soccer"" or some ish like that, he used  to hit me over little mistakes, being always aggressive as hell and projecting everything to me, there are probably dozens or houndreds of times he has hit me, and not at full force which I think was worse because it was mostly why I got used to it and why I never did anything, when I used to tell my dad, he would wait for him to leave and tell me that I was a coward for not fighting back, and I had to obviate all this, that's the form of  surviving  that I found, and I think that it fucked my life. 

To put it on perspective when I was 17-18 and he was 26, he came to my room to bug me, i kinda hit him in the forehead to take him off me, and he said ""oh OK mf"" or something like that, raised his  hand and if he doesn't think it twice he just knocks me out, if I don't cover myself he probably just knocks me out, and still hit me in my head twice, just not that hard. My sister came to see what happened and my brother  started saying: ""he's hitting me from the back"" , ""he's b1tch slapping"" , and I was like ""wtf, nobody did nothing to you"" and he told me ""ahh how do you say no motherfucker"" and kicked me in the stomach using all his strength while I was laying in my bed, if I don't cover myself, he just breaks something in my body, and that's how his mind has always worked, when he gets a Lil angry he starts saying uncommon ish, ish that didn't happen and ish that doesn't event fit the situation, and he has been like this always, just this year he started following me and ordering me ish and things when he got drunk. And in March he threatened me, said that I was sick and offered me a fight just because I told him that I don't like him. Last year in 2019 he hit  me with 2  full strength punches in my back, just because he got mad over me returning a slap in the back that he gave me, and he just told me that I should go to cry as always, that I'm sick, then he got nervous and started walking over the house and finally put his head on his gf shoulder and went to cry to his room, that's how he is and he's been always like that. 

Our grandmother was crazy too, he's a religious fiend that had preached for years and goes to his house and drowns newborn cats just not to raise them, she used to argue a lot with my brother and even once he told her ""you killed your mother, it's your fault"" in front of me and my sister when we were having lunch, we were like 8 years old. He tried to put religious ish in my mind and traumatized me sometimes even saying the cartoons that I watched were devilish and shit. We wouldn't let her tho because we knew she was sick, and honestly for the life she's suffered its normal, old people could get what I'm saying. 

I discovered a lot of sexual shit as a kid too, nude type games in cousins cellphones, porn cds in my brothers room, and I think even I discovered nude photos of my dad and his girlfriend when I was like 9, I just looked at them  and closed the flip phone, but I think it was too much exposure mixed with all the fucked  shit I went thru.I remember being like 9 and having sudden sexual thoughts sometimes, even when i felt no desire at all so I guess I just had  been mindfucked by life in general. 

I've always randomly doodled, always used to draw dark shit as a kid, eat like crazy since a young age. My father this year told me that at 8 years old I said i wanted to die to go with my mom. And this year I realized that I talk alone at all places, when I'm at the streets I start mumbling alone, and sometime my voice scapes and that's when I realize I'm talking alone, sometimes I've said hi and raise my hand to the air like imaging a friend of mine is there, at times i insult the air without realizing, whenever I remember all the things my brother did to me, I don't realize but I end up punching the air like if my mind was in other place, when I was younger I denied it when I got discovered, saying I was singing sending a voice message  or something . And that's how I felt when doing these things  to these girls and that's how I felt when I was dominated by impulse, I don't realize what I'm doing, I only thought of myself and I couldn't  get that wrong ideas out of my mind, and I'm learning to control it in a way. And Ive felt like a fight of voices in my head, but I guess that's kinda normal, anyway I'll go to therapy obviously. 

I started realizing all this when I was in my worst state ever in quarantine, all this got thru my head, all my wrong acts, well crimes, not like they are just mistakes(?, all that I had suffered started to connect in my mind and it had my head rolling over, I was walking in my house alone till 6 am, mumbling alone, trying to connect shit, trying to remember everything and not make excuses for nothing, just go to the root to know why the hell I am like this. 

Since that Halloween problem in 2018 I wanted to stop living, didn't even knew that I had done shit that was so wrong, and still wanted to suicide, I didn't trust anybody anymore, I felt betrayed and that I was always the rejected person, and honestly I was but as I said I just went full shell mode. I was acting and thinking suicidal for 2 years and even then I didn't think  I needed help. And that's what makes me sad at the end of all, I think my own mechanism to survive made me a sick mf, I think being brave to survive this childhood  fucked my life,if I had just shown signs fo sickness or if I would've been educated about sex I would have never done anything, my dad is a social worker and when I told him everything he said he was sorry, bc he knew I didn't have a mom, he knew I was being touched and bullied and he still didn't take me to a therapist thinking I was doing fine. Plus we were poor as hell, if someone had gone to therapy we wouldn't been able to eat or shit like that, I guess my dad thought he could control everything and I don't blame him, I can imagine the amount of pressure he had. 

 if I could apologize again or if I could apologize for something I haven't, I would, and if I had the chance to do so I will, I know im doing fine, I've been told that there's little to no people that can reflect from his trauma the way I do, I know that I won't ever do dumb shit again, I will go to therapy and I know it will work out but still I feel like my life is over in some aspects, I feel like I won't ever have a gf, because whenever I have one I won't be able to keep my secrets  to myself, and I will tell her everything and  I think most girls will run away from me, where I live recently there was a psychopath that apologized to her ex just to murder  her, and just yesterday a disappeared girl was found dead killed by a tinder date.
 
And even tho is sad, I know  I can't complain, I'm still alive, and I should be in jail really, or I shouldve been exposed on social  media a long time ago. If I had to go to jail ill still would go, and i know seeking punishment doesn't make me better but I would still do it. 

I honestly feel like I'm a good person, I don't know how I preserve my consciousness and I don't know how I've overcame all this, I know bad things were done by me but I don't know I got to turn my life around having those mental issues that only made me defend myself. I think if I would've been helped a little I wouldn't be like this at all, if I had my mom I wouldn't have developed most of this things and I would've been taught to be more sentisitve, because that's the way she was. 

I've been told by people on reddit that I'm full of shit,been told by girls that I rap*d people, that I'm a piece of shit and I should turn myself in (I don't think i could deny that), even a guy told me that I'm making shit up to sound better, but I'm not, I don't think this was avoidable, I was fighting with mental disparity and r4pey shit since a kid and I think I didn't deserve to do so. I think I might have has narcissistic,schizophrenic disorders or sickness without knowing, and I think that my whole life lead me to this, I didn't knew really more than abuse when it came to my home or social life, i had told this to some people and they told me that my friends from college and the environment there was too creepy and they never saw shit like that. 

Concluding, I'm doing better, I puke everyday and cry everyday because I don't think my life has a meaning anymore, but deep down I know I can help my brother so he doesnt traumatized his kid or wife, I know I can help kids to know things better, and in this moment I think I should swallow my pride and realize an even more lonely life expects me. I think I should go out just to play ball, buy groceries, go to therapy and that's it. I want to quit my degree and study psychology or be a teacher, I think I had a lot of knowledge to teach people but I don't think i will be able to do so. I won't kill myself and that's a promise, I know this post sounds like a straight up suicide letter but I won't, my dad did too much for me to ending killing myself. I will go to therapy too and try to get solutions, but I think that a lonely life is what I deserve. I would love to have a gf, would love to feel love from a girl as I never felt besides my sister , I would love to show a girl that I will only do good things for her. But I think it's too late, I think it's too late for me to turn my life around and I should just move silently to help from the shadows. I would love to read your opinions but if not it's all good. 

I analize myself and think what in the world lead me to  act like that and I don't know honestly, I can't see myself sober doing that type of shit, and there's other times that I feel that I am sick and might  do that shit again.. For example when I got drunk some weeks ago I didn't give a shit anymore, I was alone testing myself if my thoughts changed,I thought behaving like that wasn't a big deal , and on the other side other times feel  like my life is over, thanks In advance for your help.

I don't know how I got to be like this, I don't know how my values and principles  changed that much, most of the times I think, nah my life wasn't that tragic and when i tell my friends about my childhood experiences and their faces falls of because they get surprised and don't even understand things like this, I just wish I stopped going to this disturbed parties, I wish I had better friends, I wish I could've  opened with people when I was younger to gain experience in a sane way, I wish my life could've been a little better, I think I already failed as a man and as a son,brother or friend and it is true.
 I feel sick and I feel like I am that calm kid again  now but I guess is too late for me again. I guess I have to stop b1tch1ng and hold my things together, but my mood swings and it really goes low and up. I think I had gone thru all my shit nicely until I was 18 and ended up being sick anyway. I feel like, I was bound to be perverted in some way and it hurts me as it isn't my fault."
Does anyone else absolutely hate this situation? By that I mean getting scolded by your parent(s) and remaining calm trying to explain everything but after some time finally getting annoyed by the situation for that exact second to turn so they're calm out of nowhere trying to act like nothing at all happened and then they getting even more angry just after that because you're annoyed and don't get instantly happy like they did a second ago
"Why should I continue to live?I'm depressed and have been for years now. I've been suicidal before , I've checked myself into the hospital, I've gone to counseling, I've taken (am taking) antidepressants, I exercise, I keep myself busy, I have great friends, and I step outside every day. But I'm miserable. I'm so depressed. I want to kill myself but I feel so guilty because I have so many loans and that will go to my family. and my friends will be sad. 
What do I do? I have tried so many things. I know there is no answer to what to do. I feel like one day I'm just going to get fed up and kill myself. What's the point of continued existence if I have feel so much pain? 
Everyday is a struggle. And its so hard. I don't want to keep living like this. 
Isn't it selfish on the part of everyone else to want me to continue existing when it hurts so much? 
How do all of you work through the hardest times?"
"Why?I just feel that I mess up everything, i only destroy and hurt the few i care about. I wake up day after day, first thought that rushes to my mind is to end it all. I just do see a reason to continue. So I ask why? Why should/shouldn't I?"
Im getting pushed closer and closer.I think I dont want to watch the sun rise anymore.
"My daughter is 14 and has several suicidal friends, are there any resources to help her better support themShe seems to have taken on the role of being her own suicide prevention hotline and support network for her friends. While I am proud of her supporting them I am concerned that she is taking on their depression and is not equipped to deal with this or best support them. Is there a resource you know of to help a teen deal with supporting suicidal friends?"
"I lost the only thing that has kept me from killing myself since 2016I am a graphic designer or was one before everything went to shit last night
I've wanted to kill myself for a long tome but my passion for art and design distracted me for years
When I felt down I'd turn to my laptop and design away and get paid
Now the only thing that I truly loved is gone
I could easily raise the money from this 9-5 store job but getting to that amount before the second lockdown happens isn't possible and people that claimed to support my career have ghosted me

I have nothing to lose anymore and I think I'm ready to die. I need a painless way to kill myself"
"I'm terrible and not worthy and wish I was dead at 35yoI have such anger and anxiety that I am a terrible person. I snap at people, can't accept compliments or concern. I can't be happy and make everyone around me miserable. Kaiser docs just keep feeding me pills, going over the same breathing exercises and making sure I don't kill myself. Seems happiness is not possible,  only stayin alive. Which, being the way I am, and how bad I am, and how there is no hope I'll ever be better, why am I still here punishing my fiance and friends with my shitty existence? I dont have a note or a plan, I just wish I could lay down and disappear into the ground, or go back in time and stop my parents from meeting, nullifying my birth. How do people find happiness and a will to live, when the problem is literally in your head? Why continue to exist for the gamble of happiness and not hurting the ones you love? What can I hope for from tomorrow or continuing to live, if I cant fix myself, and my doctors cant either?"
"She was my everythingI remember being suicidal af but she was the only thing that kept me going. They way she used to tell me I'm worth it... How she hugged me, waiting for me to gain the energy to talk to her. How she was the only one who could understand me... Now that she left me, because she simply fell out of love... I just don't know what to do. I have nothing left to lose. I want to give an end in my life just once and for all. But I have a dermatologist appointment in a few days and I don't know what I'd say if I failed. It's scheduled for next week. We'll see until then..."

"I'm not cut out for this life.I just started college. I wake up at 6:30am to go to a school will 8000+ students, anxiety city. I lay awake at night worrying about my future, so I don't get enough sleep and end up making things worse. I have no talents and no real passion. I'm in psychology, I chose this path because I wanted to help people, but now I don't even feel like I would be capable of that of I can't help myself. As I see my friends less and less I feel us beginning to drift apart, I find it very hard to make friends and am not the type to just randomly speak to the person next to me in class. I don't know what to do, I just needed to say these words somewhere, I have no one to talk to."

"Feeling incredibly alone and borderline suicidal.With the recent pandemic, my physical health has become a huge concern of mine because I suffer from several respiratory issues and allergies. As a result, I've been practically locked up inside my room for the past 3 weeks. I haven't seen my boyfriend, who has since stopped talking to me for a month now, and I feel like we will inevitably break up. My college assignments are all online however I can't find the motivation to do any of them, nor can I bring myself to apply for PhDs because I feel like I don't deserve anything. In addition, my father has started drinking again since he lost his job, and has been physically and verbally abusive. The only person I felt like I could turn to was my boyfriend, but he barely responds to me nowadays. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't see the point of it all anymore. I feel like I'm going crazy being trapped in my room, I have nobody to speak to, and am throwing my life away. The physical and emotional pain is taking a huge toll on me, and I have no idea if I have any other option."

"My LDR boyfriend cheated and now I can't get a hold of himI'm going to keep it short because I need fast answers.

My LDR boyfriend cheated on me and confessed earlier, we talked a bit and I told him I was going to go as I need room. I called my sister and all throughout he texted me. He sent me a vocal message I only heard after the call where at the end of a lot of sorries he said he ""I'll disappear from my life soon enough"".

I can't get a hold of him anywhere and I have no one to call that can go knock on his door. I'm worried sick, what can I do? I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit but I need answers.

TL;DR I can't get a hold of my boyfriend who confessed on having cheated and need options on what to do"

I've suffered with severe anxiety all my life which prevents me getting a job or going back to college and doing what I wanna do. I wanna support my family but with this anxiety I feel like they would be better off with me gone. Struggling really hard right now, sever different types of self harm to cope me through the pain but its not helping which im not surprised. Why shouldent I just end it all here my family would be better off without me."
"anyone else fantasizing about suicide?iâm kinda drunk to cope but is anyone else thinking about intense and action packed ways theyâll commit suicide, like evading the law type shit, and the thrillingly depressing effect it will have on everyone.

"Want To Just Kill Myself, Getting Less and Less Scared of ItI really don't see how people are able to just keep going. I get so mad when I see people who are obviously happy, smiling, motivated in life, or even just able to pick themselves back up. I'm finding it harder and harder to want to keep going at all. I've dealt with depression for a long time now, but for a few years now it's been just unbearable, simply going through the motions without really feeling anything. Even at the start I had a few hobbies, but now I don't have anything. Feel bad when people as what I like to do, because I honestly just don't have an answer. It's enough I go to classes at all, completely numb and unmotivated in the slightest. I'm currently a biology and biochemistry undergrad with piss poor grades. When I started I was simply getting my generals, but at least felt a moment of joy when I declared my major. Though now I'm right back to square one, not caring about my grades and yet still feeling enraged and disappointed at myself for them. Wake up, go through classes and lab, go home, and just sit at my desk alone with YouTube or Netflix, that's really about it for me. I absolutely can't see how the hell I'm supposed to do anything with my life if I'm already like this early on. What's the fucking point?

&amp;#x200B;

Lately all I can seem to think about is how I'd want to kill myself. Seems like the only thing I can do. If I really did, I wouldn't mind just buying a gun or some rope and going out into the woods late at night, decrease the chance anyone could actually stop me. Hell, maybe pop as many pills as I can beforehand for fun. Doesn't matter. At first I was concerned about how much it'd hurt friends and family. But I can't keep going for the sake of others. How the fuck is that something to tell someone anyway? I've never understood how telling someone to keep suffering for your own happiness is meant to be a good thing to tell someone. Killing myself seems like the one thing I know I could do right."

I can't deal with life anymoreI am alone and afraid I don't sleep well at all. The quiet of my home is so loud that it's driving me nuts   I wish someone was here right fucking now I just can't take anymore of this shit. I am isolated abandoned by my adoptive family as they only care about money and success but not that I'm on the fucking edge of hanging myself just to end the misery. I have nothing to offer anyone it would seem. Fuck my fucking life. I want to die in the middle of the night and not give a shit how
"Why is it so easy to purchase a gun?I hit a real frightening low today.
Low enough to research gun ownership and what is needed to walk into a gun shop and walk out with one. 
It takes nothing. 
An ID and a payment method and there you go, a brand new weapon and bullets included in the price. 
The only thought in mind was self harm, nothing other than that. 

I didn't go.
But if anyone looked at my Google history, it'd be cause for concern.
It should be any way.

I'm fine, I give my word but man, there should really be something more to buying one.

Even though a background check would've given zero red flags in my case.

"I am a bad, toxic person and I need to kill myselfI attempted suicide last year by taking a bunch of pills, and I ended up not going to the hospital. I wish I succeeded so badly. My life is so shitty because I'm a shitty person. I lie to people, I'm passive aggressive, I'm petty, I'm negative, and on top of all of that I have multiple mental disorders. I feel like I'm the person everyone warns you to stay away from. I am alone, and I just want to die.


I promised myself I wouldn't go down the pill route again, but I'm seriously considering it. I feel like I need to take my life. I don't want to live anymore. "

"Pushing 30, wife, mother, daughter to suicidal parents, and having a hard time justifying why I am even here.My parent's out was always to threaten suicide when things got difficult. They had a rough childhood and put a lot of emotional burdens on me about it. My mom, especially, used me for emotional support. . . I would almost label her as a narcissist, but I'm not a professional psychologist. 
I am almost 30 years old, a new mom to a 20 month old girl, wife of my high school sweetheart, and I wouldn't say I've accomplished anything. And that's not all. I have serious emotional baggage- and I emulate my parents habit of suicide.

Most recently, tonight, I have thoughts that my daughter would be much better if I was not her mother. My husband would be better of he married someone he actually likes. 

We had an argument earlier that involved continuing my bachelor's degree, money, and whether or not I was being visited by aunt flo. (Cause I'm super emotional about wanting to accomplish something for once.)

Him: ""Degrees aren't everything."" 

Me: ""I know, but it would give me an edge when I start looking for a job in several years after unemployment; and being a stay at home mom."" 

As always ends I end up yelling, acting crazy. . . .then holding myself in our bedroom alone to cry. What kind of mother does this in front of their child!?! The kind of child that wishes I wasn't their mother. The kind of mother who is just screwing up their child in the process. Then my husband sits their cocky and cook as a cucumber. . . Just seems like he's egging me on. I just don't know what to do with my life. I hate myself more than anything. I just wish I found purpose, happiness. I just want to know why the hell am I here if I can't change!! And here I am desperate on the internet cause that dumb ass suicide number doesnt fucking work. I do see a therapist. And I do tell my husband how I feel. I just dont see anyone actually caring enough for me to hold on anymore. I dont want to want to die anymore."

"I'm not even sure why I'm postingI was recently diagnosed with Bipolar disorder after dragging my girlfriend through a year of behavior I couldn't fathom myself. I'm currently going through treatment though. But she witnessed my first manic episode of my entire life and I'm so embarrassed. My mental health is getting better but I don't have any good friends in my life anymore. As I have consistently moved, I was bullied in high school, and one of my two good guy friends from high school came on to me over thanksgiving break last year (I'm a lesbian).

I met my girlfriend my freshmen year of university, fell madly madly in love with her and for 11 months now we have been dating. Month 10 is when I had my manic breakdown. I'm currently home for treatment and it's going really well but until I get back and prove to her that I can balance school, our relationship, and my mental health, I've been feeling really really suicidal. My suicidal thoughts have flared up in years, but this past month it's been an every night kind of thing. 

I don't want to burden her by talking to her about it. I just don't know how to tell myself everything will be okay and believe it."

"My father lost a trial to our healthcare company and I just hate my lifeNotes:

English is not my native language, so sorry about that.

I am from Argentina, so before suggesting anything, take that in mind.

I just want to release a lot of pain. Sorry if this is not the place for that.

This is the first time I write something like this. Sorry for the format, rambling and/or writing a lot.

&amp;nbsp;

My family environment is really toxic. I didn't had a good childhood. My father and brother are really aggressive persons, so violence is, unfortunately, something very common.

My mother has OCD, Frontotemporal dementia and Cycloid personality. Basically, her brain is degenerating and her faculties are reduced. She's been sick for the past 8 years, give or take. The four of us lived all together and my father and brother treated her REALLY bad. Verbal abuse, low physical violence (no more than shaking her and stuff like that).

After years, my father followed my advice and started a procedure with our healthcare company so she could go to a special clinic for people like her and the healthcare company didn't approve it even when my mother's psychiatrist wrote a letter saying that she needed to live there because her sickness was very advanced. So my father started a legal procedure with this company.

A first judge decided that during the months before the trial, my mom had to be moved to this clinic and this company had to pay everything. During the last few months (since the start of the year, aproximately), she lived there and came to my place during weekends.

Today, I found out that my father lost the trial because my mother didn't sign something or something like that, so the healthcare company wants to stop paying everything, she'll have to come back to home and we will owe them 60.000 dollars to pay lawyers, trial, etcetera.

This means my mother will come back home, the environment is going to be shit again, we are going to owe an amount of money that we cannot pay and I just hate everything and want to die.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

UNPOPULAR OPINION None of you have unpopular opinions.
"Posting on a throwaway because I donât want people to think Iâm a freak: I spent all day doing a comprehensive study (accounting for biases) of whether I have had a positive or negative impact on my peers. I suspected that it would be overwhelmingly negative, but I was surprised by the results.Iâm obsessed with data and recently unemployed, so I have lots of time on my hands. Iâve just spent all day completing a comprehensive study of everybody I know and for each person, I asked myself one question: have my actions positively or negatively impacted their lives? Has my existence validated theirs?

I know 848 individuals. I define âknowingâ as a mutual ability to look at a photograph of the other person and identify him or her by first and last name. Of these 848, most were immediately disqualified as âneutral,â meaning my actions have had neither a positive nor a negative impact on their lives, OR that my actions have had an equally positive and negative impact.

28.5% of individuals (242) were identified as ânon-neutralâ actors. Of these, it was determined that I had a net positive impact on at least 117 and a net negative impact on at least 103. 22 were classified as ânon-neutral without category,â meaning that I impacted their life, but a positive or negative skew remains ambivalent.

Furthermore, this study was deeply flawed:

1) there was a confirmation bias as a result of my mentality going into it and the judgement of my own mind, and

2) family members were never classified as ânegative,â and rarely classified as âneutral,â so my 29 family members skew the data. 

Here is why the results surprised me: I expected an overwhelming number of ânegativeâ impacts and few, if any positives. Instead, there were more positive than negative. As I made the list and checked it twice I looked at all those positive names and knew that I couldnât commit suicide for their sake, at least not yet. Some of these people are quite old and as they pass, the negative scales will draw closer to equilibrium.

**TL;DR: thought I was hated, turns out itâs pretty neutral**"

"I'm sorrySo I don't know if I belong here or if I'm just over reacting 

This is a throw away account as I can't let it get back to me or anyone I know 

You need to know

1.I'm transgender (mtf) I have been on hormones for nearly a year

2.I have a boyfriend we've been together for about 4 months

3.I have a massive amount of dysphoria down there between my legs anal sex if fine and I love it but stay away from that bit

4. I have told my boyfriend no.3 multiple times I told him when we first met

5. This started 3 weeks ago

Ok we were in bed together and well he wanted to have some ""fun"" I was asleep he woke me up by grabbing down there and started to move his hand doing things that a guy would probably like

I woke up pretty fast but I had no energy to do anything (I'd just finished my work week and he woke me up after only about 2 hours of sleep) other then weakly try and move his hand

This goes on for probably half an hour before he stops at that point I curled into a ball and started crying

He tried to hug me and was saying he didn't care I had that part and he was just trying to make me feel good

We stop having sex I tell him it's my meds as I thought that's what it was

Fast forward to yesterday I was talking to a co worker I don't even know how we got onto this topic but I told her 

She got really angry at him and told me that was rape or at the very least sexual assault 

I get home and can't stop thinking about it now she's said that

 I don't know what to do"
"It doesnt make senseIm 14 years old and have been thinking on and off about suicide for the past couple of years. At first I didnt even realize I was suicidal. At 12 I used to imagine what would happen if I died. What would my parents do. I decided that eventually everyone I knew would move on, and eventually die themselves. Now I am thinking of acting on that. Just thinj about it. Life doesnt make sense. Why did humans evolve. Why did we choose to destroy nature and wrongle it around to make housing. Why do we coom our food. None of it makes sense. It makes no sense to continue blindly with something that makes no sense. Social interactions make no sense. Why should it matter whether or not someone looks a certain way or acts a certain way. I know if I just power through high school I should be ok but I dont know if I am strong enough. Even if I do manage to escape high school the cycle just continues. As a upper middle class white boy my life will go 1 of 3 ways and I already know this.
1. I go to an average college work and average 6 figure job and get a wife, settle down and maybe have kids, die at 80 something. All the while I wonder what more I couldve been.
2. I drop out of school and do wahtever dropouts do until I finally realize again how fleeting life is and end it all
3. I end it with a note to my parents apologizing later tonight and finally accept that none of these fates are good, even the first one because in the end we all die, no matter what you do in life, how many people you impact.
Also I want to belive that it is about the journey, not the destination like ive read so many times on this subreddit but it just doesnt make sense to me, all the journey you take will be forgotten, along with the journeys of all the others youve inpacted and all the ones theyve inpacted until the sun finally takes pity on humans and expands to engulf our pathetic, puny society that we built"

"I wish I had the strength to let goI haven't ever been completely happy or really carefree, even when I was a kid. There was just too much on my mind always. When I was thirteen, my mom died. I thought I knew sadness before but I must not have. I broke into a million pieces and people just watched. I picked up self harm and suddenly it just dawned on me that I'm never going to be the same. People treated me like I should be over it, as each year passed, I felt their exhaustion with my deterioration. Then I lost my grandfather. I was gaining weight rapidly, binge eating, my quality of life and self-esteem somehow got lower. A few days after my 17th birthday, I was done. I was in enough pain and I was done, but I failed. I got put in therapy and meds. My dad stopped driving me to therapy after a few months, told me that I ""should be good now"". 

At 18, I lost my sister. She was my best friend right after my mom. I watched her kids with her husband, moved in with them so he could work and adjust to being a single dad. Soon he wasn't going to work as often, likely also because of depression, which meant not a lot of money or food. I was eating less so the kids could eat and suddenly I went from binge eating to starving myself. I lost 100 pounds and they all applauded for the fat person who seems to be getting their life together.

And now here I am, 21, I keep talking myself out of it but all I want to do is die. If they all knew how badly I wanted to not exist anymore, they'd probably help me."

Highschool is literally hell on earth



During the quarantaine I couldn't bring myself to work  and I missed a lot of lessons. Some of them will be required for this school year.



During the holiday I couldn't do anything other than laying in my bed being depressed and anxious about school. I tried to work but I just couldn't do it



I wanted to learn japanese during my free time but I just wasted months doing absolutely nothing



I hate highschool so much, I am forced to be ""friends"" with people that hate me, and that I hate. I don't get along with anyone and on top of that I have social anxiety



All the teachers suck in my school.



And I can't even get ""good enough"" grades because I have excellent grades, so I will be forced to work to keep them (but I have skipped a lot of classes during quarantine)"

A couple of years ago when I was in 6th grade I had a teacher, well this teacher wanted to get our reading scores up (half the class was below 4th grade reading level) so to get us to read if we wanted to get to have the 30 min of extra recess to do stuff we would have to read 2 books and take a test on them, well I was ok because I thought I would be exempt because my reading score was at college and I obviously knew how to read well, wrong, she thought that me reading manga and not reading and taking tests on ânormalâ books was bad enough to be punished.

You see, I was 'that guy' at high school, the average guy who was friends with everyone but not anyone's specific best friend, you know what I mean. Well, my new friend was the first time I had actually connected with anyone ever, the first time I could say that I had a 'best friend' without being a liar.

Sometime later my friend decided to tell me how she felt about me. Apparently she is autistic and had lots of trouble even talking to others at school without help. I was her first real friend. She was very anxious about telling me that she loved me, in case I found her weird. Of course I didn't and we kissed for the first time. But over time, I discovered that her parents died in a car crash while she was young and was forced to live a lonely life with her grandparents. No siblings, no friends and her cousins lived on the opposite of the world. I was a very special person to her and I greatly appreciated it. 

After uni we decided to travel the world together. However, we only had the money to travel around Europe for a month while staying at dodgy hostels and what not. We jokingly promised that we can go on a 'world adventure' for our honeymoon, although she wasn't bothered in marriage, or even children in fact. We both just wanted to live our lives to the fullest, while changing lives around us for the better. I could spend forever listing the stuff we did, but that's not the point of my story.

Over time however, we grew apart, at one point she moved to Australia, but came back 2 years later after her boyfriend started threatening her. Meanwhile, I had landed a nice job in the centre of London. We eventually reconnected and started taking marriage and our 'honeymoon' seriously. All seem to be going well...

And then, well to be honest this part of the story is hard to write about. One normal night about 18 months ago, I was woken up at 4am by her grandad urging me to come to the hospital immediately. Apparently, during one of her work night-outs, she was hit by a car running a red light, speeding away at about 60 or 70 miles per hour. If she had hesitated even a second the car would have simply passed in front of her. No, instead fate dictates she would have to die in her late 20s without saying goodbye. What happened after is a blur, but my boss was nice enough to let me have some time off. But no more time for any nice world adventure or anything like that.

Long story short, I had died as well, even if only on the inside. My best friend forever was snatched away from me, just like that. Now I just wanted to die. But I didn't know how to. I returned to work, but I keep treating each day as a day that I 'survived.' But I don't want to 'survive' I want to live with her, even though she was no longer with us. There is no hope. None. At one point I had to restrain myself from jumping in front of Tube trains and forbid myself from using them.

But recently, during one of my 'I wanna die now' periods one of her workmates recognised me from the funeral. After telling her how I felt and how I wanted to kill myself, she told me about how my friend would constantly talked about me. Apparently, years ago during uni she wanted to kill herself, but she didn't want to upset me. Oddly enough I managed regained some strength after hearing about that. Maybe if there really is an afterlife, she is still rooting for me to live a good life.

Nowadays, I am still trying to improve myself, by hitting the gym and rebuilding my social life, although I can never just 'get over it.' This has been really really hard to write about, but I just needed to tell someone, if anyone is still reading. I still miss her really really much, and one day I hope to travel the world just to fulfil our promise. Sometimes, I still think that I just want to disappear forever, but what would be the point of that? I'm here to change lives for the better. And she would be proud of that."
Should I just pack up and run awayI donât have much money atm but Iâm sick of being here. I kind of just want to pack things up and donât say anything and just go somewhere different. I think thatâs honestly the best option for me to build a better life somewhere else for myself. NYC is too expensive and Iâm sick of new jersey. I have a bachelors degree and Iâm 23 so what do I have to lose.  I guess Id rather sleep in my car in the freezing cold.

"I give up. Life isn't worth it anymoreLost all my friends over the past 2 days. Now that I think about it, they weren't my friends in the first place. I don't see myself going anywhere in life. I don't care if my parents are going to miss me. It's selfish of them to stop me. All I need now is a method, and the house to myself. But when it comes down to it, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do it. And honestly, that thought scares me more than anything."

Im also a metal head and i listen to classic rock (60's to 80's) too along with grunge like nirvana or alice in chains.

I think Iâm most suicidal during the summerIâve heard of seasonal affective disorder but I thought it was only the winter months that drag people down. Iâve got it backwards apparently. I never wanna off myself more than when itâs hot and humid. Itâs only then too that my life always goes to crap. Iâm backwards. My whole life is a mistake. Give me one good reason why I should continue this pointless cycle.

"For anyone that wants to ask someone out, but is too scared to, then I have a quote for you (It is not my quote, and I cannot give credit sadly... No name was listed. Oh, and of course this quote goes for many other things too, I was just using a relatable example). âI do not believe in a fate that falls on men however they act; but I do believe in a fate that falls on them unless they act.â (This is gender neutral.

"Having friends is tiring I just start homeschool and have a discord server with some old friends from public school. Got really close to them over the years, but I have to constantly call them out for how insensitive they can be some times.

I have a real sensitive friend that they constantly mouth off every time theyâre mad. Heck, theyâve even done it to my little brother... But every time I confront them, they say Iâm âtoo niceâ. When Iâm pissed at them, itâs because Iâm overeating. Known them for years, but I think Iâm done, and am going to try to find new peeps."
"Feeling trapped.I'm a 20 year old male.  All my life I've had this feeling that everyone around me dislikes me. This causes me to always feel trapped and distant from people i know and people i want to meet.   When i speak i feel like no one ever listens,  I'm always asked to repeat what I've just said or they just stop listening entirely. This causes me to lose sleep over being such an useless idiot.  I often contemplate suicide,  I just feel alone and that if I died it would just be easier.  I doubt i would be remembered for much longer than a month."

"I think I reached my breaking point and I canât do it anymore.Iâve tried and tried so hard. Iâve kept my depression and anxiety to myself for years to not burden anyone. Itâs been such a dark and lonely road. 2020 being the absolute worst and I canât deal with it anymore. I am so so tired.

Iâve tried to bring it up to family and friends, but they have their own problems. I have never felt so alone in a house full of people. Being taught about suicide growing up in a religious family, I was told it was the most selfish and dumbest thing to do. As a young child, I guess I didnât really care.

Then I became a young adult and itâs the only escape I can think about. I feel so hopeless and lost. I tried to casually bring up the topic of depression and was immediately told itâs just something the media makes up. I asked my family what would happen if a relative killed themselves. The responses I received were that they wouldnât attend the funeral because it is a sin. They wouldnât even acknowledge it happened and move on.  I guess I should have known better than to ask because it made me even sadder, but it kept me from killing myself then.

I think about that time and kind of chuckle to myself. If I had killed myself then, I wouldnât be here writing this now. I wouldnât have gone through another 5 years of misery. I should have just saved myself and everyone the time. 

When I became depressed, I should have known something was wrong. I mean my life was crumbling and I was falling deeper and deeper into the hole I was in. I just wanted to lay in bed and sleep my life away. I was no longer afraid of death. I no longer feared anything. I was petrified of heights and one day found myself sitting on a cliff staring at the Pacific, something I would have never done. 

So many things changed. I couldnât sleep anymore. I no longer felt like I was living, but more so just existing. I went from taking life head on with so many future plans to just trying to tough it out day by day. 

I donât remember the last time I genuinely laughed or smiled. I just feel so consumed with darkness. I canât recall my favorite foods, my favorite songs, my favorite...anything. Someone asks me what I want in life and I canât answer the question honestly without coming off as someone that needs to be locked up in a psychiatric ward.  

I spent a lot of my energy making sure the people around me lived the best life. I tried to be humble, to be kind, and to be as selfless as possible. I realize now, I did that because it was something I couldnât do for myself. Life keeps getting more and more difficult, no matter how hard I try. I feel like Iâm running in place, taking a step forward only to be pushed 2 steps back.

The past few days Iâve contemplated suicide and honestly, itâs the most comforting thing. I wish there was an easy, painless way to do it. Iâm sad but incredibly relieved. Itâs like Iâm seeing the light at the end of tunnel. 

I really donât know why Iâm writing this. I guess, I just wanted to say that I tried. I tried to live. And that this was my choice. My one selfish act for myself. Maybe someone I know will find this post if they dig deep enough through my stuff. Or maybe no one will find this. 

I guess it doesnât really matter either way."
"Tried AgainTried to bring myself happiness by making art. Had a stressful exam today and I tried to end with making a drawing. I didnât work out and I feel worse than I did before. I fucking hate my life so much. No matter what I do, I end the day wanting to hang myself. I canât even commit suicide in this house. There is nothing here for me. The people around me only remind me of hanging myself. I wish there was somewhere to escape to but thereâs nothing. I am trapped. I just wanted to vent. I donât even think Iâm looking for anything at this point. I just want to let go."
"I am destroyedI've been mentally ill since I was at elementary school. It's got worse and I've had to spend time in hospital. Got 'better' because I didn't want to let anyone down but I didn't actually get 'better', just discharged from everywhere and a job.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to die. It's not an impulsive, emotional decision that I'll regret tomorrow. It's a decision I've made rationally. I just can't imagine ever getting past this point and anything ever becoming less difficult. I have nothing, really, to live for.

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinely feel that this is the end. I've overdosed twice but neither times had the guts to tell anyone and neither time has it been successful; just painful. I want to go now."
"Ok well it happened I was in bed last night, wondering if I should tell my crush that I like her, and after like thirty minutes I finally got the balls. I said it, I said I have for a while and I would still want to be friends if she said no. In her words: ""sheeeesh buddy I'm finna be yo first kissð"" and for some reason I thought she was joking. But the next day we were hanging out and out of no where boom, it happened. Straight up. I mean I thought I had no chance, she seemed so out of my league but wow. I honestly, and sadly, thought I would never feel the touch of a woman ngl. But wow.
I mean how. like what. bruh I need more self confidence."
"Some questions regarding suicideI've struggled with mental illness and suicidal ideation for a very, very long time. I had some questions on seeking help I guess.

"I've got an old friend who's in serious trouble. Advice?He's 20, real good guy. He's recently gotten himself clean of drugs, looking to get himself in a better position, but he's apparently battling a pretty serious problem with depression. I only learned this a few hours ago, after I called him up for the first time in years... he had been posting some pretty ominous stuff on his facebook.

I guess he fucked up his arm today after skipping out on a doctor's appointment to discuss his depression. When he talked with me, he said he had been battling this for years and said he didn't want to fight it anymore. We talked for a while, and he promised he would get help on his day off tomorrow. We made plans to meet up later in the week and catch up, he seems to be doing better... but now what?

Do I call the hotline for him, or what? He said he'd flip out and leave if they tried to put him on suicide watch, and I don't want to piss him off or make his situation worse."

"My dad might be planning on killing himself.  I don't know what to do.I just got off the phone with him and it sounds really bad.  I'm sorry if this is long, but I want to go over as much history that's relevant.

Several months ago my dad lost his job when they randomly drug-tested him and found out he smoked pot recently.  He's spent 25+ years working his ass off in the natural gas industry being severely underappreciated.  Now he's blacklisted in that field because of the circumstances of his firing.  He told me that even the thought of working again makes him sick.  He's just so sick of busting his ass and not being appreciated for it.  It seems he has no desire to even want to get a new job.  After he lost his job, he and my mom had planned on starting a business selling concert ticket collectibles, but he tells me my mom just lost interest in it and wouldn't let him do what he wanted to do so now he just lays in bed almost all day.  A few months ago he attempted suicide.

Yesterday I got an e-mail from my mom that they decided to get a divorce.  Apparently life back home is not going so well.  They had been going to couples therapy, but they had to stop because they just couldn't afford it anymore since my dad stopped working.  My parents hate each other and can't stand being in the same room together.  From what my dad tells me, my mom stopped loving him years ago.  He considers being home with my mom to be hell and just wants out now.

He's planning on moving out but he has no money and no job.  I asked him what his plan was, and he told me he doesn't know.  He's planning on just leaving all his possessions behind and starting anew with nothing.  He said once he leaves he probably won't contact me again since he won't have a phone or an e-mail address.  I asked again him how he would get by and he said he didn't know and that he'll either find a way or he won't and die.

He's currently on anti-depression medication, but I don't even know if he is taking it.  When I asked him about it, he said he doesn't even care anymore and that it's too late for him.  When I showed my worry for him, he told me that he wasn't going to kill himself today or tomorrow.  But that's as far down the line as he would say.  He held his composure until the end of the conversation when out of the blue he told me that he was proud of me.  I told him that I loved him and he said he loved me and then, crying uncontrollably, he told me goodbye and hung up.

My name is Steve, and I'm probably not going to kill myself now.  I am also probably not going to kill myself tonight, or tomorrow, or at least until I decide I've had enough, which is probably fairly soon.

I am not one for theatrics.  I don't like to complain and I personally can't stand sob stories from people about how terrible their perfect life is.  I know this is hypocritical as what I'm about to write is basically exactly that.

I am, for some strange reason, I'm running out of fucks.  I just cant seem to muster a single fuck about anything in my life.  I have several hobbies but unfortunately I can't seem to derive an ounce of pleasure from any one of them.  I will spend thousands of dollars of money I don't have trying to make myself happy with things I know full well will make me unhappy for having spent the money on.  Still, the fucks I had to give about either having the items, or caring about the spent money are nowhere to be found.

I am in a long-distance relationship, one that was a short-distance relationship, but she moved 3000 miles away with relatively short notice.  I have been saving my money to get out there and applying for jobs, but so far, 7 months in, I have completely lost steam.  I want to want to find a job, but I find I don't have a fuck to give about that either, and I am quickly hemorrhaging the fucks I have to give about the relationship as well.

I am obese, and I eat my emotions.  This is quite stupid of me.  I understand exactly what I am doing as I am eating the foods I do, but again, the fucks I would have given about this situation are not present.

Recently, I have begun holing myself up in my room after work for the entire night until I have to work again.  All I do in here is drink and browse Reddit.  I should exercise, I should search for a job, I should get outside or hang out with friends, but unfortunately my fuck budget is rather constricted at the moment.

Currently, I am quickly running out of fucks to give in general.  The thought of suicide has crossed my mind several times, though recently it is changed from something that was ridiculous to think about to something that is somewhat more of an option.  I found a fuck to give about that.  I don't want to lose this fuck.  This fuck is the only thing I really have going for me at this point and I need to get some more fucks together before I end up doing it.

Someone, please give me something constructive to do that will fix my lack of fucks.  Someone please show me where I can find some motivation to do things I used to want to do.  Someone please help.

I want to re-iterate, I do not feel the need to kill myself now, but I can see where I'm headed and I don't like it, but I just don't know what to do to get back to where the thought becomes ridiculous again.

"How can I get help? Please helpHey guys I'm not sure how you can help me but I feel like you might be able to cheer me up or just listen because I'm done with my life and I hate it because I've got so many problems at once and it's not like they're small problems they're big and can't be solved easily, I want to run away from my parents because they force me to do stuff I don't want to do, and if I don't, they get abusive and it's slowly really tearing me apart, I'm feel like a marionette, I just go to school, come back home, start working with my mum all day, and I swear it lasts till night when I'm exhausted and can't do anything for school so instead of doing my homework I go to bed, then the other day is the same, I've told my teacher about how it's at home but nothing happened, I wasn't even sure what I expected, my grades in school are the worst and my parents expect me to get a well paid job, and I don't know what to do when I show them my school certificate, I applied for schools but I got declined by all of them, I'm waiting to get 18 so I go away anywhere far away from my parents but I still have to wait for more than a year, and I'm afraid that when I am away, I'd get more depressed and that I will think of suicide but I don't want it, I think life can be beautiful but then I think of how it will get beautiful for me because I know I'll never be able to forget my parents and siblings, I don't want to go to those child protective services because I don't want my parents to get in trouble because of me and I know that my father will bring me to the Mid East and kill me there if he'd find out, I don't know what to do I'm in Germany and I'm 16 how can I get help??? Please I don't know what to do I'm afraid

thanks a lot"

"I called a suicide hotline on my way home from work last nightI made a throwaway account because many family members know my main. 

Last night at work was a particularly difficult one. Ideation would not leave my head all night and I didn't know what to do. All night I kept thinking of what I should do so I don't have to go through another one of these days. I could drive my car off a bridge. I drive over the same exact one every single night on my way home. It would be so easy. I got off work and into my car and broke down. I called a hotline to stay on the phone with me until I got home. I don't know what to do anymore. It gets better, and then it gets worse than I ever thought possible. I see no future for myself because I just get closer and closer every single time. I'm so lost.

Thanks for letting me vent."
"I Really Want to Fucking DieI think my girlfriend is pretty much over me. She doesn't laugh or smile when we spend time together anymore but I constantly see her having a great time on social media with this one guy. I have addressed her disinterest in me but she pretty much brushes it off and still acts cold toward me. Today she said when she gets back from studying she wants to discuss some stuff with me. I love her so much and I genuinely think I am going to wind up killing myself if this ends tonight. It's not her fault though, its mine. I have been depressed forever and I don't have much of a future as far as I can tell. I don't like going to college. I don't like anything I do really. But I do like her. It feels like my heart is being slowly torn out from my chest. This might finally be what pushes me over the edge."

"Called suicide hotline, they traced the call and sent policeSo I'm a vet with PTSD. I called the hotline because I was just overwhelmed and I didn't want to feel like that anymore. Feeling pretty helpless. I made it extremely clear that I wasn't going to kill myself. I did say that I wanted to die, but I said over and over again that I wouldn't kill myself. I never even gave her my name, just some basic info like what state I lived in and when I got out. 

Without my permission, she somehow found TWO of my addresses and sent police to two separate houses at 5am. 4 cops woke up my tenants and then two woke my entire family up.

I'm just sad that I don't have that resource if I'm ever having a really rough night. I will never feel safe enough to call them again. I feel very violated by the whole experience and now I'm wondering if the call was recorded or if it's in my VA medical record? I called the 273-HELP one and you have to press 1 for vets, so I bet that combined with help from the police is how they traced it. 

I'm humiliated that so many people now know way too many personal things about me because the police asked for me by name and said why they were there. I feel very betrayed. "

"I finally realized how much of an asshole my dad is My parents are divorced. All my life, I have idolized my dad. To me, he was this super cool guy who took me to Chuck E. Cheese's when I was little and gave me a laptop. Up until recently, I thought he was just awesome. But then, I saw him shout at my little brother for trying to hang out with him and talk to him. That's when I started thinking back, really thinking about how life with him was. He would constantly emotionally abuse me, shouting ""Fuck off,"" at a 7-year old, sending him and his brother to school with cockroaches and moldy food in our lunches, constantly making empty promises. Then my mom showed me her texts with him, and that was when I snapped. He was such a fucking prick, he quit his job so he would have to pay the minimum child support, he called my AMAZING mom a ""twat waffle sandwhich,"" said he ""stole his twenties,"" and is just a manipulative asshole. I inherited some of his not-so-great traits, and I'm working on that, but I'm so glad I finally saw theough the mirage and realized what a prick he truly is, and how amazing my mom and step-dad are."
"Being pushed but judgement when Iâm dead stops me.Iâm 26/F
I just want to die, itâs this imploding feeling that I sit back and watch myself do.
I live with my mum and dad and younger sister,
The only reason Iâm still here is because of my sister.
My mother is very much like me and I constantly see her own mental health issues.
It makes me realise that that is where Iâm going and makes it seem even more pointless.
Life is just to much recently with the stresses of work and uni, I want to take a break from uni but my families judgement is to much.
3 months ago I broke my shoulder and it stopped me doing a lot of the things I use to like the gym and be able to work.
This injury has broken me mentally and the only way I found to cope was to turn my pain into distraction by pursuing a guy I liked and talking to him everyday over the past 4 months.
As of yesterday I finally decided to set things straight and have it confirmed that he doesnât want to lead me on... fair he did it in a nice way but I feel like thatâs it then because he did distant himself and I should just leave him alone.
Between all this happening I just feel like a pest to him, my friends, my colleagues and my parents.
No one really knows the suffering I have been feeling lately and I know if I kill myself everyone will be like blah blah blah she killed herself over this guy.
Thatâs not true at all.
I want to kill myself because Iâm over this repeative means of life, the last few years are constantly the same and Iâm watching people come and go out of my life and I feel stuck.
Iâm just over existing.

I want to kill myself but iâm too scared I have severe depression and when I was starting to feel happiness it was all taken away yesterday. Iâm back to constantly thinking about how much I donât want to live anymore. I need someone to talk to iâm so stuck right now. Iâm not good enough. I donât usually post much on reddit so this is really hard for me.
And here I am again. My meds stopped working. Iâm lost. I need help and support.I canât stop thinking about ending it all. Nothing works anymore. I wanna go to the ER tomorrow but Iâm scared to be hospitalized. Thereâs also drugs in my system and even though Iâm 21 I donât want my parents to find out and be even more disappointed. I donât know if I want to get better or let this get me. But I want to talk to a doctor. Iâm lost. Iâm very very lost.

"I am completely worthlessI have been trying like hell to find another job after being fired in June but it feels like I've been blackballed from the optical industry. All I feel like I'm good for is being a basic minimum wage cashier. Nobody wants me for anything else and something tells me nobody will want me for a cashier job either. I can't afford to keep my apartment because unemployment doesn't bring in enough money. I've already sold off all I can but it wasn't enough.

Maybe I should take the hint and just give up on everything. Life, job, hobbies, everything. This hint is made even stronger since when I ask what I can improve about my interview skills all I get is ""nothing really you just weren't a good fit"". So there's nothing I can do to improve then what's the point? I should just die right now and save all the disappointment and heartache."
"Iâm A Fu*king Idiot For Thinking Iâm Actually Worth Something... (tw: depression, suicide, dysphoria, family issues, etc).I'm fucking stupid if I think transitioning (Iâm Male to Female Transgender) is gonna stop me from being anything but a boring, friendless, hollow piece of shit.

I'm never anyone's first choice.

I'm either ""you'll do"", ""I need something from you"", â2nd or 3rd choice"", or ""sure I'll take your money and pretend to give a fuck about you"". 

Life is gonna find a way to deny me HRT, I just know it.

It seems to absolutely love getting me excited about something only to yoink it away last second.

Anything fun, productive, rewarding, enriching, educational.

I don't deserve it.

I donât even have control over the temperature in my own apartment (central boiler radiant heat). 

Iâm completely at everyoneâs mercy for almost everything. 

The only thing I deserve is to work full time then go home to a 15x20 concrete cell and lay in bed and stare at the ceiling, looking forward to going back to work in the morning cause that's the only human interaction I ever get unless someone needs something from me.

I call myself a dj but it's been almost 2 years since my last gig.

I've had to sell 2 vehicles at a loss because of reasons I could have easily repaired myself, but they both broke down in the winter and I didn't have so much as a parking spot to park it in till the spring when I could work on it myself.

I get jealous of people talking about doing yard work and planting gardens.

People with workshops where they can build and create.

Somewhere to work out.

I can't even get fresh air without stepping out of my apartment building.

I don't have so much as a fucking hamster to look forward to at the end of the day.

I couldnât even keep a fucking cat alive, what makes me think I deserve comfort and companionship?

I don't have anyone to eat meals with.

I don't have friends that I hang out with more than every few months.

I don't get invited anywhere.

Even before covid.

I've only ever had one genuine relationship that didn't involve getting cheated on or getting taken advantage of.

I've never had a repeat sexual relationship with anyone, and no one that wasn't multiple times my age.

I've always been a pathetic human.

Itâs been a 29 year rut and at this point this list of things I've had to resign myself to never going to happen is longer than both the list of things I've done and the list of things I still have a possibility of crossing off, combined.

Iâve lived my life listening to my parents.

Now my moms dead and Iâm a failure in my dads eyes. 

I want to sew.

I want to work on my vehicle.

(I have to get one again first).

I want to tend a garden.

I want to maintain a yard.

I want to DJ.

I want to have someone to cook for and to cook for me.

I want something... someone... to look forward to going home to.

But:

I don't have the space to set up a sewing machine.

I don't have a vehicle anymore, let alone somewhere to work on it.

I don't have a yard or a garden.

I can't even get fresh air without getting ready and leaving my building.

I haven't had a gig in almost 2 years. 

Even before covid I only managed to have people over at most once a month or two.

I could be homeless and 99% of people would never know. 

The only gay bar in town isn't a safe place for me since new management took over in 2017 and went right to work pushing me out after working there for 5 years, and making it perfectly clear in no uncertain terms that I was neither wanted nor welcome around there. 

I've been trying to get out of this city for years.

Hell, I only intended to stay here a year at most.

That was 2013.

I don't even have a vehicle anymore. 

My dad has proven himself to be a total piece of shit that I don't trust anymore, even without him finding out Iâm trans.

Heâs disappointed enough that Iâm bi/pan.

He makes no effort to hide his disappointment.

Which means I'm gonna have to take a match to everything but what I can carry on my back and walk away from this shithole of a city and never look back.

I donât want to have to keep in contact with him once he finds out Iâm trans just for the sake of coming back to get my stuff some day. 

Anxiety has been running wild today.

Another Friday with nothing to look forward to but coming back to work on Monday morning, knowing I've got 2 days of solitary confinement to look forward to.

I can't keep this up.

Even the weed has stopped working for me.

9/10 times I get absolutely nothing from it anymore.

I'm so fucking tired of hearing ""it gets better"" cause it just keeps finding new ways to get worse.

Just when I think I've lost everything I could possibly lose, life finds a way to strip something else away from me.

""It gets better"" is fucking bullshit.

Even before covid my sanity was hanging on by a thread. 

Now I canât go sit at the far end of the bar and pretend that anyone in the bar would give a rats ass if I was alive or dead. 

I canât go loitering at malls and thrift stores (charity shops) to spend money just so I can have the cashier to tell me to âhave a nice dayâ cause itâs the only way I get to hear it, but I know ultimately itâs just business and they say that to everyone... 

Iâm trying to hold on, but Iâm running out of things to grasp onto.

Iâve stopped caring. 

Iâve stopped looking both ways before crossing the street.

Iâve stopped texting first cause all I ever get is left on read.

Iâm a fucking moron if I think HRT is going to make me like myself any more.

Thereâs no saving me anymore.

The best I deserve is a slow, painful death.

Not even the courtesy of quick and painless.

I'm transgender. I fucking loathe my body and its existence. Sure, there are surgery options to help, but it's not the same. It's fake. I'll never be able to afford them anyway. Even if I get surgeries, I'll always be someone born a boy, and people will hate me for it. Everyone hates people like me. Maybe in 50 years it'll be a non-issue, but there's no way I'm going through those years waiting for total acceptance. 

 I'm going to be dead soon. I've decided. I'm going to give the world and the universe what it wants. I regret all of the money my parents and family have wasted on me throughout my 17 years of living. All of the food, clothes, and hospital visits for all of my mental disorders. They'll probably be sad at first, but they'll be able to invest their money into better things like retirement, more free time, and my mother's health. I wish that it didn't have to be this way, but I'd like to spare my family the disappointment before I turn 18 and have to do shit I'm just not capable of doing. I'm sure the people of the world will be happy knowing one less trans person is alive. I'm happy to oblige them. 

Anyway, thanks for listening, or not. Sorry to be such a downer. I don't know if I'm here to get help, but I just want somebody to listen."

Im tired of all this self-inflicted pain that Im causing my own actions. I am one lazy piece of shit, just a huge procrastinator. In the end I feel like i deserve to die.

"Unusual, scary condition. May kill myself if it keeps up.
I'm an avid reader.  Long time ago, I came to a realization that there was a love for books and stories imprinted as early as in my childhood days but was too unaware to tap into.  Helped develop my talent of writing as well.  
Now I'm in danger of losing that passion completely.  Lately, I've experienced a weird, unsettling problem.  Certain books are now giving my hands stinging sensations, the feel of burning charcoal.  Something that's never happened before until about a year ago.  But it was relatively mild compared to now.  Even the books I have that are, say, only a month old, they're uncomfortable to hold for extensive periods.
This new development has stressed me so to the point of depression and suicidal thoughts.  How could I have developed such a crippling condition?  Reading and getting inspiration from it is the only hobby left that gives me purpose.  How can I enjoy it with this sudden malignity in my hands when I hold a book?
I'm so scared.  If this keeps up, or gets worse, then I'm going to end it all.  Unless there's a cure out there.  Doubtful because I can't even find basic information or support on this condition.  So far, it's looking hopeless.  Not much faith left.

"Uhm so I'm trying to get myself to call the suicide hotline but I have too much anxiety to to through it and would like some help/advice.As I said, I started calling the hotline but once the automated message came on my anxiety really spiked, I could hardly breath and had to hang up.

As it's roughly 4am here and the whole coronavirus lock down is happening I can't get help from elsewhere. I'm just really scared to actually talk to someone, since I never talk to anyone about my problems. I came to a realization that I either need to get help or I will actually kill myself. If I can't get myself to do something about I know that I will kill myself.

Has anyone reading this called a hotline before? Did it go well? Was it really awkward when you first started the call? Did they know what they were doing?

I'm really nervous they'll talk to me and realize how completely unstable I am and hospitalize me. Last time I talked to someone for help I was instantly thrown in the hospital. I tried to kill myself in January, still haven't told anyone I know about it. I also already have a plan for how I will kill myself and can do it anytime as I live alone in a dorm room.

I just don't want it to be awkward or to get put in the hospital as my school year is almost over and I have a bunch of school work I have to finish."

"Overheard my mom talking shit about me on the phoneI canât say Iâm surprised. As soon as we get into a fight (or even in the days after), she always feels the need to call people up and tell them how âawfulâ and âselfishâ I am. She just loves making people feel bad for her and making herself out to be the victim. 

Hereâs the part I heard (talking about me): â(My name) just wants me to spend the rest of my life alone, and she doesnât care about my feelings.â 

Why did she say this you might ask? Because I told her it was pretty shitty of her to leave me at home alone all weekend every weekend (and sometimes during the week) when I was 15, so that she could go visit my (soon to be ex) stepdad. He lives 1.5 hours away, so itâs not like she could just come home if I needed her. I was completely and utterly alone so many times, and wasnât even old enough to drive. Also, this took place only a year after my father committed suicide and went on for maybe a little more than a year. 

Apparently me pointing out how badly that hurt me is âbeing selfish and wanting her to be alone for the rest of her life.â No, you fucking dumbass. Itâs just kinda hard being 15 and being abandoned by your only parent right after the suicide of your other one. I think anyone with half a brain and at least some love for their child could see that. 

Whenever I bring it up, she blames me or deflects to something else. In the past, she was pretty physically abusive and I can recall her choking me on two separate occasions, and sheâs hit me more times than I can count. Sheâs constantly insulting me and tearing me down, and Iâm sick of it. 

Iâm just done. My dad was the best parent when he was well. He was such a good man. And now Iâm left with this uncaring drama queen of a mom whose whole life revolves around having a pity party for herself and not giving a shit about anyone but herself. 

The only thing keeping me alive right now is the fact Iâll be 18 this month. When I turn 18, Iâm going to inherit a decent amount of money left to me from my grandpa. My mom told me that I should give her the money to help her with her divorce right now, and sheâll pay me back later. Well, thatâs not fucking happening. Iâm taking the money, and Iâm leaving to go somewhere. I canât be around this toxic woman anymore. Maybe once I blow through it Iâll take my life, but weâll just have to see. 

And if I do take my life, Iâll make a detailed account of all the horrible things she did that contributed to my suicide so that everyone will know how awful she truly is. That way she wonât be able to milk it for more pity either. What a heartless bitch.

"I regret so many decisions I take..I just don't think I can trust myself with decisions anymore. I think about the decision quite a bit before taking it
.. then I realise I should've thought more about it but only when it's too late. I broke down and cried for a long time today, which is not something that usually happens(usually I do cry alot but it felt way different this time). There's a person that has hurt me alot but everytime they do hurt me it always feels like a ""that's it I hate this person now"" moment but after some time I realise maybe it was me that hurt them and that made them hurt me in return.. and alot of times I act out of emotion when they do hurt me and it's almost guaranteed at this point that I do regret it. I can never seem to remember the bad things people have done to me... only remember the good times we've had which just keeps adding to the pain. I just wish I hated them so badly at this point.. but I can't."
how do i get rid of these god fucking damned pimples lmao

"I donât really feel like life is worth livingFor some people it is. Some people have great lives Iâm sure. Some people have amazing friends or they found their soul mate. I have nothing and no one. I have my daughter who would be better off without me. I have a husband who just picked a fight with me before he left for work because I was feeling depressed and he apparently âjust wants me to be happyâ and he thinks getting mad at me for being sad is the right way to make me happy. Heâs not my soul mate but Iâm stuck because my family wonât take me back at this point. We just got married last year and I have a baby. I donât have a job Iâm waiting on state approval for child care assistance.

So I left everything that I know behind to move in with my husband. I moved 800 miles away from my family. At the time I didnât even want to be with him I was just so desperate to get out of my familyâs home because I was so unimportant to them. I was so lonely and depressed. Even now I have no one not a single soul I can call to talk. My parents would never understand my sister and I donât talk about these things none of my âfriendsâ answer the phone when I call and never call me back when I ask.

I have no one Iâve always been alone. No one even wants to be my friend god knows I donât have a fucking soul mate. I want to kill myself because my baby will be better off. I donât want to be in this relationship anymore but I canât leave. I donât have anyone or anything to offer the world. Even if I could leave my marriage I would never find anyone else to love me the way I want to be loved. I canât even find a friend that truly loves me. I just want to end it all and get it over with. I tried to kill myself at 15 but I failed and I didnât try again because I hoped things would get better. I wish I could go back and tell myself that it never gets any fucking better"

"My friend is having thoughts of suicide after a bad breakup. She has no one to talk to except me. How can I help her?(Throwaway account because I don't want my friend to find this, because I'm scared she would stop talking to me if she knew)

Some background: My friend and I are in college and have been friends since 7th grade.  She has had a history of depression (she is on medication, she recently switched to a new one a couple of weeks ago, I don't know if she is having a negative reaction to it or not) since I have known her.  She was once in the hospital for trying to OD, and she has also dealt with anorexia.

My friend started a relationship with an older man at the beginning of fall, which ended one week ago. This relationship had been kept secret from her family (she did not tell them because they are very conservative and would not have accepted her if they knew) and most of her friends. She tells me that I am the only one that she totally trusts and who she can tell everything. The breakup has been very hard for her as she has been having to hold her feelings in while she is at home, unable to tell anyone but me. I have been talking to her on the phone a lot, as it is difficult for me to go and visit her. I have been trying to console her about the relationship, and trying to give her advice. I thought that out talks had improved her mood.

However, early this morning she called me crying, saying that she was going to kill herself and she had a suicide note ready (which she said she would send to her ex). She said she was going to call the suicide hotline but decided to call me instead.  Despite my advice, she has been talking to her ex, which have only made things worse and have got her to this state.  I have told her before to cut contact with him but she still loves him.  Her ex was many 'firsts' for her - she lost her virginity with him, and this was her first serious relationship.  She now feels 'tainted' for losing her virginity to him. After talking to her and calming her down, she says that she won't commit suicide because she ""won't get answers"" from him is she did. I have tried to tell her before that she should try not to dwell, and that she probably won't get all of the answers that she wants from him; she can't get in his head.  I am really worried that she will try to get all of the answers she wants and not try to move on. I am scared that she will be suicidal again. She does not have the money to see a therapist, however she does go to free counseling while she is at school.  She doesn't want to go back to school because it only reminds her of her ex. I don't know what more I can do to help her."

"Drug cravings and living in a shitholeMy life is a bad cartoon, that is the only reasonable explanation, I am craving drugs so bad right now I am shaking and my body feels âthirstyâ I feel like my skin is crawling all over and I want to throw up. I also live in a house with 5 roommates. And we all share two bedroom, I share a bedroom with three other people. Iâm literally crying because of how much I miss inhalants, but instead I have to lie and say I am crying about my cat (who got hit on the road last week) fuck this shit, I hate myself, I want to just get High and sleep all day, I want to get High until I forget to eat and die, that would be the worldâs greatest way to go out"
"I wish nobody would careI wish that nobody would care if I died. The only reason other than my cowardice that I won't kill myself is that I don't want to be even more of a burden. It would make death so much easier if people just wouldn't even notice. Because I wish I could be done with people and the world and everything that fucking messes with me. The world always seems to trick me into being happy for half a day, then rubs shit in my face for a week.
I've never cut myself, so nobody thinks I need help, but I never cut myself because physical pain never actually hurt me. I'm always insulting myself, making myself cry, then I'm pretending I'm fine. I can't go on like that. I can't live like this anymore, and I'm too much of a coward to kill myself or ask for help. What am I supposed to do? Wait for my Prince charming? As if.
The reason I'm posting this is that I can't bottle this stuff up anymore. I did it so much that I'm pretty sure I'm making myself go insane. There's so much in my head that even I don't know what secrets I'm keeping. 
Now that I've considerably rambled, sorry for ruining your day and I hope you're not on this sub because you're like me or worse than me. &lt;3"
"It's never going to get betterI'm so lonely and alone. I'm a lesbian and I will never get a girlfriend. I'm sick of being treated as a fetish for heterosexual couples for threesomes. I'm sick of feeling so alone. I have no one like me. I hate online dating because it never works. Meeting someone irl is fucking hard for a lesbian. I don't want to be sexualised, I want to be seen as a human before a lesbian. My parents are homophobic. My friends betrayed me. I'm lost and alone and no will accept me.

I'm just so sad. I want to cry. There's no one. Everyone treats me like shit because I'm a lesbian. It's never going to get better. I want to fucking die. "
"My latest philosophy.. Dont hate people. Whether you hate a racist, sexist, misandrist, misogynist, rapist, murderer, or anybody else. You hate them for their ignorance. 

The racist may genuinely that he isnt a bad person. He believes that he's the good one. He may genuinely believe that black people are inherently bad. While this isnt true, why does he believe it? His environment. His environment shaped him to how is is today. What he's learned from the media, his parents, his encounters with black people, ect. He isnt in control of his environment. It's not his fault that he's racist. If he wouldve grown up in a different family, he probably wouldn't of been racist. It has nothing to do with his brain, and everything to do with his environment. Racism isn't inherent. Its ignorance that's taught. Something you have no control over being taught. Because you lack perspective. If you had that real perspective and yet you still grew up in that environment, you would choose to not be racist. Most people dont understand how shaped we are by our environments. All of our thoughts. All of our descions. Our life choices. They stemmed from our environment. An environment we didnt choose. It's not our fault that we have those thoughts. So noone should hate us for them. At the least, they should feel sorry for is. At the most, they should try their best to educate us. Once you realize this, that people are products of their environments. That who they are isnt their fault. All of the hate you have will leave your heart. 

Now, this isnt to say that you should just handle every situation with a bad person like ""i'm better than you,"" so you're still feeling good at the end of the day. That's an ego problem. Another issue for another time. 

And this doesnt mean that you aren't responsible for making strides to change your life. To become better. To change your environment. This isnt a free pass to just be an uncrafted person. Yes, you have to hit the perfect and exact pillars (bits of knowledge) in order to want to change your life and actually do it. Whether you get those or not is entirely based on your environment. But truthfully you probably have pieces of those pillars already, most people do. This post isnt meant for you to disregard those pillars and just stay how you are. If anything, its meant to encourage you to do the opposite. Push and change to become better. Go for it. Stop hating people. Theres no valid reason to."

"I'm so tiredthe past three weeks ive had so many days where i actually didn't think I would make it out alive. it doesn't help that I'm undiagnosed with my mental illness(es) and I don't have any professional help because I cant afford it. Today I had my first ever session with a free (sponsored) therapist and she asked me to talk about things about myself that I liked and I couldn't think of anything. I spent 30 mins trying to come up with things and she kept saying these are all things you dislike. Well, that's the point. 

A girl in my college committed suicide a few months ago. My situation isnt nearly as bad as hers in terms of financial stability, social standing, etc but I keep thinkingâ i get it. I don't see a way out. It would be so much easier if I wasn't around. truly. what would I miss out on? The positives of life? Theyre too few and far between to be worth all this pain. Ive been lying in bed crying for two hours my head hurts nothing is worth this."
"Thank yâall for keeping my ass aliveYâall mfs really care. Iâm 14M (nearin 15) and just started really getting better and happier or at least less suicidal and depressed and stopped cutting after being in a really dark place. I tried to stab myself to death but passed out before I could finish it and I always said I would never regret suicide (or attempting it) and I donât, necessarily, but I am glad Iâm still here bc even though it wasnât worth the suffering, Iâm better now. My parents donât give a fuck. My girl dumped my ass. I woke up in a pool of sticky, brownish blood and no one had even bothered to open the goddamn door to my room and see why I hadnât left my room by 2pm and it didnât get better right away. It never will, especially not all at once, but it could always get better (as well as worse). I was lucky I guess but I think I owe my survival mostly to my few real ass friends and yâall here on r/SuicideWatch. Thank yâall for keeping my sorry ass alive long enough to get better. Even though it wasnât worth it to have suffered all that shit just to be happy ish now and maybe even happy fo real in my future (that I have thanks to yâall and my friends), i am glad Iâm here and pretty happy now. So quarantine has been a crazy motherfuckin ride. Thank yâall again for helping me out. Iâve finally started the path to recovery and I hope to have some updates on my mental health and possibly self harm (and hopefully lack thereof) if anything worth posting happens"
"Kid thought ""poggers"" was racist So the other day, a kid at my school claimed that ""poggers"" was a racial slur, and slang for slave. Like this kid went all out, told his friends, parents etc. Someone actually had to say, to his face, that poggers wasn't a racist term. I don't know where he got this from, he just started saying it one day."
"I want to end my life. I want it to end. I don't care anymore. Funny considering how I had a religious crisis at the beginning of the summer. How I was scared of death. I'm not scared of it anymore. I welcome it. Anything can be better than this. Anything. I'll take Hell. Maybe this is Hell. Feels like it. Every day is the exact same, nothing is fun anymore. My best friend is fading away, I know he is. I'm tired of seeing everyone live the life I want. I'm tired of being a nothing and being ignored. If I were to end my life, you know what would happen? No more jealously, anger, embarrassment. None of it. It'd be bliss. Pure fucking bliss. I just wish I wasn't too much of a pussy to do it."
Almost 22 with nothing to look forward toIâm 21 and I have no purpose. Iâm not nice to look at. Iâm not good at anything. I was considered âgiftedâ as a kid and it turns out I really donât have a gift. I want to enjoy things. I want to get my curiosity back. But Iâm really bad at everything Iâve ever tried. Iâm getting mediocre grades at a mediocre school. I donât have any close friends. I got fired from a bullshit part time job. I have no use to the world. I have no purpose. I graduate in a few months and I have no plans and I have had no internships and Iâm not even interested in my major. All my friends are doing so well and I have to pretend to be happy for them while I lay around and give up on my life. Iâm going to kill myself before I turn 22 in May. Any tips on how to make this hurt my close knit and caring family less? I hurt them a lot by being alive and not being happy or successful but Iâm so afraid that my death will tear them apart. I love them so much but Iâm sick of being the family disappointment and I donât think there is anything I can do to fix my life. I am almost 22 and havenât done anything to mold a career of a life path for myself. There is no hope for me. My future is so bleak and I think it might hurt my family less to end it now rather than be a burden and a beacon of shame forever. But I really donât want to hurt them at all.

"Dealing with a miscarriage, sexual assault &amp; a breakupI'm not feeling stable right now. Recently I was sexually assaulted, my ex broke up with me after not being able to comit to a long term relationship (further making me feel suicidal bc of the implications that had along side being assaulted), and recently, my pharmacist and I confirmed my suspicions that I most likely miscarried.

I'm already off my meds because of complications with my doctors office so I'm feeling really unstable, I keep trying to process everything and I can't and I don't know who to talk to. Every time My stomach squeezes in pain, everytime I stand in the shower and watch another thick clot come out I'm reminded of the trauma I have been through recently.

I'm supposed to talk about things with my ex tomorrow, he's still someone I care about and don't want to lose but I can't do it. He just reminds me of what I had and lost - his kid, him, his presence in my life. I can barely eat, nothing brings me joy, I can barely get out of bed and on my way to work today I snapped - everything was a method of killing myself. Tree branches, cars, aggressive looking men - I just needed that single push. I live by a river right now and I can't swim. I'm tempted to get rip roaring drunk and high and just drown. 

I'm not okay but I have people counting on me. I should be admitted but how? How do I make the process of admitting myself easier? I can't keep living like this I'm reaching my tipping point."

"I really wanna dieAll I do is hurt those I love, drove one of my friends insane (he used to be very mentally stable... I destroyed him...) I became obsessed with him, I'm terrified of losing him, I'm in love with him and he used to have mutual feelings until my disorder fucked everything up, I can't live if I lose him. I cant stop it I've gone completly insane myself. I never thought i was able of killing but 2 days ago i decapitated 2 goldfish... I need to kill myself before I do something worse than that. Im just a fucking BPD piece of trash anyway.

I live in canada so i have little to no access to things that are lethal.. The mental health care quality is garbage, I've been at an all time low I'm constantly self harming, someone please help me find a way to end my life as quickly as possible. I am extremly poor too... I can't hang myself since i have nothing to hang from in my appartment. Ive tried meds overdose countless times but failed each time, I want to die. Please. Ive been living this hell for 20 years soon 21, please help me end it all. For the sake of the people around me and myself... I beg you"

so walk out the door like everyone else and give up, because its apparent to me now im a lost cause. i hurt you and thats the one thing i promise i wouldnt do and i fucking ruined it due to my fucking bullshit. i want to fucking die. i want you to stop hurting. me dying would stop you from hurting anymore. so just dump me like c did and leave me to die alone like i deserve. find a nice pretty girl that has a perfect body and a healthy mind, and lives close to you so you can actually get what you need from her. im not suitable, i fucking failed my objective. it was to save you and protect you. and all i did was fuck it up. and thats unforgivable in my eyes. im unforgivable. i want to fucking die because of it. i want to fucking die. i dont know what the fuck is stopping me right now. i think its only because i want to hear it come out of your mouth. tell me that you want me gone, and i will be. tell me to go die, and i will. tell me how horrible and selfish and fucked up i am, and ill agree with you. im completely in the wrong just like i always have been, and thats why i deserve to apologize all the time. i wish andy would have ended up killing me or fucking me up to a point where life wasnt possible anymore. anything but me doing all of this to myself. 

i fucking love you. more than the air i breathe, more than the soul that occupies this shell of a body, more than every fiber of my being, more than what this universe can hold. more than LIFE. i fucked you up, and im sorry. i always said your exes were the most fucked up, when really its me. im the ultimate fuck up, and no one has managed to ruin things like i have. i knew it was a matter of time before i fucked it all up. im sorry. sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry. and no matter how many times i say it or how much i mean it itll never be good enough for you. and thats how it should be because im a piece of shit that deserves to die. no one wants me. not c, not my family, none of the people that called themselves my friends, society, the world-so why not you, since you were all that i had left. you were my everything, and i let you down and broke my promises. i deserve nothing better than to brutally die and decompose under the dirt and be left to be forgotten. i hold nothing against you. this is all towards me. nobody else messed up or did this to me, this is my fucking fault. i shouldnt have even been born-that was a literal mistake too. not succeeding every time ive attempted suicide was my fault and was a mistake as well. im your biggest mistake. and i fucking hate myself for it. i dont know what im going to do about this. i dont deserve your forgiveness or empathy or anything else from you at all. i deserve nothing, and i deserve to be nothing. its a sin to hurt someone like you, and ive done it multiple times. i just need to die. i was never meant to stay in this world for that long, anyways. its been made clear that this world just doesnt want me, no matter how hard i try to not fuck up. try to accept my apologies someday, try to get beyond my heartlessness and foolishness. just forget about me, and let me disappear. 

i'm done. fucking done. im done trying to help people. im done trying to find true love. im done disappointing everyone. im done fucking up. im done not getting better. im done breaking things. im done hurting everyone. im done being a burden. im done being a waste. im done being hated. im done being abandoned. im done being crazy. im done being tired. im done breaking down. im done being broken hearted. im done lying. im done being lied to. im done trying to fit in. im done re-inventing myself. im done trying to survive. im done wanting to live. im done trying to be a good person when i know im not. im done trying to keep control of myself. im done losing my most prized things in life. im done trying to be happy. im done trying to be ideal. im done trying to be smart. im done trying to be important. im done trying to be worthy. im done trying to be talented. im done trying to get sober. im done trying to stop cutting. im done losing friends. im done crying. im done bleeding. im done laying alone and cold at night. im done being the most unwanted person on the planet. im done hating myself. im done trying to keep holding on. im done hoping. im done thinking im going to be saved. im done thinking that this is only temporary. im done sinking to new lows. im done fucking everything up for everone. im done trying to change myself. im done at trying to recover. im done being depressed. im done being delusional. im done being bipolar. im done with me.

"i really don't know what to doso life has been pretty shitty for me since last year with all this stress and pressure that just gets put on me, i started getting suicidal thoughts like mid 2019 and i almost took my own life 6 months ago but i just couldn't, i don't know what it was but i just couldn't i recently got into a relationship at that time and my girlfriend has been trying to help me with depression and i tried talking to my parents and they just ignored it, i literally had a mental breakdown in front of them because of the pressure they put on me and didn't even acknowledged the fact i have depression, sometimes i feel like they don't even care about me and just care about how i make them look, i just started high school and its already super stressful and i've been trying and trying but they just keep going after me for every little mistake i make they took away everything that ever made me happy and i cant even talk to the only person who has been helping me with this, everyday i just want it to end i just want someone to put me out of my misery but at the same time i don't want to leave this all behind i honestly don't even know what to do."

I always wanted to kiss a girl... I really did... I've loved a lot of women but no woman ever loved me, and I don't blame them. No woman *can* love me. I was made to be raped and tortured and hated. But I can't live this life. I've tried for years to come to terms with the fact that I'm inherently unlovable but I can't bear it anymore."

"I just want my family backI thought I had a perfect family. I thought my marriage was perfect. I wouldn't have traded it for the world. But it turns out my wife has been pretending everything is okay for several months and it has finally become too much for her. She is leaving me with no opportunity for me to try and fix what was wrong. She considers the months of her hiding her feelings ""trying"" and says we have already tried. We have a daughter that I haven't been able to control crying around. Every time I see her it reminds me that I'm not going to be waking her up or school anymore. The idea of losing my family is too much to bear. I don't hate my wife. I don't want to lose her. She's my best and only friend. Now she looks at me as if she's hated me for years and I feel so alone and empty. She was everything to me. I could talk to her about anything and I thought she could do the same but she was hiding how she truly felt. I just want to wake up from this and find out it was all a horrible nightmare.

I've wanted to die so much since she told me there was no way to fix this. I don't want to live my life without my best friend. She won't even just talk to me like a friend. I just want her to give me a hug and let me hold her the way I used to. Right now the closest thing I have to a friend is a 6 year old concerned about her daddy crying so much. I think if it weren't for her I'd have already killed myself. I planned to shoot myself yesterday, but I couldn't think of a way to do it without traumatizing anyone. The idea of my daughter or wife finding me and having to witness that made that impossible. 

I don't know what to do. I never even remotely thought this was a possibility in our marriage. We've been together for almost 10 years and they have been the happiest 10 years of my life. Not without struggles, but years I would never give up. I'm so fucking alone."

"Struggled with suicidal ideation since I was about 8, pretty much see no point in living any more.I really just see point in living. Nothing fulfills me or makes me happy. Nothing goes right for me. Every time I get into a relationship it goes great and gets my hopes up, and then crashes and burns and leaves me feeling 10x worse than if I was just lonely and depressed like before. I think a lot about just calling up my ""girlfriend"" and killing myself (I doubt she'd even answer her phone). I just am in a state of constant emotional suffering and see no point to living, when 99% of it is either monotony or going through an outright painful experience. It doesn't help that my ""girlfriend"" who I've been seeing since June and lives not 15 minutes away from me never talks to me or makes any attempt to see me. I see her maybe once every 4-8 weeks, if I'm lucky, after I ask her a bunch of times. This wasn't the case at first, but it has been since about August. 

I am just so exhausted emotionally. I'm tired of nothing good happening. I'm tired of constant loneliness and suffering. I just want put a bullet in my head."
"I'm feeling really sad and I can't stop it.I know this is long, I'm sorry in advance.

Every night, when I lie down to go to sleep, I think about a night with my mom when I was really little (Probably 5 or 6) where something mildly inconvenient happened to me and I said I was gonna kill myself (I obviously wasn't serious, just cranky and annoyed). She slapped me really hard and told me never to say that again for any reason and sent me to bed.

I'm 30 now and I think about suicide every single day. I want to tell her, but the trauma from that moment is burned into my brain and I choke up. I'm not sure she'd care. It seems natural for your mom to care, but mine is pretty disconnected from me and kind of one of those ""depression is just sadness that you need to get over, therapy won't help"" types. Also, very anti-meds. My dad is.. ..No. He absolutely doesn't care. My friends care a ton, but it doesn't help. It doesn't feel like anything I do helps.

I play Minecraft a lot. Thousands of hours building by myself, not talking to anyone. Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Rune Factory. Any game I can mentally escape into for at least a few hours, I'll get and I'll put hundreds of hours into it. The second I stop, I start crying because I feel like I'm breaking down every minute and I don't know what to do. I feel like my heart is a glass ball and every day, the crack gets a liiiiittle longer. I know that if I go to therapy or get anti-depressants, my mom will be on my back about it and make getting better 100x worse than bottling it up, even though I know it's not healthy. I can't handle more criticism or yelling about even more I'm doing wrong, if that makes sense. I wanted to wait until I move out, I'm working on that right now, but it's so hard and it feels like I can't really take it.. All of my friends are online, so the second I leave my laptop to do anything, I feel soul-crushing loneliness. And yeah, I tried making friends IRL. It doesn't work for me, I don't like people being around me, it feels like people are staring and I just.. it makes me really uncomfortable. This is a lot better for me. It helps.

I used to cut myself on my legs, but my mom noticed and complained about me being clumsy (She just assumed I fell) and I knew that eventually, she'd figure it out and it would cause me more arguments and problems, so I just stopped.

The ONLY thing keeping me from doing it at this point is that I promised my friends I wouldn't and the last thing I need is for their last memory of me to be that of a liar, I guess.. But I think about it every single day and I don't know what to do. I cry every night and when people aren't around. I like to sing for myself and people assume that if I'm singing and laughing and having a good time, I'm happy. I'm not happy. I haven't been happy in like.. 10 years or so, maybe? I'm exhausted all the time just from being alive. I wake up every morning sort of.. disappointed? Annoyed..? I don't know the word, it's just not.. a good feeling. I don't really have any dreams anymore, I keep expecting to die before the year is up and no one wants to hear that. I'm a downer and I know I am. I don't know what I should do..

I'm sorry if this is too long. I started rambling and I figured I might as well get it all out at once while I could, I guess. Thanks in advance for any advice or support, anything is good. &lt;3"

i donât think people realize how much of myself i give. they donât get that everything i do is just so exhausting because it takes so much out of me. no one gets that iâm trying my hardest but i just canât seem to get it together. 

im trying so hard but iâve been suicidal since i was like 7 years old. eventually it just weighs down on you and takes over everything

"Ive been feeling down for a very long time about my break up and dont know what to do anymoreI had a girl friend for 5 years that I loved to the end of the world and same for her. Long story short, we wanted different things for our future and thought it was better to break up now then do it 5 more years down the line. It ended well at first but then we kept in contact and it got progressively worse until it ended like a terrible brake up. 

Ive been try the dating scene online. I have a weird personality that most probably dont like, I dont like to dance, crowds bother me after a while, I'm shy, I'm an introvert. This has always depressed me; especially because my brother is the complete opposite and meets new people all the time. 

So I finally connected with someone that wanted to grab drinks with me. She had seen my photos online prior to giving me her number. The day of meeting each other, she asked me to snap chat each other which I agreed. I sent her one of me, which looks exactly like my profile picture, she opened it and never responded; unmatched us in the dating app and never texted me back. 

I got stood up after all this, after she saw a photo of me. I feel more alone then ever, more depressed than ever; and my suicidal thoughts are coming back. I feel like ill never find someone. 

I just want to talk to people and get my mind off things; is there a website that people go to, to just have conversations about anything? Not expecting a hook up but to have 1 on 1 conversations? "
"red flag w this girl? posted again due to no helpful advice

This mornings things were going great like our convo, we were both responding fast etc. For reference I knew her for a month now

So when I came home I did my thing and snapped her and she replied in a fair time but her snap was just a black screen with no text. My snap was glitching at the time and sometimes people's snaps just show up as a black screen. This happened before and she told me it was a glitch

So I asked her if she sent me a black screen or if it's a glitch again. It's been 3 hours now and hasn't responded I'm beginning to think I did something but I didn't do anything

Between these times she's like always online so idk what happened any advice ?

Okay she responded just now but i feel weird opening a snap which she took 3 hours to reply..."

(Iâm safe and not doing anything) I just get these thoughts of putting a gun to my head more and more. Iâm not suicidal but concerned. Help?Iâve been having insane anger issues this last year especially. I have this reoccurring thought of putting a gun to my right temple and pulling the trigger. Always the same thought. Never anything different. A year ago I had the key to my gun cabinet in my had ready to pull out a pistol but put it back and cried and didnât tell anyone. I tried therapy online and going to try telehealth with a real therapy office. Iâm just so full of anger and it feels like everything I succeed at I need to fight tooth and nail. It feels like everyoneâs out to get me and Iâve had to stand up for myself to often recently. People have tried to talk down to me and I corrected them and blocked them from my life. I need the least amount of stress possible and need to be treated with respect that I wasnât given or even able to talk with these people Iâve had issues. Iâm just scared about this reoccurring thought because I donât want to kill my self I have a lot of great things in my life. I am just depressed and itâs hard to enjoy all the bright things and successes when youâre getting kicked while youâre down whenever possible. Any thoughts?

"it's been a while...i've had suicidal ideation since I was 8.  periodically, i find myself looking back and regretting not following through.  now is one of those times, at 36.

my life is good.  i have a good job, in a career that i am bored of, quite frankly, but will always be profitable (programmer).  and i earn good money: i'm at 120k, up from 40k when i started, 10 years ago.

i'm also single and getting in good shape.  down from 400lb to 230lb, and look more built than pudgy, tho i'm honestly still pudgy.  i couldn't see inflicting the let-down on anyone else.  

my apartment is suitable and close to the beach.  i live in los angeles.  objectively, i'm at a good jump point for where ever i want to go and whatever i want to do.  i haven't been able to pursue relationships because of body image and high standards.  i won't be with someone i'm not physically attracted to, and 80% of those that i meet have obvious compatibility issues.

i'm unfortunately red pill indoctrinated, which is a mixed blessing if you can get past the misogyny inherently at risk in the demographic.

i simply don't know how to enjoy any of this.  i'm too angry.  everything has been a fight.  i've had to fight to lose weight.  i've had to fight to build my career.  

i'm just tired and i don't want to work at this any more.  the show hasn't been even mildly good to begin with.  why allow this world to drag me through the rest of it?

my mind is often infantile in it's hostility and feels so disconnected from who i actually consider myself to be.  i hear voices i can't control and can only ignore with great effort.  they run the gamut, and cover all areas of human interaction, feed my hopes or fears, but are not me and not about me.  there are times when i get such anxiety i feel like i'm having a heart attack and all i can think is ""i hope this one takes me out.""

when i try to pursue my dreams, i find i cannot concentrate nor follow through.  it's always ""too hard"".  i use to consider myself intelligent.  now i feel like my intelligence is little more than a mist that i only periodically feel as i'm walking through it.  disconnected.  difficult to direct.  i suppose this has gotten better since the sleep apnea has been reduced.

i don't want relationships, i don't think.  i don't want to love and have it ripped from me.  i don't have faith that it'll ever be less than a nightmare of fights, or worse a betrayal of love.  i don't have faith that i won't end up yelling and face my own recriminations later.  i don't have any reason for faith.  ever relationship i've ever seen looks like a nightmare to me.  i don't see why anyone tries.

i don't want to get better.
i just want this over.

it's just been a nightmare of social and personal inadequacy and i'm exhausted from trying to improve."

"Suicidal - need adviceWhen I was little, I always thought that people who committed suicide were depressed and sad and angry.

I'm grown up now, and I want to commit suicide, but I am neither sad nor angry nor depressed. I just am. I don't see a reason for living. (Is anything wrong with me?) I don't want to increase other people's burden by making them provide for me, and I don't want to provide for myself. Suicide seems like the perfect option.

Why am I not dead yet?
I don't really see a way to commit suicide. 

People keep telling me feeling suicidal is a bad thing, but is it? Should I commit suicide? If so, how? Any advice would help. "

"I just want to die all the timeI already posted a similar topic on the confessions but I thought I might get a little help here, so Iâll post another one here and see where it will take me. 

So 8 months ago I attempted suicide. I tried to OD on medications I was required to take. I donât know whatâs wrong with me. I think Iâm just really good at lying to myself and everyone around me. I lied to myself when I was taken to the psychiatric hospital that I was normal and I was pretty darn convinced I was, which when I got released I was so happy to live. I went to therapy a few times which I lasted maybe 3 months and then I quit because I didnât have time and it became a stressful thing rather a helping thing. 
Fast forward to now, I started to get bad anxiety and depression again from this relationship Iâm in. My boyfriend and I are on and off with our relationship but currently on a break due to my anxiety getting bad again. Some days I canât breathe and I feel like my lungs are collapsing. And those are the times when I really wish Iâd stop breathing right now. Thereâs always an suicidal thought in my head. Like thereâs a way out of this misery but after my first attempt, I couldnât handle how my mom and my dad would be if I did die, so now Iâm here living but with no real reason and direction. Everyday is hard. But then not only hard and was difficult to deal with, at the kitchen I work at, this 50 year old man is harassing me by trying to flirt with me and stuff. I donât know what to do with it but everyone around me is helping me take action on it which is powering me. And making me stronger. 

Iâm sorry I really donât know what Iâm talking about. Iâm a 19F and Iâm lost in life. I wish I never woke up that day. I have social anxiety and I hate people. I detach myself from everyone who cares about me but I need someone by me constantly. I always have a thought in my head that wants to die. I have really no reason to live. Maybe itâs too much for me. "

"A weird thing happened once To give a little context in my country schools have uniforms and u don't go to classes the teachers come to your class kind of like in a university, the classes are continuous but teachers take time to come to the class like 2-3 mins.

So I was in 11th and one day I was just coming back from the washroom and while I was coming I was noticing that a girl was standing with her friends at the door of the class and while I was going towards the class she started looking at me and not how I  looked at my crush, she was straight away  staring and I reached near her I was standing in front of her and she was looking (in my eyes) at me I made a weird face kinda confused and went to my seat.

She is the hottest girl in my class and all of 11th grade I have had other weird interactions with her heck we don't even share a common friend. Currently I cant have any interactions with her because of some reasons we started conducting classes online and everybody stopped going out of the house. I have no idea why tho.

What do u think was on her mind?"

Don't know how much longer I can take feeling like this.  Nothing seems to be going right in my life.  I feel like I am at my breaking point and if nothing changes by tomorrow around this time I have to build up the courage to go ahead and end this pain.  Sorry to vent on here but I have absolutely noone to talk to no friends or anything.  I've tried calling the hotline but it seems that I get put on hold for long periods then keep getting the same guy who seems to rush me off the phone but I guess if I keep getting him he must volunteer a lot and is overwhelmed.  Meds and therapy haven't worked other than to drain my pockets dry. I have lost all hope and don't want to be in this pain anymore.

"I miss my Christmas Past Yesterday I had a session with my therapist through video phone, and she spotted my fully decorated Christmas tree in the background. She loved it, and I got excited to show her Christmas cards I wrote for my friends as well as art crafts. I told her about Christmas movies I've been watching the past week and my plans for this month. She was very impressed at how much festive I am and I inspired her to do the same thing. She then had to ask a question in particular.

Am I depressed? No, but I told her I'm sad instead. I grew up in Germany with my mother and we got to experience several things such as Weihnachtsmarkt, Saint Nicholas Day, warmth and love from everyone, hanging out with friends, etc. When we were little kids, local restaurant owners used to give us a basket of free desserts after school on the way to home. We absolutely loved Christmas.

8 years ago, we had to move to the US just to live with my dad and older sister before my mother's death shortly afterwards. Everything was new to me and I was lost. My Christmas wasn't the same anymore and my dad doesn't know German traditions. He was fine for the first few years before he became obsessed with fake women online and drink a lot. My sister used to do hard drugs and she drinks a lot just like our dad. I lost more relatives and friends in between 2012 and today. They wallow in darkness for a long time, and my dad got an absolute crap tree. I couldn't stand the sight of it for a few years, so I ended up buying my own Christmas tree for my bedroom last month.

I wanted to do something about it to keep up with my Christmas spirit even if it isn't the same as my days back in Germany. We always loved it, and I would like to keep up with traditions even if she's gone. This is probably stupid, but I don't feel like I want to speak English in person anymore for this month. I want to speak German like I'm back at home, but guess it's impossible now. I miss Germany and everything."
"am i too young to feel this hopeless?i'm 19 and already disappointed in everything. i don't believe in the healing power of love, the possibility of financial success and being content with your career... i don't see any way how the world can offer me something exciting. some people are scared of wasting their life but i feel like i just have to sit still until it ends - i don't think there's such thing as ""wasting time"" because every second is a burden. the only moments i truly enjoy are when i'm with my mom or friends, but they can't dedicate their lives trying to help me or be here for me always, they have dreams of their own...while mine are dead.

i just wish i had a desire of being alive, a lust for life. i don't know if i don't because the world is fucked up or my brain is, or both."

"Social AnxietyI'm 19 years old and I've had social anxiety disorder in 6 years. It all  started in secondary school. I've always been afraid of being judged. I didn't practice to any test in all these years. It kept the pressure away, yet I still got decent grades. Before every presentation, standing in front of the whole class I was dying inside. Just getting over with that was a big relief. I was scared weeks before a presentation thinking the worst. It might last for 2 minutes, but that didn't stop me worrying. I also never ate anything at school, the judging...

I finished school, I'm and apprentice/trainee whatever it is in english. I'm working a lot, earning a lot of money. At average 2000-2500 euros a month. But instead of being outside drinking my depressions away, I gamble all my money. And it gets even more depressing and everything. I'm not concerned about my gambling. I know I can handle it if I cared about life. I have no joy in life. 2-3 friends, but mostly chatting. I usually decline every time they want to do something social outside.

I'm scared of step outside my house. Just going to the store kill me inside. My parents just thinks I'm shy, of course I usually just hide on my room. I'm even to scared to take the driver license. I know I can drive a car, I've practised with my father. But I want to avoid the exam, sitting in the car with another man's judgement. Wow, I'm to scared to even think of it. 

And I'm still not fully educated to my job, I will probably fail the qualifying examination and then what? My social anxiety is too strong for me, I'm bored all the time. I don't care about my money. I want a life. Probably I will kill myself before the examination next year. I would be dead already if it wasn't for my dog. Surely my best friend. I find no light, I've so many problems. Anxiety, depressions whatever. Probably more names to my problems that I can't name. I know I need help, but I'm to scared to ask. I'm lost. My life is all about working hard in my job, sleep and gamble. Wow what a life. If I can't step outside without being scared, whats even the point of being alive?

And sorry for my english, I know it's shit."
"i think i should be hereI put this in r/depression but maybe it goes here instead..

I am scared of myself. I am hallucinating and I'm scared of what is happening. Please can someone talk to me and help me anchor into reality. I have been depressed my whole life and it never gets better. I don't have anything to offer or look forward to or be proud of. I hate myself, I know people say that a lot but I really do. I'm just very afraid and alone and depressed. I've tried everything (meds, therapy, psychiatrists, books, websites, food, exercise) nothing works except getting wasted and that's only until I wake up again. I don't know how it would ever get better. I used to be optimistic but now it's become impossible. Every day all I can do to get through it is take enough meds that I'm just crying a lot but don't do anything about it but I'm daring myself to just end it more and more every day. I really don't know how much longer I can last.

my brain has always been wrong for my whole life and made me see things and made me sad and I am weird and different and I don't belong anywhere. A lot people have hurt me in very,very bad ways and made me weaker. and weaker and I have been trapped under rock bottom for years now. I have been through a lot of sad things that are hard for me to say and would be hard for you to read. I feel like I'm living a nightmare. My future right now is also very, very bleak. I honestly don't think I can face it.

"I know Iâm going to do it one dayIâm gonna kill myself, probably in about ten years. My wife smokes so sheâll probably be dead by then, as soon as sheâs gone and my parents are gone Iâm going to do it. Iâm taking care not to make any new relationships so when the day comes no one will care, I wouldnât want to disturb anyone with this. 

I feel bad that a first responder will have to discover my body and someone will have to clean up the mess. I think thatâs wrong and selfish of me, so I plan to go into the woods and dig a hole, get in it and shoot myself. I wish there was a way to have dirt fall on me after Iâm dead, maybe Iâll make a contraption, otherwise Iâll just let the animals eat me. Iâll disappear, and no one will care. 

Iâve been unhappy my whole life, ever since I was a little kid. Iâve always known I would kill myself one day, but Iâve tried to hide it and pretend I was ok. But Iâm not ok. I hate my self and I want to die. 

So, in probably about ten years Iâll be gone."
"As we know the vaccine is just about to come in a few weeks, How's my idea for a vaccination campaign

A big group will be organised to go to the vaccination center and everyone will get vaccinated in the group.

After everyone gets vaccinated, one person will start video recording and everyone in the group will simultaneously throw their masks in the air.

Just the way university students throw their hats in the air on graduation day, this could be epic.

What do y'all think?"
"Someone to die withSometimes I feel like all I need in the world is someone who feels like im at least worth dying with. I feel like all the people Ive met in my life don't give a damn about me, and its my own fault. All my insecurities make me doubt im worth anything at all and I feel like im not even a person worth caring about."

"Iâm tired of women My trust has been toyed with and I have a twisted perception of love. Added some girl and we were talking, it was pretty clear we liked each other. One day she doesnât talk to me at all, get a text that night âbyeâð¼â then she blocks me.

"I want to end it all after work tomorrow...I'm don't know, I was all good until yesterday when my boyfriend told me he got all giddy over a girl at work. I appreciated him telling me this, but it makes me feel bad and if I told him there would be no point; he's lost interest in me. It's the last straw really, since I've been feeling like we're not in love anymore...

It's been months since we've been happy really, there's no passion left and I don't have the energy to break up with him since I don't believe I could find anybody new. I went out on saturday night with my friend and all the men who did talk to me seemed unattractive to me personality-wise...

I've been working on an art project while working at a measly job I barley make enough money in, and all other jobs are way more than I can take (I tried retail, sales, food industry...).

I just do sometimes wish that life could have at least one little fairy-tale moment for me, but nothing seems to happen, even when I try so hard to make my boyfriend happy or work hard at my job...I just don't see any other way, and I feel like just ranting but having no energy anymore to get help..."
"Life is killing me.It's one of those nights where my bones feel heavy, where it feels like my ribcage is a ziptie around my chest. I'm cold, and even my fluffy blanket isn't keeping me warm. I have a test tomorrow. I'll do okay, but not great. I lost my place to live because of overcrowding at my university. I tried to tell my mom about what was going wrong, hoping for an ""It's okay"", and getting nothing but mild disinterest, the same for the few happy things that happened. Earlier today, I had mumbled to my boyfriend about how I missed my mom. I don't think she misses me. She didn't say I love you. I had a dream that I was laughing and joking with my younger self. She seemed a lot happier. She had such nice, long curly hair and a body without stretch marks and chronic pain. She told me it was okay to go to sleep for a long time. I cried. I woke up crying. Crying about how lovely it would be for all of this to be over. Crying about how I would be leaving behind such a wonderful boyfriend. I wish I could tell him, but I'm selfish. I don't want him to leave, but I want him to forget me so he won't ever be hurt If I die. He deserves so much more than me. I know I'll never get better, but some days, I wish I would. It's so hard to breathe. It's one of those nights."

"finally feel happyNow that I've made a foolproof plan to end my life I feel so liberated. It's like all my anxiety and self loathing is gone because the uncertain future I spent so much time dwelling on is gone. I don't care what anyone says it's not like I don't want to get better, but the hopeless attitude I have is out of my control. Hopefully I don't have my school sending out emails mourning my death acting like they cared. Hopefully attention whores don't post bible quotes saying that I'll be missed, because if they truly cared they would've missed me before I died. Fuck this shitty place and fuck mental illness I have found my solution and I really hope everyone else finds their own solutions as well, whether it be in the same manner as mine or not."

I must as well, I'll never get a girlfriend, I'm 19 and never kissed, had sex, smoked, clubbed and have no friends because they all moved countries and now pretty much spend my lonely nights at home by myself, yep fuck it, I'm going to die tomorrow. whats the point of living if im only going to suffer, shitty world, shitty society, shitty standards, shitty epxectations all for a fucking girl, fuck off, oh and shitty system. fuck everything."

"I think about killing myself every dayEvery day I think about killing myself.  I don't just think about it, I dream about it.  Everything would be so much easier if I could just delete myself.  It feels like an escape.  No matter how much I despise myself and everything I am, I can always retreat to that safe space in my mind where I will soon be reduced to nothing but a memory.  I've been up and down so many times and I'm just tired.  I'm starting to think that maybe this will be the .  I know that tomorrow is not the day, but maybe it will come soon.  I guess we'll just have to find out."
"I hate thisThe song sail says it perfectly; ""maybe I should cry for help, maybe I should kill myself"" 

I don't want to do it anymore. I struggle to get up, go to work, go to school, eat, sleep, repeat. I don't feel anything but guilt for being alive and for being jealous of people for things they can't help. I can't talk to my friends about my problems because they'll just get tired of how repetitive they are and how burdensome I am, so I lamely rant on the internet which is embarrassing and sad. I'm fucking pathetic really, and a waste of space. I genuinely deserve to die for being such a shitty excuse for a human being. "

"Delusions of insanityHello.

My Name is George.  Ok, it's really not.  But, I do live __ _ ______, figuratively speaking.  Well, not just any old figurative ______.  Its a Truman Show ______, as my ex-girlfriend thinks of it.  See, she is fairly good friends with a relative of ___ _______.  This concerned me.  See, I received an anonymous email.  Get it, anonymous?  Hur hur.  My quasi-joking manner is an effort to mask the pain of knowing the delusion of insanity.

See, I believe that people have this grand idea.  ""Let's make a post, perhaps on reddit.""  It will be for the lulz.  Hur hur.  Someone will get the message.  Especially if his name is George.  Yes, that is me.  Of course.

Yes, I do not want to live anymore.  This is why I am posting here.  I think people are facking liars.  I think you are probably a liar.  Maybe you are not.  But, what am I to believe?  I know she was a liar on some level (my ex, that is).  I know that she was under the spell of the relative of said person.  So, among other reasons, this was too much for me, and now its over.

I do not want to die because it is over with my ex.  I want to die because of the lulz.  Because of the diner.  I hate going to the diner.  What it means to me, to go to a diner, and see the lulz in action, to see the connection to my redd-ality.  

Are aliens real?  I see this little alien dude in the reddit log.  So let's talk.  How else could it be?  This is the only logical reason I can see.  Aliens must be real.  People do not have the time.  Or do they?

I cannot explain it.  But I can explain this.  I Want to die.  I will not do it.  I too scared to follow through.  Perhaps, thankfully.  Why?  Because I am still alive.

But, the insanity is too much.  The people do not give a shit.  You might, because you see someone in pain.  But, it is not so simple.  See, I want to die because, well, what I have seen is a mystery.  Knowing that I do not know, and that I will likely not ever know, is too much to bear.  Maybe I could accept Jesus, Allah, or someone.  I have no facking clue.  Maybe I should accept technology something else.  I don't know.  

But, I know that I am in pain.  I would ask for your help, but I do not need it.  I just need to try to understand for myself.  Why?  Is it just a mental illness?  Not likely.  I observe.  Theorize.  My observations are based on reality.

I would like to say thank you, and to those 'other ones', fack off.

I am sorry for the strange post.  Good day."

"My boyfriend just disappeared on me? So I was texting him and I asked ""hey, do you want to call soon?"" And said yeah he just had to do something then he'd call.

I waited for an hour and I got no call and no text. But he does this a lot, so I just kind of brushed it off and texted him again. Still no response. I thought, ""maybe he's just talking to his sister or his mom."" So I texted ""hey I'm gonna call in a couple minutes, okay?"" And still nothing.

After waiting an extra 8 minutes to call I finally do and it rang 2 times then goes to voicemail. Everytime I've called it rings 2 times and goes to voicemail. I thought maybe his phone died, but when it does it doesnt ring, it just goes straight to voicemail.

I dont know what's going on, he wont answer any of my calls or respond to my texts. Maybe I upset him or something. But yeah, I just wanted to rant. I've got a bad stabbing pain in my stomach so I'm just going to go to bed and see what happens in the morning"
"Life scares me. My long and boring story.Apologies in advance if there was somewhere better for this or anything.

Today was a tough day. For a long time I have felt very different from everyone else, everyone just seems to get it. The world scares me and I made too many mistakes in my life by giving into my fear. I feel like I am 5 years behind where I should be. I am almost 23 and I haven't had a real job because when I was in school and I should've been bagging groceries or working at mcdonalds I was petrified of people so I didn't try. Now when I do try I have nothing to back me up.

Growing up I was a very gifted kid, I thought it might be my thing. I was kinda fat, wasn't good with people, I felt like being good at school was all I had. As the years went on everyone else caught up, I wasn't trying as hard, I got scared and I gave up. By the time I finished high school I was being plagued by the question ""what do you what to be"". I didn't know. I still don't know. I could never imagine a future with me in it. I envied those who dreamed of being doctors or pilots or garbage men. Anything! I was just lost.

At the time I thought ""follow your heart"" philosophy and thought that since I kind of enjoyed languages, I should pursue them somehow. In retrospect I should have gone for something more safe like accounting. At the time I thought I'd rather struggle than do something I hated.

After 3 years doing a useless degree with very mediocre marks I graduated with nothing. After highschool I knew that the next step was university, after university it was all back on me, and I had no idea. That was 2 years ago and I still haven't moved on. 

I would have periods of enthusiams where I would apply for anything and everything. Most of the time I would not hear back at all, occasionally I would get an interview, out awkward myself and never hear back. So the periods of dejection and giving up would happen for a few weeks, and the cycle continued.

In that time my parents got divorced and living with my mother has become a real burden. I am making life really difficult for her because she has to rent a house she can't afford. Occasionally I get one day type jobs that keep things going but theres no stability.

I've watched my friends become too busy for me. They have their own lives and I am wasting away. I saw the ""loser"" of my group of friends at the supermarket and he has become successful. I know its terrible admitting it but I used to feel better than him, now I am the new him.

So this brings us to today. My mum and dad ambush me and say how hard I make it for them. How much they worry about me. They stay awake at night worried I will end up on the streets. My dad pretty much asked me if I was on drugs (I'm not) or molested as a kid (I wasn't). That's how bad I seem to them.

I've never gotten to the point of seriously contemplating suicide. Early on I would fantasize about how everyone would react when I was gone. Then it would become thinking about how I do it, but never actually considering it. Lately I've been noticing a trend. When I cross the street, part of me hopes a car will come speeding down the road and knock me down. I have the sudden urge to jerk the steering wheel into a wall when I'm driving. It's getting more and more pervasive into my mind and that concerns me afterwards.

So that's me. Lonely, unmotivated, no future, unskilled, (practically) uneducated with things getting harder every week.

I'm scared. Everything scares me and I just feel like I haven't got what it takes to live in this world, and I'm scared for the future.

I'm sorry for the word vomit. Its too hard to talk to anyone I know, I feel like noone understands, everyone has their own problems that make me feel guilty. Writing a block here got my head a bit clearer and my stomach less knotty for now until it comes back."
"I need help So there was this girl that I really liked. Like a lot. We dated for a few days until just recently. See Iâm a sophomore in high school, and this girl is in 8th grade, but the thing is, Iâm just now finding out about this. She had lied to me and said that she was a freshman because she knew that I wouldâve never dated an 8th grader. Now, I really like this girl and sheâs only one year younger than me, but at the same time I donât want to be known as the weirdo who dates middle schoolers. AND she lied to me. Idk what to do and I already broke up with her for it... but I didnât really want to. I just wouldnât feel comfortable dating an 8th grader. I want to know what the best decision would be for this."
Sticky sticky ricky He got stuck inside the chimney
"Attempting Suicide made me no longer suicidal but for all the wrong reasonsLast week I was in the hospital cause I attempted suicide (for the second time), but Iâm no longer suicidal. Not because I feel really any better, but because Iâve realized I physically cannot kill myself. Its like my brain says yes, but my body says no. 

I tried to stab myself and you would expect that I probably at least left a pretty good gash, but no the knife barley even penetrated my body. Youâd think I had used a butter knife but I didnât. I wasnât even dripping blood. I just sat there dumbfounded for an hour that I cant even kill myself right. 

So ya I guess in a way I should be happy Im still alive, but my life still is shit and arguably shittier now since I pretty much just got guilt tripped by my family for the whole damn thing. And now everyones off doing their own thing like nothing happened and im still the same old depressed fuck.

I have no friends, no job, Iâve only completed a couple classes of college and im 22 now (23 in september). No money either. Never been in a relationship nor do I feel close to anyone. 

I want to work and go to school but Ive struggled to keep at it for any longer than a couple months (doesnât help I have ADD either). 

I just donât know what to do. Iâve been depressed ever since I was 4 or 5. Yet, I feel like Iâve done everything I could possibly do, but still get shit on by life and people. Never drank, smoked, did any drugs, or committed any crime. Hell I never even hit anyone, despite the fact Ive been hit by people. Graduated high school with a damn near perfect GPA. Tried dozens of different medications, been to multiple therapists/therapy programs and currently still go to one. And no matter what I canât seem to get any better. 

Only thing I got going right now is my physical health is fine. But what good is being healthy, if Im always alone, sad, and angry. Ya nobody said life was fair, but jesus christ would it kill to have just one thing go my way? just once!?"
"Becoming increasingly frustrated, lonely and vengeful towards others and my life everydaySorry for the long rant.
With each day that passes, iâm becoming more and more frustrated, full of rage, lonely, upset and vengeful. The thoughts that crowd my head 24/7 are literally fucking breaking me down. Iâve got bald patches in my hair, COMPLETEY torn apart my palms with needles. 

Each day that goes by Iâm alone, with literally no friends or ANYONE to talk to at all. Iâm stuck inside my bedroom with my own thoughts. Iâve been doing a LOT of drugs of all kinds lately and tearing apart my skin and hair because iâve got nothing else to do except sit in my room. Iâm a fucking miserable waste of space. Iâm truant and got expelled from this school year so I have to repeat it. My parents keep pushing me to get a job and grow up. I canât take it anymore. I genuinely cannot. Iâm breaking down every fucking second and i JUST WANT TO FUCKING DIE. I think about killing others and myself everyday but I will never go to the hospital again. Iâm just going to do it. I donât give a fuck anymore about all these failed friendships and relationships and every fucking body abandoning me. Good fucking riddance. I donât give a shit how I die or if itâs the most painful way to die. I just need it over with. Iâve nothing to live for anymore."
"Nothing seems to be going my wayHello, I am 17 and it may seem a bit young to start complaining about all of the shit that happened to me, but it made me depressed as fuck and I donât think I can make it out of this swing. About 3-4 months ago, I started to date a girl that to most people wasnât attractive but she was beautiful to me and I thought that she was the one. She was a grade below me(I graduated this year so I guess that is something good). I thought it was going well and she just stopped talking to me and a couple weeks later she came to me and said she wanted to focus on academia and I should be doing that too. Not a few weeks after that I got into a car accident(I am ok, it was just a rear end) and I broke one of the companyâs trucks a couple days after that. It just feels that everything I try to do to become a successful and happy person just fails and breaks. Nothing makes me happy and there is no one to talk to that will help me with this (all of my close friends know about my depression and they help out with getting me out of it by giving me some social interaction). I donât enjoy the job I work but I feel that I would disappoint my parents by quitting. My parents always told me that they were proud of me and I donât think that I made them proud from all of my actions. I donât want to sound edgy but I almost ended it all last night. I have had suicidal thoughts before but I was never as close as I was last night to ending it all, I just feel like a waste of space and time for people who care about me."
"What are yalls thoughts on in-person vs online schooling?

"I failed everyone... including methis is just a little something that has bothered me more and more as time goes on. As a kid, I was always seen as the poster child for basketball in my family. Everyone knew I was good and I would practice almost everyday with dreams of just dominating day in and day out. I even ended up being a team captain my senior year when I went to a school with over 650 kids and a good reputation in ball. All that changed my first week of the season.

I ended up doing terrible as even though I would do good in practice, Coach would never put me in for games in order to make time for his favorites. I would openly challenged them and outplay them but I never got the spot my sophomore or junior year . Now my first senior game and Iâm sucking? Geez how fun. I ended up getting benched for one of the younger guys and later that week I sustained horrible nerve damage in my left arm that would leave me basically handicapped for 6 months. It still bothers me now and then, but to know that I let all of my peers and loved ones down was a complete bummer. 

I lost all my confidence in turn and now I donât even know what to do. I donât know who I am. I feel like I never got a chance to prove my worth, and now everyday itâs in the back of my mind of âwhat if.â I totally let down my parents even though they never showed up to any of my games. I was always just trying to be the best I could be and I thought it would be good enough; in turn I ended up with nothing and now Iâm rejected by almost everyone I know because of what a fuck up I am. All the kids blame me it feels like and they just distanced themselves. I feel like a reject. 

Every week having to go to sports medicine to try and recover what was left of my season and not even getting the green light to at-least sit the bench without warmups never happened. I never was respected or loved the same and I felt alone. 

People will poke fun at me too because I couldnât even move my arm in the beginning for the first month and when it was out of my arm sleeve it would just fucking flip around like a noodle. But the numbing was traumatizing and the nerves would tingle with pain. I fucking hated every second of it. I let down everyone and Iâm not worth shit. Iâm a failure. I fucking failed even though I put years and years of dedication and no matter what anyone told me I kept going for nothing. It was all for nothing. Iâm a nobody now at my highschool and I donât even want to talk to anyone because I donât feel like there is anyone that I CAN talk to about this. I feel like it would only make things worse. I wasted my fucking life and my time on some fucking game. I just want some help and advice... :("

There's Fireworks Going Off Right Now. I Think a Gunshot Will Blend in.Why haven't I killed myself already? I've wanted to for the last 6 years. 
"Would people envy a 30yo outcast shy loner with $250K net worth or pity him?I'm 32 with a $250K net worth which according to online calculators would place me around the 95th percentile for NW in my age range. While that may be impressive for a man if everything else in his was normal, that's not the case for me

Other than that high NW and the fact that I've traveled to nearly 10 countries, I don't have much going for myself. I've been bullied and ostracized many times in school and in the workplace. I have many gaps in my resume due to being fired or quitting early jobs due to being bullied. 

Also, while that NW and my $100K job may seem like a lot, for people who also work as software engineers at my age, alot of them are making at least double that since they likely don't have any gaps in their resume and weren't bullied out of jobs

Also, I still struggle with shyness, depression, social anxiety, and literally have no friends. I just have acquaintances I've met from meetup groups. I've never even had a girlfriend. More girls have shown my pity than they've shown romantic interest

I believe I have pretty severe PTSD from all the past bullying. I've seen numerous therapists and none of them have really helped.

Alot of times I struggle with even having motivation to live. I've literally met only a few people who have been as shy, friendless, softspoken or depressed as me

I'd like honest feedback as to whether people would actually be envious of me or whether they would pity me and look down on me, similar to how society pities/looks down on the homeless, men who have minimum paying jobs, etc"
"The reason I want to mostI mean, being totally honest, the biggest reason I want to end it is to give everyone who hurt me a big middle finger. Make them feel guilty for everything everyone has done to me.

But even if they don't, even if they never found out, it would still remove someone like me from the gene pool, so like at least that isn't the only reason. 

I can't fit in anywhere, I get rejected, hated, fired, banned, removed, barred, etc. from every community I've ever been in. I'm so fucked up, I typed out that first sentence up there with honesty. 

Third time's the charm. Everyone is asleep, I'm turning my phone off, keeping a shotgun in my arms pointed at the door in case someone who knows me see's this and calls the cops. I'm going to drift away, and not wake up, and it'll make the world a better place. The middle finger will just be some icing on the cake. 

But honestly, it's not their fault for not accepting me. Obviously if everyone treats me the same, the problem lies with me, and no matter what I do to try and fix it, I always fail and don't deserve to ever be forgiven. My twisted view of reality makes me think that people should be honest with me, tell me what I do that upsets them, maybe help to better myself or at least give me advice, instead of internalizing it all. 

But I'm not worth it, no one is. Expecting people to understand me or help me is the wrong way of thinking. I don't fit in, I never will anywhere. I've tried emulating how people act, but that just pisses them off more. I've spent all my freetime researching human behavior and psychology, but it hasn't helped me gain any more self control or to appease people enough to not try to remove me. 

So honestly, giving them a middle finger as I go is childish, but I'm angry, so let me have it. All together they've driven me to this point, and when I go one of two things will happen; they'll change their ways to understand and accept more people, or they'll send me off with a middle finger right back. Both are outcomes I'm ok with. Even in the latter, it proves I was meant and wanted to go, maybe I can at least do one thing right. 

I low-key want to name off all of the communities that have rejected me, but the fear of coming off as attention whoring would send the wrong message, especially if I survive. I wouldn't want people to go off and tell them what I was doing, I'd rather they find out for themselves, and it might even be better if they never find out. Peace out everyone, this rant turned into a note, but whatevs. 

Given I've walked away from putting two guns in my mouth and pulling the trigger, I won't rule out the possibility that I might survive this, so I'm not going to hit send especially out of fear of someone finding this and stopping me. So to whoever finds my body, hit the submit button for me. It's at the bottom of the page.

Actually I don't want to risk them not sending it. My voice needs to be spoken, even if it's somewhere few people will hear, but maybe at least the right people will hear it. I'm going to bank on not surviving, the fact I literally can't afford another hospital visit because all my cards are over balance should give me the determination I need to make sure the job gets finished. The last visit totally fucked up my budget, and put me out of work for too long, so I'm going to say my last attempt was a success, it just took a few weeks to kick in. Just remember though, phone off, gun at door. If anyone walks in they're getting buckshot, at least until I die. 

Note, I didn't delete anything while typing. I typed everything on my mind, which is why you see a lot of contradictions, neverminds, and general banter. Fuck this was a lot of text, I probably look really stupid and crazy. Eh, who cares. That's why I'm going anyways, afterall."
"i have therapy tomorrow and i don't think i'll be honest with my therapistlast time i talked to him he literally told everything to my parents; the pills i collected, my plans, the bridge i liked sitting on, everything. i didn't even say anything suicidal, all i did was being honest with him. can't tell my parents that i don't want to go because then they will say that they payed so much for it and that i always waste their money but the therapist's place of work is 3 hours away from where i live and being stuck in the car with my parents for 3 hours sucks. plus on our way back home i'll be reminded that i'm selfish for being suicidal and that i hurt everyone. i want to end it today."
"Self harm dreamsWell, I guess my levels of stress and all have progressed to the point where my dreams are my loved ones cheering me on as I cut and self harm. So thereâs that.

&amp; no I havenât self harmed yet, a few weeks ago I was even more volatile but I donât view self harm as a way out... because well, youâre still here afterwards. 

Anyone else dream like this? I was literally just driving knives deep into my arm to the elation of my loved ones. Tough thing to wake up to"

"If they are (most likely) talking to other people and the friendship between me and them was messy

why do they still keep finding reasons to text me?"
"Iâm really feeling at the end of my ropesFrankly only am posting here cause I need to tell someone. None of my friends care, no one texts me back within 24 hours, if I ever say anything about my depression it gets ignored or brushed aside, yet Iâm fucking ALWAYS there for them when they have fucking girl issues or something, itâs infuriating. Maybe I sound selfish but I just feel so brushed aside at this point and feel beyond worthless. Like really, does anyone care about me? Anytime I have a big appointment Iâm nervous for, no encouragement or anything. I. Am. Nobody."
"I'm freak During the lesson, we were informed that the schools will be closed from tomorrow (bc of COVID). As I won't see my crush again for the next few months, I started to look at her (short glances) and did it \~40 times in an hour.

She probably notice that and now I'm feel like a fuckin creep"

"Going through a divorce, bankruptcy, and looking at losing my homeI bought a water hose and duct tape this morning. I'm currently sitting at the location where I will take my last breath. I connected the hose to my exhaust and ran it in to my vehicle. I turned the vehicle on and stayed there for a couple of minutes. I couldn't finish it. I turned my vehicle off. I'm building up the courage to finish. I think I've almost got the courage again. If I'm not mistaken, it only talked about 15 minutes and is painless. I wish I had another choice. I don't know if I'll respond or not. "
"I have an inferiority complexI have a severe inferiority complex. I've had it for almost 3 years now, and it's cost me pretty much everything. It started with me losing my best friend because I was a belligerent asshole, then changing my behavior completely and trying to become someone I'm not (specifically, someone with empathy and humility), and then meeting new people that made me revert to my old personality. I've never been a good person, and I'm not just saying that, if you saw the things I did behind closed doors you'd beat the shit out of me. I've blackmailed people to get them to keep talking to me, stole people's social media passwords to see what they were saying about me and conspired with other groups of people to get back at those who ""betrayed"" me, even if their betrayal was completely justified. I am the most pathetic, genuinely disgusting person I've ever met, and because of recent events I was just reminded of that. My friend group has cut me off, and like last time it stings really bad. They stopped talking to me because I was jealous of my best friend spending time with someone that disliked me, someone whose presence I hated so much I tried to stir up shit to make them hate each other. Once my grand scheme was found out they stopped talking to me. That was it. I'm blocked on social media, I can't send texts, and if I approached them in real life they'd probably call the cops. So here we go, once again, I'm all alone and have to meet new people so the cycle can repeat. 

I think the term ""antisocial extrovert"" fits me perfectly. Not because I avoid socialization, but because I end up completely ignoring the norms, which results in a majority of people not being able to stand me. I always end up making friends that share my traits, and our friendship is toxic as a result. It always ends the same way, too; they do something that pisses me off, I do something in response, they cut me off and I go full stalker mode and try to fuck them over in whatever way possible. It's going to happen now, it's going to happen in the future, it probably won't stop until someone kills me or I kill myself. I am dependent on other people but I can't respect their feelings, and if I try to change that I'll just get bored and go back. 

Fuck my life."

"I don't know how to liveI feel like I can't live a life. Like I wasn't supposed to live a life. I'm sorry this won't make sense, I'm so tired. I just keep thinking about doing something and I need to distract myself. I'm such a piece of shit. I just avoiding things and put things of and sabotage the opportunities I'm given. And I know I'm young and that these things now probably seem like nothing to most people, but I know in my heart that even though they're a small they just give a true look into who I am and the shitty fucking useless person I am truly. I'm so tired, but I don't want to sleep because when I go to sleep I wake up and it's tomorrow. I'm so tired. I don't know how I'm supposed to live a full life where I get an education and a job and a husband and kids I don't know how that's supposed to happen for someone like me. Someone who can't even fucking get up and do laundry or falls asleep on the cold bathroom tile every morning. I don't know how to be a full fledged fucking person in this world that doesn't seem to have space for me. I am surrounded by people, but I feel so alone. Like they're all in love with this version of me, this perception of me they have when really they don't the half of it. I have nowhere to go. My life is not a path I walk it is scaling down a mountain side, the only clear path the rope that dangles me from the place I started. I'm so sorry this doesn't make any sense. I'm so tired."

"Is there a way I can tell my therapist that I'm suicidal WITHOUT getting sent to a hospital/mental asylum?I have been seeing a therapist for a week now, and I want to tell her I've been experiencing suicidal thoughts recently (I've been close to actually doing it numerous times; I sat on the edge of a 7-story building last week), but I also don't *want* to be hospitalized. Especially because I'm in the US.

Is there any possible way I can spill the beans to my therapist about these intrusive thoughts without facing a mountain of bills?"

"I regret waking up in the morning every single damn day. I don't think I'm ready, willing, or able to live anymore.Life is and always will be horrible. Its unjustly imposed upon you just so you can suffer. It's like I'm in hell already.

I wish I was never born. I was never going to amount to anything anyway. It would've been easier if I never existed because then I wouldn't have to deal with finding an easy way to kill myself. 

I probably have potential for at least decent things but I will be honest with myself. I will never tap into that potential as long as I live. I'm too weak minded to change. The thought of living another 60 year sickens me. I'd rather die right now. I wish someone would just come murder me or something. It would be less of a shock to the people closer to me. They wouldn't have to deal with the shock of finding my dead body right after I kill myself.

Getting hit by lightning would be a cool way to die too. Too bad that won't happen. I'll probably die in some pathetic way like hanging myself or jumping off a bridge."
"I almost got Baker ActedI woke up yesterday to my eye irritated, and filled with fluid. It hurt like hell, and I decided I had to go to the ER to get help. I got checked in, and the nurse took me back to get my blood pressure, etc. She asked a few general questions, as per usual. 

Then she asked if I had thoughts of hurting myself. I thought about answering no, because I'm used to dealing with this issue on my own. But I felt compelled to tell the truth, so I said yes. 

Suddenly it was high alert. She began talking to me in a calmer, more soothing voice. She wrote this down on my papers, and she asked me more questions, like if I had a plan, etc. 

All questions were answered truthfully. I told her I didn't have a plan, that it was more of just a thought. She accepted this, and soon I was taken to my room. After getting situated, another nurse came in, and was acting the same way. Calm, soothing tones, asking me questions, confirming what I'd told the other nurse. 

She comforted me, and said a specialist was on her way. The specialist got there, and again, more questioning. She said I was going to be monitored, and that there was a possibility I was going to be Baker Acted. 

This scared me for a few reasons. I've never been baker acted before, and I didn't know what to expect, and I didn't think I was a danger to myself at the moment. I understood, though, that this was just them making sure I was safe. 

After getting blood and urine tests done, another woman came and asked me about my thoughts. Same round of questioning, again. I told her everything, and soon she left. 

I should clarify, that though I have suicidal thoughts, I'm deathly afraid of death. (Pun intended)

It's more of a feeling of not wanting to exist. Not wanting to feel. Just to be numb, and not hurt anymore. I can't, and I won't, take my life. But it doesn't stop me from thinking about it. 

After a long time, the specialist came back and told me my thyroid is ""out of wack"" as she put it. She said this is what could be causing weight gain, as well and mood swings, depression, and my thoughts. She gave me a list of clinics for me to try, and discharged me from the hospital with parting words of encouragement and hope. 

I thought for a while there I was going to regret telling them the truth, but I'm glad I did. I have an appointment tomorrow with a therapist, and hopefully get some medication to balance out my emotions. Wish me luck, guys."

"TikTok is disgusting. In the past 6 months of me using TikTok Iâve seen someone whom killed themselves because people blamed them with their past mistakes then celebrated after the death of that specific person, wishing for death of someone because they did a bad acting of an anime character, witchcraft/hexes with bad intentions posted âaestheticallyâ, and a person getting doxxed because they wonât post their secret coffee recipe and then getting called it cultural appropriation because they canât post the recipe even though the people of that specific culture says it isnât, over-sexualisation of children, and more horrible things.

TikTok is a great platform to create content, however it is full of toxicity and pretentious shit."

"No desire seems worth itToday I have only been confronted with the BS in this world. The struggles of trying to sustain yourself, the cruelties of the political system. And then you just wonder do I want to go through that. I'm still in high school, I am far from being able to claim I've really struggled, really been at the bottom. Yet, even at this stage I cannot grasp why I want to go through with it all. That combined with the occasional demon of self-hate peeking its head now and again, which recently really go to me and had me believe I would end it that day. Usually I would just vent or ask for help on discord, but I can't speak of this to my friends there they too are fighting. Being all down might pull them with me. Doing it anywhere else on discord I know I""ll get the messages I've read before: ""contact a hotline"" I can't do that. There is so little I can do, not because I am physically incapable to. But just because of me, this weak spirit. It's so weak I can't do simple tasks without forsaking everything. I am useless. And they only way for that to change is to not be stuck like this. But do I want to be able to do things? Is wanting anything even worth it? I just know I'm disregarding a lot of things but everything feels so closed down on me. Naturally I am the problem."
"I finally accepted the fact.When people say that others can't understand them, it always comes of as clichÃ© and insincere. That is why I've tried time and time again to formulate my state of mind to others in hopes that they would understand, alas, I can't. For a over a year straight I've conversed with people and I've tried to convey my thoughts and feelings but I've failed to do so every time. 

I don't have friends, I never did. Maybe my personality is to blame, maybe I'm just a terrible person. It's all very confusing, but the fact I could never find anyone I guess serves as a testament to my unintelligible self. 

I'm not bright enough to understand myself nor am I capable of describing how I think and feel. For many years I couldn't come to terms with this fact, but I finally managed to do so at last. It's become clear that I was destined to be alone, I can no longer build myself up only to fall back down. 

Don't bother reaching out to me as I know how all of those conversations go, neither should you try to befriend me since you'll inevitably leave once you tire of me. I simply felt like Ã had to get it out even though it didn't serve to accomplish anything.

"Give Me a Reason.What are some universal reasons that I shouldn't kill myself. I can't come up with anything. 

Background: got my driver's license like 3 days ago and I still feel like shit, like it doesn't matter at all. I should be proud of myself or positive I'm taking a step forward but I'm not. 
I have no friends and my ex hates me. I still love him and I know I won't ever love anyone else. I don't have any motivation to go to work other than when I kill myself there will be a lot of money my ex can use to fix his situation. 
I have no family, they've all abandoned me and hate me as well. Also my boss fired me today. I have a week left and then I'm done. 
I also don't have anywhere to live. Currently sleep under the structure at a park or under the stationary truck parked near my work. I shower at the local YMCA and hangout at Subway to collect extra food. I can't get a loan for a car because I have no job. I have no one to rely on. I want a car because then I have reliable transportation and a place to sleep. It's also cheaper than renting anything. 

To top it all off, was recently diagnosed with a personality disorder. I have suicidal thoughts every day. Most of the time actually. And have been told they will never go away. 

I legit can't look at a door without picturing myself slamming the door shut on my face over and over.  When I'm in a car I see myself rolling out the door while driving to see what it'll do. Or a heading collision that'll kill me cause I don't wear seatbelts. 
Sometimes when I have a cigarette I put it out on my arm because that's what I think of. And want to see what burns are like. 

Tried suicide hotlines but they've all hung up on me or just ended the conversation ""because I'm aggressive"" I don't feel like me yelling and swearing at my situation is aggressive towards them in any way. If I talk to anyone (friends) well more like people I know the name of. I'm not close to anyone. Talking to them about this stuff makes everyone uncomfortable. So it's just me and my stupid brain. 

Like I said in the title give me a reason, cause I got none."

"I think this is it16, guy, my mom just caught me smoking weed for the second time. I opened up to her a little bit about the depression and suicidal thoughts. I think she understands. I know if i keep on things are going to get a whole lot worse, i was already contemplating it before, i think im gonna go do it in a little bit"
This world is driving me insane and desperateI want to kill this narc man who ruined my life. I want to kill my classmates who isolated myself. I want to kill myself... I am so done with this stupid world...
What happens if I fail?Besides end up in the ward. What consequences do I face if I am not successful with my plan? What happens to my credit card debt and others after missed payments.
"Permanent solution for PERMANENT problem.Yes. At least in my case problems won't end. Life is a problem. The only thing I like is the Internet, nothing else. I don't like the real life, it's like hell."
"Can't even sleep anymore.I'm getting truly desperate in life. I'm a 20 year old male. My parents went through a rough divorce when I was around 12. My dad's been an alcoholic my whole life. I never thought these things affected me but now I'm not so sure. I had a good life in school, had lots of friends and played sports. I met a girl when I turned 16. She made me happy and I spent everyday with her. This was the happiest I have ever been but obviously it didn't last. I had my first taste of heartbreak and I turned heavily to drugs. I live on an island so starting using darknet markets to get drugs from a very young age. This gave me access to anything I wanted. I started taking loads of Ecstasy pills after my break up (bearing in mind I wasn't testing shit so fuck knows what I was taking) and using cannabis to sleep. I seen the way people who sold pills got treated by everyone. People got excited when they were around. I wanted that. So regretfully against my Morales I starting selling and ordering them for people. A boy then died of a Cardiac arrest after taking to many pills. I truthfully don't know if it was pills I brought up or if it was someone else's as there was so many about back then. People on the island blamed me for it though and things starting happening. That's something I'll carry with me for the rest of my life and rightfully so. I pray that it wasn't the pills I was bringing up that he OD' on but either way I knew what I was doing was Morally wrong but I still did it. I lost all the friends I had in school because they didn't want anything to do with the way I was behaving so I can't blame them for that. I never touched an Ecstasy tablet again. 

Fast forward a year or two of not being up to much except trying to keep myself sedated with whatever I had handy my mum started to become sick of me. I was kicked out and couldn't live with my dad and his wife because if anyone had tried to live with 2 alcoholics then I'm sure you can understand. I ended up living in a homeless shelter for a year and this very nearly destroyed me. I was taking Xanax and Valium and ended up with a pretty bad addiction. I decided to stop this cold turkey one day and since then nothing has brought me even momentary happiness. Few months later I started drinking GHB daily. My mum then let me move back in and one day she found me in a severe GHB coma and paramedics were called. I then stopped using GHB and have been trying and failing to remain sober. My vices now are weed and alcohol. If I could sleep well then I'd put them both down but I seem to have bad insomnia.

People always say ask for help but I genuinely am but no one is coming to help. My mum and dad don't get it and seem to busy in there own lives for me. I've expressed to them how suicidal I am probably in the hopes that they would do something but they don't. The mental health services on my island are virtually non existent so even going to doctors is pointless which I've tried. I guess you have to attempt suicide before anyone believes you. I've applied for online CBT so I'll see how that goes. On the other hand I'm waiting on opiates coming so I'll probably end up with another addiction or maybe be brave enough to eat the whole lot and hopefully not wake up. Might sound odd to people that I'm going out of my way to buy something I know I'll probably get addicted to but in all honesty I prefer to be an addict than feel the way I currently do.

I've missed out a lot of details and apologies for any grammatical errors, it's the morning and I haven't slept. Was getting bored of tossing and turning in bed so just wanted to share my story. Any advice would be much appreciated."

"I want to talk to someoneI want to talk to someone about my plans. I am not a secretive person and itâs making me anxious not being able to tell people what Iâm planning and feeling. I want it to be private, not shared and I want someone to not bullshit me about it getting better.  I just need to get it out of my head and ease my anxiety of being secretive.

"Went on my phone after 90~ minutes of revision/study, but of course my mom had to walk in. I was doing some homework and revision since noon, and I decided to have a break, for 15 minutes, but my mom has to walk in and think I have been on there for the whole day, saying ""you don't do any work"" although I have done 80% of my homework.

"Fuck it I'm throwing in the towel.Sick of this shit. Life sucks. I'm prolly too much of a pussy to actually do it though. I just wanna be gone.

My sister is loving her own life and I never see anymore. I feel so alone. I just want relief. I know I won't actually kill myself but damn I really want to. I had dreams but now i'm just fucked in the head. When I'm not drunk or high I miserable and feel like shit. I already feel like I died.

I have given up. No matter how hard Ive tried recently I just can't keep going. And at this point I don't even want to anymore.  


My mom and my brother don't stop lecturing me about how much I ruined my life, and how everything is my fault. I know I've messed up. STOP REMINDING ME. Even after I told my mom about my suicidal thoughts.  


My mom is a firm believer of god, she would always tell me its god's will and he has a plan, and the plan is apparently for me to be so miserable. She would always just say god is with you. I told her god doesn't care about me. I have never been religious. And she got mad and told me I should actually just kill myself for not believing in god.  


Thank you."
"I've suddenly realised I have no other option, I'm getting my affairs in order now. The end should come later today.I have failed. A piece of coursework for my university is due in Wednesday and there is so much to do and so little time in which to do it I will absolutely fail it. 

I haven't been attending much as of recently, my heads imploded, I'm isolated here and I've become a disgusting degenerate. Drinking and drinking and smoking and staying in bed because I'm too terrified to face the reality that is the outside world. 

I nearly killed myself in January because I was on the brink of failing, however, I managed to get the exams delayed due to genuine reasons. Car crash and eviction. This time, what excuse do I have? It's my own fault. I have to pass everything to pass. So I've failed this. I will have to set my plan in action.

My whole meaning in life is my future career, my dream. If I fail this I will be resigned to my shitty hometown working in a dead end job miserable, a burden to my family and probably end up killing myself anyway. At least this way it'll be done far away from everyone. 

This and my messy head that never stops being messy and my body and my mind and everything. No. No more. It ends here. I'm 20 years old and I've been insane on and off since 14, it's just getting worse as I get older, the pills don't seem to be helping. But they'll help me today. I plan to gather all medication I have in my room, painkillers and my sleeping pills, add that in with a large amount of vodka and put a plastic bag over my head just as I start passing out. 

This is it. 

I'm sorry. I'm sorry I failed you all."
"My mother did it 6 years ago, why can't I?I'm drunk, emotional, and just want Brianna to love me the way I do her.

"Only reason I'm alive is because of my kidsI feel sad less and empty more as time goes on. I don't want to exist anymore. I don't even want to talk to people I know about it because it's just the same bullshit. If I were to kill myself tonight the people that barely cared to even go out of their way to text me back would cry like I was their best friend. The few people I am close to would say ""I had no idea she was this bad"" when I've been nothing but obvious about everything. My 2 year old son and the fact that I'm currently pregnant are the only things that are keeping me here and I almost feel frustrated because of it. I didn't have anywhere else to turn or anyone else to talk to so I figured in case something happened I had this."

Whatâs even the point of going on anymore?

To live the next 70 years in complete agony? To die old and horribly depressed with memories full of abuse and self hate??

But whatâs the bet I wonât even do it, Iâll get so close to the edge and Iâll pussy out like I always do. Useless piece of shit canât even kill himself properly. I donât deserve to live Iâm just a fucking coward.

"I'm bored down to chat about whatever Im down to chat about whatever. I can talk about dinosaurs, some videogames, if your in horny jail you can come talk to me, idc. 15m straight if it matters."
"A difficult case!Iâm not very good at articulating or really feeling emotions. Iâm pretty sure Iâm not sad though. I donât cry any more than normal for a guy, and I laugh and I smile and I appreciate the little things in life. Iâm an optimist, and I take time out of my day to appreciate the work people around the world have put into the things I enjoy, like my old car or my old computer or my old clothes. Itâs really a wonder how people today enjoy such awesome things, and yet they donât really give a goddamn about âem.

I live in an absolutely beautiful place that Iâm absolutely grateful to be in, but nobody around me seems to care about it. I really feel fundamentally different from the society around me.

I dropped out of college after I got demotivated by both an advisor fuck-up and a complete lack of financial aid despite straight Aâs. I have no desire to make any more money than I currently do. I truly appreciate everything that I currently have, and recognize that not doing so simply leads to desiring better and more fanciful things that really arenât all that necessary.

Yet, it seems like modern society is all about buying new cars as status symbols, buying large televisions as status symbols, buying fancy houses as status symbolsâ¦ et cetera. I donât get it, I really donât.

Iâve travelled across the US and I have seen everything Iâve wanted to see, and done everything Iâve wanted to do. Iâve experienced true love, Iâve learned a lot about the world around me, and Iâve tasted exceptional food.

The main reason I just donât feel like going on any longer is because I donât really have anything to look forward to. I donât want to do anything else in life, and anything beyond this point would be a form of stasis â just waiting off the inevitable while I keep my body running.

The thought of jumping off a nearby cliff makes me feel happiness and completeness, and I spend most of my days looking forward to the unconsciousness of sleep.

I have to stress that I do not cry or feel sadness when thinking about suicide. I simply feel that I have completed my run in life, I completed my lifeâs dream before 21, and now have no motivations to carry me forward. Anything from here on, I feel like Iâd just be a drain on natural resources and taking away from the younger generation which has just as much a right to life as I do.

So what on Earth should keep me from jumping?

"No Free will 

We have no free will. They have inserted diseases so we go for a treatment so they can keep a log of us and we keep going back for more and more eventually profiting from our suffering. There is a lot of money to be made from keeping people sick and selling people the illusion that these so called medication do but they do more harm than good. We are slaves to the elites who will soon replace us with robots. They sold everyone a fantasy that everyone was special when everyone is not special and that we are all slaves.

They strip of our individuality and they stay in power rather than being human about it. We are all in one sick science experiment where eugenics is still in motion. Everything costs money these days. I mean everything. You have no freedom. The only freedom you have is the internet and even then that's an illusion.

I get the feeling that we are all being tested in a science experiment to see how much we can take it until we snap and they send us to prison and take a photo of us in the archives to keep and then run a story of how deeply flawed this person is who make even more money. Big brother already keeps a record of everything we do hence why the internet was invented.

Might as well commit suicide. Fuck these pieces of shit who stole away our freedom. This world makes auschwitz looks like child's play and that our life is simply just protoplasm used to leech life out of us and it's no wonder we don't live in a decentralized economy but they use money as a form of control to psychologically torture you in this bullshit capitalist society which keeps you a prisoner. They are just waiting for you to make a mistake so they can take away your liberty anytime they want.

Friendly fascism won a long time ago. They all have a comfortable life and live in fancy apartment buildings feeding their own fantasy at the expense of ours. They can simply print money out of thin air and buy up land and call it a day and tell people to do their dirty work for them. They all want to live in the fantasy world because they were probably abused when they were little so they are having fun with us.

They use mathematics which is another fantasy and use that in the real world and no wonder we have so many problems in the world. It's because they are trying to apply absolutes to a world that has no absolutes."

"I think I have literally 0 best friends including the internet now. We haven't talked in weeks and we keep saying we're going to talk and we never doI haven't had an IRL best friend for about a year and a half now. Ruined that one by saying she was my ""favorite person"" more than once while she had a boyfriend. I realize now that's probably even heavier than telling someone you love them. Even though I would've been fine with having them as a friend I really felt I wanted to let her know just how much I appreciated her. Like this chick was the first person to prove to me again and again that she legitimately liked being around me and liked having me as a friend. Even though she had plenty of other friends she legit liked hanging out with me and no one has even done that before. There are people I THOUGHT had done this but then later turns out that wasn't true but of course I still tried to be their friend and follow them around all the time and probably be annoying. Of course there are people at work that I don't dislike but right now that's about it. Just people I kind of don't dislike and tolerate.

Anyone who says internet friends aren't real friends are so fucking wrong. But we never follow through on voicechatting anymore. Like someone will say like for instance today it was ""hey lets voicechat tomorrow at 7:30"" and every time I would build my whole schedule and everything I'm doing after work to fit that time and they just dont respond when I ping them or say they're busy now. Jesus god fuck I am so goddamn lonely and desperate to have a conversation with someone I actually want to talk to. Having someone like the person I knew a year ago would be a fucking miracle right now. Like if I actually met and knew them in real life but I really don't think that could ever happen again and I fucked it up."

My gfs was about her manipulative ex who made her do shit she was really uncomfortable with. It was going fine I was getting funny drunk snaps but then one of her friends starts talking about the rice purity test. I found out her score is 52 and mostly cause of jackass (her ex). After I found out Itâs just been fucking with me and I donât know why. I have a 75 or something of that nature which may be why but like why is this fucking with me. It shouldnât matter but it really does to me. I texted her goodnight and havenât really spoken to her since. She asked if something was wrong I just said Iâm tired. I really donât know what to do here and I know this is a stupid problem but itâs really messing with my head.

"Answering the age old question of why dudes get praised for having high body counts while women get slut shamed Itâs a simple answer, for decently attractive women it takes absolutely no effort to get a man, there are so many dudes throwing themselves a lot of the time, especially really pretty girls. it would take no effort to sleep with one of the guys she knows if you are a somewhat attractive girl. 

Men get praised because getting a girl as a man is pretty damn hard, going up to girls and having the confidence to talk to a stranger is pretty impressive when you consider the fact the most girls would be too shy or nervous to go up to a guy, it takes genuine effort and confidence for guys because they are usually the one chasing, it takes actual skill since they usually carry the conversation, etc

Think about it like this, I used to work as a waiter for my first job and we relied on tips, imagine the number of tips representing a body count, there was girl, extremely shy she wouldnât say anything to the people to make the service better, but she was attractive, people tipped her ALOT of money solely because of her looks and her nice body, me, on the other hand, I was trying me best to never mix up the orders, had engaging conversations, and recommended them foods and drinks they ended up enjoying, I barely got any tips compared to her, even when I did it took way more effort since I had to understand the customers and the type of food they liked a recommended them things.No matter how attractive I am a girl isnât gonna tip me that much money compared to what the guys are tipping her 

Now imagine I was bragging to my friends about the extra money, they would congratulate me right, of course .since It took the effort to earn those tips, but why would the girls brag about her tips, she isnât gonna get praised for all those tips because they came easy"

I still remember the day my life took a turn, I met him. I decided to be who I was, to embrace this mess. But I still hate him a lot and love him in a way where words canât comprehend how I feel.

I canât get into this cycle of being alone again, my heart hurts so much. In fact, today all parts of my body hurt. 

I wish I could do something, somehow tell my head it is ok. But I canât seem to fathom how. 


Note -I had a massive trigger just a while back... (happen to depersonalise)... 
With the world looking so unreal, I made this mistake of trying to cook and ended up burning myself, the food and creating an ugly mess in the kitchen."
should i tell my school counsellor iâm suicidal?iâm at school right now and wrote a note about how suicidal i was but i donât know if i should give it to my counsellor. will i be hospitalised if i give her the note?
"Is there a way to suicide without hurting my family?I love my family and I don't want to hurt them so much, but at the same time living is not an option for me. 
People would say, don't do it, it would get better, suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but my problem is permanent."
Aggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh I cant waitCan't wait to get mugged or some shit and someone puts and end to this bullshit fuck I'm too pussy to do it myself
"Fighting the good fight, but I'm not winning.I'm really really desperate.  Two attempts so far.  Last attempt put me in the hospital.  I'm a 48 year old guy in the U.S.  I know I'm genetically predisposed to be like this.  Lost a brother to suicide.  Lost two more in a car wreck a year later.
I know I'm on borrowed time.  I know there's no cure, nothing to help me feel normal.
I just need to connect with other folks that can relate.  "

"when is the end going to comeEver since I was around the age of 5-6 believe it or not I wanted to die. I told myself that I would do it in the right time and I have nothing to loose.. But since I got older, I matured.. Its not so easy to leave everything behind.. I want the pain , sadness and dissatisfaction with life to disappear and me along with them.. But its so hard... to live with a body which wants to die and a mind constantly struggling. I own everything to my brother, mother, grandma and best friend.. They care so much about me and I feel like a failure in life, unable to do the same for them.. My brother is about to give up almost everything so I can have a better life.. He wants to invest in me and my future because my parents dont have the resources to do that... He believes in me in a way that I dont...... I am crying right now thinking of what could happen.. I am sick of letting everyone in my life down. I really dont know what to do, where would life take me. People say its easy to be young, its fucking not."
"public suicide ?im going to kill myself, not soon, but eventually. the thing is i really don't want my parents or siblings to be the one to find me because i know the image will never leave their head. what is a painless and quick way to die in public ?"
Im such a cowardI keep using my makeshift noose but pussyifg out before actually passing out.fuck my insticts. I just want to die 
"Iâve been hoping to die naturally for years nowItâs just small things like not wearing my seat belt or behaving really recklessly. I canât bring myself to actually do it, Iâm too scared of surviving and living with the consequences. Iâm too young and poor to afford an assisted suicide in a country that allows it. My SO gets nervous when we go to places with steep edges and what not because I will be reckless in vain attempts to slip and fall. People around me demonize suicide so much, so I donât want anyone to know I did it. I just want to die naturally. I hope for a fatal car wreck when Iâm driving alone or maybe one of these days alcohol poisoning will do the job for me. I want to try starving myself so people will think I have anorexia but Iâm a male and where I live/my family would just call me a fag. I hope I die soon"
I need to say something real.I'm not ok.
"i donât know why i feel suicidal, but i donât even think that matters anymore.today iâve felt the worst iâve felt in months. iâve had suicidal thoughts for months and years but today was one of the worst days since my attempt three years ago. i feel like iâm always fooling myself thinking iâm better now. that iâm happy and that i wonât ever feel like this again. but that never happens and iâm always back here. back in this never ending loop of wanting to die after thinking iâm okay now. the thing is that these thoughts never left. theyâve always been here, just in the backseat for a while until its decided iâm too happy. they never truly leave even though iâm always tricked into thinking they do. iâm so stupid. the worst part is, i donât even know what wrong with me. why am i like this? why canât i just be normal? i donât think i have bipolar disorder because i donât experience periods of prolonged mania. iâm just what i think is the normal me when iâm not depressed and wanting to kill myself. iâve forgotten the feeling of being normal. of having stable emotions and feeling healthy mentally. sometimes i wonder what iâm like without being mentally ill. for some reason, ever since i was young iâve thought that iâll die young. as i got older the feeling only intensified as morphed into thoughts of suicide. i canât help but think that itâs the inevitable. i feel like i think about suicide as much as i think about normal everyday other things. it should scare me how often i think of suicide after even the slightest bit inconvenience happens to me. but it doesnât. i think i should tell someone about this but iâm too ashamed and my last therapist may have ruined mental health professionals for me. sorry, this is a bit all over the place, but i wanted to tell someone about this."
"I'm an extrovert, and I have no more energyWe commonly say that extroverts need to be around people to recharge. However, it's not always easy to find people to recharge you. Maybe you don't have a lot of friends, and it's difficult for you to meet new people. Other times you may have a lot of friends but none of them can provide you the right type of recharge or validation.

I do have a lot of friends, but it's difficult for me to find validation because we're all so different. It's similar to feeling lonely at a party of people because you don't really fit in, or you can't find the qualities in people you need to make you feel like you belong. To make matters worse, I find the most effective forms of validation for me are through physical touch and quality time, something that's commonly associated with dating.

Recently, I've noticed patterns in my behavior that confirms my hypothesis. I've been intensely depressed for a month and a half now. Whenever I go on *quality* dates, my mood improves for a short time - sometimes a day, sometimes half a day. Eventually, it goes back down and the physical pain in my chest comes back in addition to the lack of motivation and energy. I've lost the ability to function. I can't eat, work, shower... I've lost 13 pounds in the last month. My body feels weak. It's giving up on me and I don't care enough to fix it. I'm ready to go.

Relying on external validation sucks, and it's not something I can control. No matter how many opportunities I give myself (dating apps, Reddit, social media), I can't force connections. I can't force people to want to hang out with me. In fact, it's come to the point where I've run out of new profiles on all the apps. It makes me feel really defeated. The more time passes without that validation, the more intense the pain, and ultimately the more I feel pushed to the edge."
"My parents wonât let me spend my own money I almost never spend money, I canât remember the last time I made a purchase over $10. I have saved up quite a lot over the years and the first time I ask to buy something worth $80 my parents wonât let me. 

They say I have to earn it and when I ask them how they wonât give me answers and say âfigure it outâ. I get good grades and donât get in trouble so they donât have much reason to not let me. Itâs really frustrating and I donât know what to do."

"giving upI'm at a point where I don't care anymore. I'm in my twenties, and too broke to make it on my own. I can't live at home, because the situation is toxic. I have a job, but rent is greater than my paycheck. No license, no car. Commute to work by bus. I desperately want my own place; I want to be happy and safe. But no matter what, I'll never have it. I'm too stupid to get a ""good"" job, or one that pays a decent salary. I have a degree, but I'm not skilled; I'm not competent enough. I can't take this."

"Wanting to Drop Off (Third Post, Shit Title)I keep posting here. I feel like I shouldn't. I don't know why. Things get better then get worse then repeat over and over again. Everything is a chore, a labor. I hate doing anything, yet there is nothing to do. Everything is so fucking far away. I wish I had a gun so badly. I am so lonely I can't begin to describe it. I want to connect with people. I want to be able to communicate. Sometimes I feel like I don't know how. Sometimes I feel like an alien. I was driving around earlier, crying, and thinking there's literally nothing here for me. I want to help the world. I want to see it get better. I really do. It's too far gone and I can't make myself be satisfied. I am living in perpetual fuck-ups mirrored by the world around me. I just want it to all end. I want to know that the people that were once in my life and decided to move on did so for good reason. They knew I was going nowhere, just toward the grave. They win. Everyone else. I know I'm not alone in feeling this way, but sometimes it just doesn't fucking help. I honestly don't know why I'm still alive now. I'll read a good book or see a good movie with a great message and think 'I'll apply that to my own life'. Then I never fucking do. I can't figure out how to change and honestly don't want to. But, I can't stay the same. I don't know what to do except blow my brains out. That sounds so comforting right now."

"i donât know how this works but i need helpiâm fourteen years old. i have been severely depressed since i started puberty at about age 9. i was diagnosed with ptsd, severe depression, and anxiety last year because a teacher noticed i was crying nonstop for days in class. after a couple of months, i was put on zoloft which made me
suicidal within the next two weeks. itâs august now and iâm a week and a half away from starting freshman year but i donât know if iâll even make it through the year
let me tell you a bit about myself:
i have never met my father. i donât even know if my mother knows who he is. my mother has been in and out of my life for god knows how long. she was/is an addict and i have not spoken to her in over a year while my grandmother keeps in contact with her. my grandparents have custody of me. i live with them along with my brother, aunt, uncle, and three cousins. i have a dog of my own. my grandmother is extremely abusive and a sick human being. she constantly belittles me and physically abuses me. sheâs a disgusting narcissist. i can never do anything well enough and her eyes and she never acts proud of me or that she cares about me. i have a scar on my stomach from where sheâs thrown her car keys at me while raging. if i were to type what all sheâs done i would be typing for hours.
i was groomed at age 12 by a 17 year old. my grandma find out and victim shames me until this day. she constantly brings it up and calls me a whore, say she doesnât expect anything more of me than for me to do it again. 
i have no friends. in sixth grade, i lost every friend i had. the only people i consider my friends bully me relentlessly, mock my weight, personality, and mental illness. itâs so hard for me to make friends. i feel hopeless whenever i talk to people, i always get blatantly ignored. iâm not âannoying.â iâm a nice person, i really am. i have a similar personality and sense of humor as most other kids my age, i just get very anxious sometimes.
i have been questioning my sexuality and gender identity for years. my grandmother has found this out multiple times and verbally harassed me about my sexual identity. i am bisexual.
i have a boyfriend. heâs my only friend and the only person i get along with. he means a lot to me and i donât want to hurt him in any way, heâs so sweet and cares about me a lot. 
i have been very suicidal lately. iâve self harmed to the point where i draw so much blood i almost pass out. 
i donât know how much i can take anymore. i feel so hopeless and nothing has helped. therapy, pills, âhealthyâ coping mechanisms. i want to kill myself. i know iâm young but i donât see a future. i canât survive the next 4 years in this house, it hurts to bad. i cry every single day. i donât know what to do and i feel so lost. what am i supposed to do now?"
"Iâve recently gotten over my anxiety, depression, and lack of general confidence in myself. But now for the first time ever I feel like leaving this place isnât so unreasonableI used to see myself as less than all those around me, Iâm not sure if thats necessarily changed, or even true, but I just donât really see the point in caring about that anymore. 


I feel like Iâve spent the past few years in an existential crisis and itâs finally come to a head. I used to rarely dream (or remember my dreams that is), if I did it was always vague. But lately my dreams have been extremely vivid. Iâve also had a series of terribly vivid nightmares as of late, they feel so real that in my waking state I question whether Iâm in one or not. I canât always discern what memories are real and what were just a dream.


I donât feel sexual attraction anymore. I used to be heterosexual, but these days even the most objectively attractive woman looks disgusting to me. All humans do, hell all organic life just seems gross. I donât even like looking in the mirror because realizing the pile of meat and bone looking back is me scares the hell out of me.


My own consciousness and the nature of our reality makes me very uncomfortable and I feel like itâs all fake, everything about it. It all feels off, like living in a dream.


I used to view suicide as pathetic, selfish, moronic. From a point of view it probably still is. But itâd sure be nice to escape from all this."
"How do you just keep hanging on?Ive been struggling with severe depression for years and tried a ton of different medications and nothing seems to be working. I cry at stupid happy Christmas movies or newspaper articles and I just feel horrible. Im so tempted to stop fighting it and just give in, it's like I'm battling myself everyday. How do you keep holding on when you're exhausted and ready to give up??"
"Coping with restrictions, loads of parental issues.I have never really been the type of person to say my feelings to other people, I guess that is just how I was raised by my parents. My father has never really been there but I know that he is out there trying to support the family and all that jazz but if you ask me about my father I could just sum it up as him being there. We've never interacted before more than just hi and hello. 

On the other hand my mother is a contradiction of everything. All things she says she contradicts and she's saying somethings but shows differently, I really don't get it anymore. 

For the past 6 years I have plans of ending it all and just dying. And today I'm planning of going out and buying everything I needed to just end it all. I just really want to be free of everything. My mother and my siblings all ask me what I want to do with my life and I know that they expect me to say that I will continue with my job and all those things normal people say, things I wish I could say but how could you say to them that all you ever wanted is to just end it all? How could you say to them that when they ask you how you see yourself in your 30s you don't reply because you're just seeing yourself dead? I remember saying to them before that I just want to kill myself and saying that I'm thinking of suicide and I remember feeling so belittled and alone at that time because everything just became a shouting match after that and of course accusations of being dramatic. Sure they were crying but I'm just there still as a rock, and in that moment I just remembered that moment when I tried really hard to ask for help and advice, crying to them for help and they asked me to never cry again. And I think I never cried in front of them anymore and I've never tried to ask them for anything anymore but I guess it just hurts even now when you know they'll never understand. No one understands. Watching every day, day in and day out that nothing ever changes is scary and so useless I just want to end it all. "

"Getting kind of desperateI'm 24 and have never had a real job. I know, the first thing that comes to mind is that I'm a loser, a slacker and that I'm not trying hard enough. I feel that way about myself, but I really don't know what I'm doing wrong. I left university at 22 with a bachelors degree in Psych, and for the past almost 2 years I've been applying to jobs, especially ones that don't even require a university degree just for the sake of trying to have a job, any job. At best I receive a letter of rejection, at worst I don't hear anything back. With each rejection letter I get more and more demotivated and dejected. And depressed.

I know the guidelines for r/suicidewatch say not to dispense ""tough love"" advice but I think I really need any help at all as to what I'm doing wrong. The sense of helplessness and the hopelessness after 2 years of unemployment is really getting to me. I feel like a burden on my family and I don't feel like I have any purpose or anything to live for. I avoid my friends or any social contact with anyone because I'm ashamed of having to answer the inevitable questions about what I'm doing with my life. I just sit in my room all day, every day, dependent on the internet to distract me from how miserable and useless I am. But then there are days where it hits me how my life is going nowhere and I'm essentially a parasite.

"I should be in a hospital right nowI just hurt myself really badly. Not like I'll die, but a lot of blood. The voices have gotten really bad (I have schizophrenia) and they say I am worthless and that my name is Worthless because that's what I am and I need to accept my new name , my true name, so I can make the world hell . This is the worst I've felt for a long time but I can't go to the hospital because people did bad things to me there, and if I get hospitalized, they'll see that I've been committed before and then they'll shut me up for good. I need help but I CAN'T, I have to do college and my job and not be even more of a disappointment. I can't stop self harming. I've attempted suicide probably twenty times. I'm not good at anything, even dying. I don't even have a therapist anymore to talk to. I fantasize about making people watch as I kill myself all the time. It's going to taste good and the blood will feel good and I'll have that happy feeling inside. the voices tell me I'm not worth spending time on this earth any longer and I need to transcend all of this and end it as I am.

But this is ap calc itâs a hard class! He also said I used tactics that he didnât teach and the my order of doing the problems was similar to how online calculators do them, BUT AGAIN I SERIOUSLY DIDNT CHEAT.

"I want it all to be overIâve been depressed and see no way out, Iâve gotten therapy and taken medication and have been thinking positive thoughts but thatâs all bs and not helping at all. All I want to do is die Iâve written my suicide note, ended my friendships, made a will, and distanced myself from my entire family. Iâve thought long and hard about this and how I should go through with it and Iâve made peace with it. I forgave everyone whoâs ever hurt me and now Iâm ready to let myself finally be at peace. 

I know what Iâm doing is something not a lot of people will understand and struggle with. This in the end is my decision and Iâm so so so tired of fighting against it. Life has worn me down and broken me, so I want to leave while Iâm still happy while Iâm still a person because I fear that my humanity is slipping and that I will fall into a pit of depression worse then the one I am in now.  Goodbye to whoever sees this, I will miss it but I wonât regret leaving it all behind."
"Don't give up yet, happiness does exist!I know, I know.  
Being depressed / lonely / suicidal can be hard.  
No, it IS hard. Been there, done that.
After trying to kill myself about 2 years ago I've been an empty shell.  
Feeling nothing but hate and despair, every day the same thoughts of hopefully getting fucked over by a drunk driver or smth.
Finding relieve in drugs and self harm, to forget that I am not loved and accept the fact that I'm dead inside.  

But let me tell you something - there is still hope!  
I hope it's okay to share something positive, cause I wanna let you know it doesn't have to be over yet.  
Being perfectly fine with trying to end my life one last time - a girl, ""full of life"" with sparkling eyes and a face straight out a magazine comes into my life, taking me on a rollercoaster full of emotions.  

The past weeks I've been loving, laughing, crying and hating.  
Her kisses makes my heart beat faster than my MDMA pills do.  
She makes me forget all the bad in life when she looks me in the eyes and I can truly be myself with her.  
Even tho' everything crashed together the last weeks - getting a drug charge, returning my driver license for some time and having to stop smoking weed (the only thing that ""kept me living"") - it all doesn't matter.  
I've been truly loved and was loving the past few days, and even tho' I know she won't be staying with me, even though I love her to pieces.. it's all okay.  

It's like she turned a switch in my head, letting me feel emotions I've forgotten.  
And when it's over and she'll be loving someone new - I'll be fine.
I will do everything to get these feelings back - I think now I know what I've been wanting all the time.  

Hopefully you will find the key to your happiness too. Every person deserves this, no matter what you've done or been through.
But I know for sure Imma try my best to live this life to the fullest and accepted the fact that life isn't always good - but we can try to make the best out of it.  

I know this won't help anyone with their problems, but I hope someone will think about his/her next step after reading this before they'll regret it.

love you all

"I graduated cum laude with an engineering degree from a high ranked university in Dec 2018, and I've spent all of 2019 bedridden thanks to debilitating social anxiety and depression and I feel just giving up is the only choice I haveI was supposed to have been the 'golden child' of the family and make it big as a 1st generation college student. Ever since I was found out to be 'gifted,' that's what was pushed on me all throughout junior high, high school, and university. But instead of being my family's golden child, I'm left as a bitter disappointment as I've spent all of 2019 essentially in bed thanks to my unmanageable social anxiety that prevents me from operating as a normal person, something my family never bothered to address and they hoped I would 'grow' out of it. Well instead of growing out of it, it turned into a deeply rooted personality disorder that I struggle everyday with just to not kill myself. Don't get me wrong, my university had a counseling center and psychiatric services that I tried to make use of. I went through several different counselors, psychiatrists, and medications that I can't even remember the names of, but nothing helps when it's that far buried in you.

How well you do in University does not show how well you'll do in real life. I only ever did the minimum - study and homework. I didn't have friends. I didn't do extracurriculars, internships, or research. Any free time I had I spent laying in bed watching something on my phone. I haven't even sent out a single resume at all since graduating because all I have on it is that I went to college, and that I know that I'm too nonfunctional to even be an engineer, let alone getting past a fucking interview. I'm probably going to have to settle for something like working at the local dollar store because that's all I can see myself realistically doing and hopefully not fucking it up. Each day, that degree loses value to employers and it's probably going to be worthless. Some golden child I am. I'm a complete lost at what I should do other than giving up and dying."
"Can someone be too broken?I spent many years being severely abused and it still affects me. Can someone be too abused to run a normal life? I tend to mess things up due to being re-traumatized and turning into something I'm not.

The most recent incident is with my girlfriend. She is everything I've ever wanted but after getting a message from an abuser inquering why I haven't killed myself yet, I misplaced my anger. I turned into someone she didn't know. I wasn't who she fell in love with. I messed it all up in the space of a week and she doesn't know how much more she can take. She is everything to me. I can't lose her. I'm trying to fix it. I'm getting on meds, seeing a therapist multiple times a week, and proving that wasn't who I really, but I don't know if it will work. 

Every time I hug her I have trouble letting go because I feel like she will leave me. I kiss her so hard hoping she will feel my love and reciprocate. I know she loves me but I'm too much. I can't say it to her, but I don't want a future if she isn't in it. She is what made all the other pain worth it. I recognize that is too much for one person to deal with so I try not to let that across to her. 

If we break up, it will only prove I'm too broken. I can't go on without her and even if i could, I truly don't want to. I already know what to do when the day comes. It won't be her fault. It's my fault. It's all the other pain that I've dealt with finally reaching me."

"Shame for being transgender.I will never be the son Iâm supposed to be. I want to have kids. I just want a god damn dick. My girlfriend deserves better than this. My dysphoria has been so bad tonight. I canât even look down for too long or else Iâll want to disappear from disgust and embarrassment. I hate this body, itâs not mine. No amount of surgery, hormones, or money will change my biological birth. Im never going to accept the fact I wasnât born male. How am I supposed to put on a smile and say that this is my body? Everyday I literally feel like screaming and tearing out my guts and throat. If I could be cis for a day, it would make my year. My mind is constantly filled with âif only...â and âwhat if...â. It gets tiring. The pain becomes physical. Do people really feel pride or is it just a facade to make themselves okay? I canât fake it anymore. My life is fucked because Iâm trans. Iâm never going to be a real man, but Iâm also not a girl. Iâm just nothing. I donât deserve to be alive anyway. Iâm a disgusting mutation. I feel so guilty and ashamed but Iâm too exhausted to cry. Nothing will help. I want to die. I just want to be fucking normal for once in my life, instead of the outsider like I always am."

"I know I don't say it much but..I am glad I'm still here after my many suicide attempts..These last few years have been some of the hardest that I could ever go through. And I wasn't sure that I would ever accept the fact that I have a purpose. Though, I am still finding that purpose, I know I won't stop breathing cause that happiness is out there somewhere, I just know itð"

"help please hi everyone ok so this is whatâs going on- i met this girl on discord through my friends right? weâve been just playing minecraft and whatnot. just hanging out. and then a couple days ago my friend told me that she liked me, which was really obvious, come to think about it. BUT the problem is, she lives in a different state (about 900 miles away). i really like her but weâre only 14 and theres no chance of us actually being together irl. i just dont know what to do. ik that it probably wouldnât work out if we tried long distance, but i want her so much. any advice will be appreciated."
"My dad finally having the son he always wanted after 2. So my parents had told us that my mom was pregnant and hoping it's a boy. My brother is 21 and I'm 18. My dad's name is JesÃºs and mine and my brother's is Jimmy and Jesse. He said he always wanted to name their first kid his own name but my brother never got that. Neither did I. So now that my parents know about how me and my brother, my brother kinda being irresponsible sometimes and me having ADHD and having my head cracked opened twice but only in minor damages, they hope the new kid doesn't disappoint them like we did."
"My dog keeps me from committing suicideSchool is approaching in a couple weeks and as always itâs made me stressed and suicidal. But whenever I get like this I feel so guilty for my dog. That Iâm just gonna leave her like that. Of course my family can take care of her but I donât want to hurt her. Sometimes I convince myself my dog doesnât like me and âitâs just an animal she wonât care.â But I canât get over the guilt. Itâs so conflicting. My mental health prevents me from being able to play with her as much as she deserves, so I convince myself sheâs better off without me. But then Iâm scared of hurting her emotionally and thinking I just abandoned her. I hate this and I canât even get myself to cry about it. "
"A day does not past I wish I wasnât aliveI feel like everything is pointless. I have been in therapy for 1.5 years now (was in previously and took a âsabbaticalâ as I thought I was better) and do not feel like Iâm improving mental health-wise at all. I have tried switching therapist to ones more centered around my needs like trauma coping and such, but that seems to be a dud, too. 

Iâm really feeling hopeless and want to stop trying. Not a day goes by where I donât wish I were dead. I wish I had the courage to end it all and have tried in the past. I think thatâs why I donât do it. To attempt and fail is a wake up call for me in the sense that I want to make sure I do it right next time. 

I honestly feel like itâs the only way to take away the pain."
"I did some experiments My first experiment was - how long can an average kid run? 

In january, a year ago i went outside and decided to do this experiment. It took me 4 hours and around 20 minutes to run 11km (i speak dont miles). I didnt run fast cuz i wanned to save energy but im sure i can do better now.

And no sleep experiment. My score was 40 hours. Yeah thats not that much but it was my first time. I experienced 2 hallucinations. It isnt good but i will fucking try again.

Which experiment should i do next?"

Want to leave alreadyI want to just want to start my plan to end it all. Why should my family or anyone care if I die? Itâs my life and I want to end it now. When I kill myself they should just move on the from fact and continue their lives without me. Like I just disappeared. I just want to be forgotten and dead.
"My quarantine project Sup guys?
So I have a question: would you join a discord server to meet new people without leaving your home during quarantine?

Both my parents tested positive, so I canât leave my house for about 2 weeks, and I need something to spend my time with. Then I came up with meeting new people because Iâve hardly seen anyone since the whole corona thing started. So I want to make a discord server for playing games, hanging out or whatever you wanna do. But it feels kinda pointless to set up a whole server for just me. So I kinda want some assurance that at least somebody will join.

Yeah I think thats all I wanted to say, so let me know.

See ya!"

"So I've been kicked out of the hosueWell my relationship with my perents is ok usually. We have our fights like any other family would but we normally all make up in the end. I'm 17 and I've just gone thought my summer exams. I have ad a past of anxiety and have attempted suicide once. I thought those days were behind me but today. I paniced and had a little breakdown before my exams. I ended up running out of school and I effectively skipped it (note that these exams are not really important as they dont play a direct role in my future). Anways o told my pearents and they were mad. When I got home iw a the only one there ( as everyone was at work). When my parents got home well shit went down. They shouted at me I shouted at then I tired to explain about the breakdown and they werent having it.anyways they told me to get out of the hosue and here I am its 1 am and I'm staying at a friend hosue for the night.
This is the first time somthing like this has happened
I feel sick
My parents didnt text me to see where I was staying the night and ngl that worried me.
It hurt
Is this normal? Is it normal to have these kind of fights? 
Would also like to add that I am nothing haveing suicide thoughts or anything like that
Sorry if this doesnt make sense"

"Probably going to kill myself sometime this monthI'm only writing this because I can't tell anyone in my life because I'll just get sent to hospitals, which would make me feel more uncomfortable than it already is. 

I've been unemployed for nearly a year, my last job lasted only a few months before my life crumbled, lost my girl and my puppy and in turn had a panic attack and was relieved of work.

I messed up my chances with welfare, I lied about some things that I can't fix, so have been rejected. I don't even have the requirements to qualify (a place to rent) 

I'm in too much debt for student loans, my family is doomed for failure and I think I've burned all of my options.

"This meat sack is hard to killI tried to kill myself on Friday night.

"My note, sort of.New account because I don't want the friends linked to my old one to see this for obvious reasons.

I have just been writing down my thoughts the past months/weeks, I call it the logical choice, thought it would be of help to someone to post it here (I guess).

&amp;#x200B;

//note

In this document I will simply be writing down my reasoning and thought patterns on this subject.

&amp;#x200B;

Although, should such a fate be in my future, I hereby shall write an unofficial short statement:

\- My remains shall be buried properly in a location my relatives see as fit, do not mistake this as me caring about my remains, this will just bring my relatives closure.

\- All of my belongings shall be equally distributed amongst my brother and sister, besides the following items:

	\- \[private item #1\]

	\- \[private item #2\]

	\- \[private item #3\]

&amp;#x200B;

Suicide is broadly seen as a selfish choice, although in some cultures it is seen as a way of redeeming your family's honor if you have brought shame upon them,

if one takes their relatives and other close ones out of the equasion, suicide can be seen as a logical choice.

&amp;#x200B;

Your own lifeform seizing to exist will have no impact on the universe, since energy cannot be destroyed, it will simply transfer somewhere else.

A human lifespan is so insignificant in comparison to the universe, we might aswell never have existed in the first place, in 100 years your impact on those close to you will have faded too.

&amp;#x200B;

Animals are not aware of their own mortality, thus they don't have to deceive themselves into believing a purpose which only serves to distract them from the fact that death is inevitable and that their life is completely insignificant in the grand scheme of the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

I find myself not capable of following the logic of other suicidal people, all of them put so much emotion and irrational thoughts into this final decision.

Unlike these people I do not feel joy or sadness thinking about this particular subject, as the name of this document says, I simply find it a logical choice if you do not consider other people their feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

I have overcome all hardships life has offered me so far, and have lived through many moments of joy in between, I just came to the conlusion that my life is trivial and does not matter in the grand scheme of all things, and I came to the conclusion that simply waiting for death to come and fade slowly into nothingness is simply illogical.

Instead why not choose for a quick and easy way out, while your body is still in (semi-)decent shape, and you do not have any real physical complaints (besides scars, open tissue with dead nerve endings, ...).

&amp;#x200B;

My emotions have been flatlined by psychiatric medication, so I could behave normally in a way that others deem so, which has made my life extremely boring, I feel neutral about practically everything.

I do not have any desire to do anything, nothing peaks my interest, even our primal behavior of finding mates/procreation does not interest me anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

People would obviously make the arguement in my place ""well just stop taking them"", but then comes life with daily paranoia, visual &amp; auditory distortions and anger triggered by the most random events.

&amp;#x200B;

In short:

I do not see the purpose of living a life being incapable of enjoying it, or the life of a social reject.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you want from me?

Why don't you run from me?

What are you wondering?

What do you know?

Why aren't you scared of me?

Why do you care for me?

When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

&amp;#x200B;

Update on my personal feelings/thoughts:

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped taking my medication, since I feel it does nothing for me but keep me from feeling anything at all, I haven't slept properly in weeks, my thoughts keep getting darker and darker again, the sounds I keep hearing keep getting more frequent, waking up to my own voice shouting at me has also happened a few times now, I feel like everybody is talking behind my back, can't go outside alone without having the feeling somebody is looking at me, I find myself looking over my shoulder every 30 seconds or so.

I keep thinking my neighbors are home, yet they arent, it keeps getting harder to find joy in anything, I cannot find myself capable of finding a partner, since I am too emotionally unstable and my thoughts fuck me up every time somebody tries to get close to me, I don't want to get close to anyone, because I know I'll end up hurting them and/or end up pushing everybody away because they would be better off psychologically without me, yet I feel starved of love.

I just want someone I can love eternally who won't betray me, but I don't think it would matter even if I let them get close, since as previously mentioned I would just end up hurting them.

Fighting for the only people that ever truly cared about me has left me with countless scars on my hands, back, face, chest and knees, and it is hard for me to find somebody who even accepts what I did in the past to get by.

Yet against all odds I found somebody who is quite the opposite of me, and still understands me, a girl simple in nature who is sweet, kind, smart, all good perks a person could ever have, but I don't see/talk to her as often anymore.

Talking to her clears my head of bad thoughts as long as I'm around her and makes sleeping easier, my deepest wish is to just hold her in my arms, our fingers locked together, kiss her and just drift away, but she probably just sees me as another friend, which is probably for the best.

I don't know how long I can keep going with this joyless, loveless and meaningless life while my mind keeps drifting further away.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't cried in years now, not even at funerals, close friends dying, family members litteraly drinking themselves to death and I still can't, I feel like doing so, but I can't.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though my body is in a trash state, and has had to endure years of substance abuse, I still hope that atleast some of my organs can still be useful as donations.

I do not hold grudges towards anybody and nobody should think its ""their fault"", some of you probably saw this coming though, I do want to thank the following people for making a difference in my life:

\- \[Best friend\]

\- \[Sister\]

\- \[Brother\]

\- \[Childhood friend #1\]

\- \[Childhood friend #2\]

&amp;#x200B;

I keep seeing people on suicide threads that try to make it out as if ""this is just a dark period in your life, things will get better, etc"" and all that other bullshit, it never gets better, they try to apply some logic that worked in their life to yours, my feelings of indifference towards the subject have moved to a final breath of relief.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey \[girl mentioned in the section about personal feelings\], thanks for brightening my last weeks, it's probably better that I don't write anything directed towards you, since you had no idea about my feelings towards you and how you helped me, anyway, just know that I love you and because you love the show, I couldn't not include this:

See you space cowboy.

Sorry for the screams at night, if you even heard them at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Please forget about me,

Bye."
"I try my best to live a full lifeI eat healthy. I exercise. I keep my house relatively clean. I go out to try and celebrate little successes with a dinner or movie with my husband. We own and operate our own business together. I play with my cats and dogs. I do all of the things ânormalâ people are supposed to do... 

And still, all I can think about is how badly I want to kill myself every day. I am young, just 25, but thinking about living, even just for a few more years, seems absolutely miserable. 

My OCD gives me crazy obsessive thoughts about people from my past, past mistakes, guilty feelings, having a baby, and suicide. I literally think about my first boyfriend from high school every single day/night still. We broke up 7-8 years ago, both are married, and him and his wife are pregnant with their first child. I am so happy for him to have escaped me so young, found a nice and beautiful woman to settle down and have kids with. I know deep down that I am happy for his happiness, but my OCD gives me these terrible, terrible thoughts that I just canât live with. 

I think about how badly I want to be pregnant and have a baby (hormones) all the damn time and husband and I are considering but Iâm so fucking suicidal that how could I bring a baby into my fucked up world? But itâd probably keep me alive at least during that time. 

I want a normal life so bad but I canât have one. Every time we start to think life can be normal, another consequence from one of our pasts comes up and makes life extremely difficult again.

I want to move. Pack up and move with my family somewhere far away. But weâre poor. And every time we try to make money, we binge spend it all on âfunâ things to try to make ourselves happy again instead of saving it to actually pack up and leave and maybe have a chance at real happiness. 

Iâm so lost. I donât want to try anymore. All of my days are becoming mental health days and nothing helps me feel better. I want to crawl into a cave and sit in the fetal position until I die. Maybe attempt to climb Mt Everest so I can die cold and peacefully frozen to death, experiencing beautiful nature. 

I keep telling myself that if I get to my next birthday, the anniversary of my momâs suicide, without leaving, that I will kill myself that day. But now January is approaching much more rapidly than I thought it would, and itâs very unlikely we will stumble upon enough money to move or travel in that amount of time, especially with holidays coming up. 

Everyone says life gets better, but as I age, it just keeps getting worse. The âbest years of your lifeâ are supposed to be your early 20âs and I spend all that time in an toxic and mentally abusive relationship, drinking a lot of alcohol and doing a ton of drugs to cope, spiraling myself into an infinite loop of fucking up my life, paying for it, and trying to piece it back together constantly. Mistakes me or my husband made 4-6 years ago creeping back and biting us in the ass now. Running us out of our town. Plus endless family drama to boot. 

I could go on forever. Why my life sucks. Why I hate myself. I could also give you a few reasons to live but the list is infinitely shorter than the list of reasons to die. But Iâm probably too much of a pussy to ever go through with it anyways. Too broken to live, to scared to give myself the relief I crave. Great. "
"My suicidal ex won't stop messaging me about how she's going to kill herself.Some of you may have seen my post from before where I went into detail about my suicidal girlfriend. Since then, we have gotten into a giant argument that ended up with me being arrested. After that fight, we broke up. This happened about a week ago and everyday since she has been texting me saying how she wants to kill herself and how it's all my fault. I broke up with her in hopes that we could both be independent and find help to become better, healthier people. While I am still trying to do those things, she is just making me feel a whole lot worse at every turn. She constantly blows my phone up with things like ""hope you don't bring girls to my funeral"" and ""I'm gonna start writing suicide notes"" and it has left me in the worst situation yet. I am trying so hard to focus my energy on bettering myself but it seems she only wants me to feel as worse as possible. All I want is for her not to kill herself. But I can't fall back into the trap that was our relationship. ANY advice is appreciated. She is trying to ruin my progress which I'm scared will lead to me becoming suicidal."
"I want it all to be overI feel like I'm trapped in a glass cage,chained up by guilt,loneliness, sorrow and self hatred. No matter how hard I try to escape I'm trapped.

I keep on entertaining the idea of just ending it all as if my only point is just death, and the only time people will care is when Iâm dead. Iâm exhausted and no matter how many breaks I take, depression always rears its head. I find no enjoyment in life."

"Why does suicide have to be contagious?First off: 21, Male, Gay, United States

Throwaway account. I haven't shared this before.

I lost my best friend a year ago to suicide. He was gay as well. I never knew he was struggling and now I'll never know why. It sounds so cliche, but my life feels so empty now. He was such a large part of my childhood that I can hardly look at anything now without seeing it as a reminder of the life that once was. I thought that I would have long since moved on by now, but I still cry as though he just died yesterday.

I'm not proud of who I am. I would give anything to ""un-gay"" myself so that I wouldn't have to feel like I have to hide my feelings and desires. I've constantly lived in the shadow of my successful older siblings. They've all had successful (heterosexual) relationships and are due to get married in the coming months. The girls' families have basically become our family. My parents have opened their arms wide with excitement to the new additions. I can't ever see that happening if I ever find someone. I feel like my parents would have a patronizing, condescending attitude towards any relationship I'd have with another man, and it would be the hardest thing for them to welcome any new in-laws.

Then there's me: the gay son. I've never come out to my family because I'm just too ashamed to have that conversation with them. I can't do it until I have more self esteem, but the longer I wait for it to appear out of nowhere, the more I realize I'm not going to like my gay self ever. I don't see much of a bright future. I want desperately to share my life with somebody who's more than just a friend, but have only found awkward one night stands which I so deeply regret. I see no examples of healthy homosexual relationships. Only fragmented, shallow, sexual attractions between two horny gay guys. I want to be able to see myself living as a successful, happy, gay, partnered/married middle-aged man someday, but I'm starting to think such a life doesn't exist - for anyone!

I never thought of suicide at all until after my best friend did it. I was generally happy, and didn't mind that I had some feelings in high school for other males that didn't quite jive with social norms. I told myself that it was just hormones and I'd grow out of it soon enough. But now, living with my close friends (who all are in steady, long term relationships) I get so jealous. Jealous that they have it so easy. They won't spend their entire lives defending who they are to intolerant bigots. Jealous they can just ""go with the flow"", but my homosexuality sticks out like a red flag despite trying so hard not to let it. I don't want it to define me, but rather just to be one of many facets.

I feel guilty having suicidal thoughts. They shouldn't be happening to someone who has been as fortunate as me. I came from a stable loving home, I have two wonderful parents and older brothers (none of whom know I'm gay), and I'm getting an all-expenses paid college education. I read the entries of others here who come from broken homes with no parental figures, who grew up surrounded by drug and alcohol abuse, shackled by massive debts and I feel weak. I've been given every opportunity to succeed and I just can't talk myself off the ledge because I lost a friend and want to lie down with another man? There are literally billions of people who don't even know if they're going to see food today and I'm sitting in one of the wealthiest countries on Earth thinking ""Oh, woe is me!"". Pathetic. Although thoughts like these keep me going, they're not what should be my motivation for continuing to live.

For the last 12 months, all I've been able to think about is death, specifically my own suicide. These thoughts terrify me. I catch myself daydreaming about how I could kill myself: bridges, guns, driving off cliffs. It feels like my friend's suicide has infected me now. It should have been a deterrent, but instead it set a horrible example: when times get tough, just end it all. He did it. So can I. Yet I don't want to. And yet I do.

I turn now to the anonymous internet. I've never shard much of this with anyone, just bits and pieces here and there. I love you, redditors, especially those of you who have the compassion to respond to troubled strangers on /suicidewatch you'll never meet. I laugh my ass off in the morning when I read the front page, especially the comments. I even laugh when my own attempts at posting fail miserably. Such joy is merely temporary, lost as soon as I get off my computer and see a couple holding hands as they stroll down the street in love. I'm not sure what I hope to get from posting this here. I think just knowing that someone somewhere out there gives a damn, even about a total stranger miles away can at least provide some solace. Thank you for sticking with me.

"Out of timeThe older you get the harder it is to fix your life. I'm about to turn 29 and I have no degree, no friends, no skills, no family, no training. I dropped out of high school at 16 because of social anxiety and have not progressed as a person since. I've worked dead end jobs and isolated my free time away, I haven't grown as a person or experienced anything in 12 years.  I'm done working shit jobs for $10 an hour and would rather die peaceful than fight for survival homeless"
"The end will always be the same for meOnce again I've come to a conclusion that it can't actually get fully better. It just stops getting better and you can't so anything. It's worse than it just being bad. Cause you know it was pointless and you can't win. I hate how much I don't give a fuck about anything. The only things stopping me are my pets. Everyone will eventually be happy without me. No problems, no screams, just a happy family without that piece of shit. Why do they love me if I dissappoint them so much? I just want them to finally let go. I don't want help or comfort, I want them to mind their own life and accept the choice I made. Last week it was my birthday and I hope it was the last one. I'm fonna make sure this time. The only thing I regret in life is not killing myself when I wanted to. Now I just need to do it. I have to. This is a reminder to myself that I shouldn't give myself any hope and if I'm hesitating about it, I should just do it. If you want to kill yourself, because you really don't want to be alive, don't let people stop you, but seek some help if you want to, but just don't know how."
"I'm like a hurricane that wrecks everything around meHey. So I guess I'm just done, I am in so much pain all the time. 

I have had depression and some other stuf for a while, (6-7 years, I am 19) and I'm going to therapy and have meds. Well I'm only now being moved to ""real therapy"" hopefully with a psychologist. 

I've tried once seriously, like I ended in the hospital getting my stomach pumped. I was 14. My mom (single parent) was too drunk to get on the ambulance with me. I got home next day. A bit later I was committed for a while for suicidal thoughts and self-harm. Being there was nice, but my mom was so worried about me missing school that I also thought it would be just better to ""just thoughen up"". Things haven't really gotten better though. I now see my self ending like my mom, alone, in bad health, addicted to alcohol and very few brain cells left.

I am in big trouble at school. I basically can't graduate unless I complete a course before autumm that I actually failed the 3rd time this spring. I'm basically fucked. My therapist has been trying to see if there could be any exemptions made at school, but I don't feel like I'm exception-worthy. All I do is drink, smoke weed, sleep, and watch the occasional self-help video while leaving in a pig's nest. I've tried to be sober, I've tried exercise but I have bad anxiety being around people in general. I try to keep active in my home. I am the classic ""nightwalker"". 

Well that doesn't sound that bad of a life you may say? It isn't. I know it could be worse. I just don't see myself getting on a track that would stop everything from slowly collapsing. I know I'm in a vulnerable state since I don't have a job and customer service is too fuckin much for me to do ever again. I could be homeless. 

The worst WORST WORST thing of all is being unloved and having no real friends. I've been that way most of my life. My dad took off, and my mom detested me from the day I could talk. Personality-wise we're like night and day. She couldn't wait to kick me off to boarding school at 13 and later totally by 16. She didn't support me while I was getting on my own. I have debt. My dad and I never got close. He sends me money sometimes, that's about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was bullied a lot. I don't really have any close friends, and I have these words from my mom printed on my RAM ""I'm not your friend. You need to get real friends."" while I was 7 or 8. She also around this time brought a 20-year old muslim man from Morocco to live with us. He wanted to be my dad. I wanted to see my real dad. He wanted to change us into a traditional religious family. There we're a lot of fights. I have a scar on my foot from standing near while he broke a plate. He also broke my phone. He was high-maintenance and my mom got into a lot of debt 'cause she only had a cleaners salary. 

When they eventually broke up we had to move into an apartment where I didn't even have my own bedroom or bed.  It took 3 years for us to get seperate beds. I think my mom delayed the process because she wanted someone to sleep with her 'cause she got lonely and sad and started drinking a lot. She got angry at me for the smallest things. Once she said she would cut my head off after I went to bed with a chainsaw 'cause I wouldn't help her at Candy Crush ""even though you know video games"" I doubt if she even remembers those nights. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I got to be on my own I was looking for something and I found it.  My first love. We were together for 2 years. We still kept touch but I've only reacently managed to be too unstable for even him. We haven't been hanging out a lot and I've been so so so lonely.

I guess that's the short story of my life. IDK what I'm looking for but I'm just so sad all the time and I want it to stop. I've been making plans. The only way I see myself ending up is a sad miserable idiot like my mom 'cause she's the only one I've truly related to."
"okay so last night I had a dream about one of my close(?) friends Idk what's that supposed to mean. so the thing is, we haven't really talked or met since quarantine began early this year. we texted like once or twice idek, but we were really close before all this shit went down. Should I text him or nahh, I already tried texting him like 2 months ago but we had a conversation and it was over then and there. idk what to do"

Well. Itâs been more or less six months since then. The kids in my class have been outcasting me, and Iâve gone to every single counselor about it. Theyâve done nothing. Iâve calmly made a statement about transferring to another school to my parents. They yelled at me for even bringing it up, and that I should focus more on grades and not even have any friends. My only friend (mentioned in the last post) is drifting away from me. Heâs made plenty of friends, who are far more interesting than Iâll ever be. Tomorrow is my schoolâs formal; Iâll be sulking off in the corner while all the happy people with dates are loving life. I just want to fucking die, every night I fantasize about how everyone I know will react. In reality, no one will say anything. Even though everyone pretends to care. "
"my life is miserableim 17.

my parents are acting like they are gonna get a divorce and i cant help but feel like im part of the reason why.

my ex is accusing me of abuse to all my friends.

my friends are fake as fuck.

im smart but i cant handle school.

i should be going to college next year but im afraid im not going to be able to handle it.

i feel so alone.

i spend every night thinking about how useless i am in the grand scheme of things.

im sorry for letting everyone down."
"My inevitable returnI don't feel good anymore. I just feel sad, and empty. I feel disgusting. 

I felt awesome for a short while, probably the happiest i've been in a while, but I just feel empty now. I've ruined something for someone who greatly cares about me."
"Need helpI was in a seriously abusive relationship with someone who undoubtedly has sociopathic tendencies. Ever since I've gotten out of it 6 weeks ago, I've been seeing a therapist twice a week which has been helping. Every single time he asks me if I'm suicidal I lie because I don't want to end up in a psych ward or make my life anymore difficult. I know the pain will lessen over time and it has, but it's such a tremendously hard uphill battle. I'm very fortunate and privileged to have a lot of people care about me but sadly ever since this relationship I've learned the extent of human selfishness. We're all going about our own lives concerned with our own problems. Never in my life have I had suicidal thoughts before but now they are stronger than ever. I really don't know what to do, but I really don't feel like I'll ever be okay. "
"I have failed at everything in lifeIâve always been stupid and had bad grades. All id do in middle and high school is homework, studying, and watch tv. I was bullied and had no friends. Iâm in college and my social skills are still fucked. I have no friends. My grades are horrible. Iâve tried so many clubs and groups and canât fit in anywhere. Iâm just meant to be alone. No one had ever liked me. I bet if I interviewed everyone who has met me theyâd say they want me dead.

No I donât have family who cares about me. They expect me to burn in Hell. Iâm a disappointment and embarrassment. Iâd probably feel the same if I produced an ugly, stupid, tranny child. Everyday I hope I get killed or hit by a car. Each night I go to sleep hoping I donât wake up. Iâm an unwanted pos that shouldnât have been born. Iâm my wanted. People just donât want to be upset for a few weeks after my death. After that theyâre back to their lives."
"So I did some research and... Im a bastard child 

So like im a bastard apparently, thats pretty coolð"
Why do I want to die right now?Everything is going fine for me. Iâm just so fucking anxious. Over what? I have no idea. Iâm fantasizing about what it would be like to not wake up tomorrow. Why am I like this? I feel like this is more of just an acknowledgment that I feel this way. Iâm not doing anything. But I hate that I want to.
"I have a plan to kill myself at the beginning of January 2020.I was going to drive out to a stargazing place area and take some meds + alcohol in a combination that I know will kill me. Since I decided to do that, I started on some anti-depressants and started seeing more of my family friends.  Iâve been much more open with my thoughts and to people, because fuck it right? Since I started living like this, Iâve had a lot more highs and also a lot more lows as well. Iâm having second thoughts about my plan since living like this has made me feel a little better."
"I am feeling so horny, that I want Rule 34 art of my OC. Please help. Let the horny get away from me."
"Relapsing, past issues are still hereI feel ashamed of my mental health issues. I started struggling at 15 years old, with social anxiety, self harm, depressive episodes, suicidal thoughts and ideation...never talked about my problems, my family still doesnt know.  Now I'm 22, still struggle with social anxiety but its better...but I feel ashamed bc I'm self harming again, I self harmed 2 weeks ago, I got angry with my father that always criticize me. I also feel depressed again, I'm studying at university but I doubt myself a lot. How can I find jobs with social anxiety? I still struggle when I talk with others. I feel lost, I think about suicide, I'm afraid I'll kill myself if I don't find my path, my purpose. I wanted a job where I could help people, I did 3 years at university for this and I really wanted to and still want to help! But how can I help if I'm struggling? 

I feel like a burden...I'm wasting my parents money. If I kill myself they don't have to waste money for me anymore. Tomorrow I'll call a new therapist I really need one!...I'm ashamed because I'm relapsing with everything. But I'm afraid I'll start therapy and don't get better then what?ï»¿"
"I've been teeter-tottering on the edge for the past few monthsWhich isn't saying much, since I think about suicide a lot. But lately, I've really wanted to go through with it. I'm just tired, I'm tired of being tired and life is sucking everything out of me and I can't stand it any longer. I don't trust any government institutions like therapists, I've taken so many different kinds of pills only to have them fuck me up worse than I already was or just not work at all. I can't even talk to my therapist about the things that bother me because they never understand or I could go to prison if I did. My health is shit, it keeps getting worse and the shit doctors I keep going to tell me everything is fine, I just need to lose weight - even though I already have a eating disorder (and lost 100 pounds, and I'm not even that fat) and can't exercise very much due to my shitty health. Speaking of shitty health, I can't work anywhere because of it and so I'm destined to be on disability my entire life. I can't even afford my basic needs, I have to steal from the grocery store just to be able to eat a nutritious diet that doesn't consist of mostly sugar, calories and salt. I am going to end up homeless because rent everywhere is getting way too expensive for me to even afford and every place that offers housing assistance is packed full (I hate apartment living anyways), and I'd actually prefer homelessness, if it meant that I didn't have to live with a shitty roommate (which I've only had 2 roommates ever who weren't shitty abusive people). I can't do relationships or get close to anyone, I'm too PTSD'd about trauma from shit that has been done to me by other people all of my life and I can't get close to anyone because I have to keep important details of my life hidden away from people, so I basically have to be dishonest with people in order for anyone to even want to be in my life. Meditation, I don't get...some new age BS that doesn't accomplish anything for me. I've tried CBT exercises, that doesn't work either because a lot of it is wishy washy BS (or is at least presented that way) and doesn't reflect reality, especially my reality.

I could go on and on about how my entire life is one great big shit show (including all the bullying, rapes, abuse from parents and teachers, having kids who don't even know my name, etc.), but it would take forever and doesn't help anything. The main point is that I don't really remember having any genuinely happy moments in life other than small things that happen once in a blue moon that I quickly lose interest in. I might get a bit excited to be able to try a food, watch a new movie or show, or a new song I found...but it's super rare, like a couple times a year sort of rare. Everything else is just constant misery, me feeling like a prisoner in my own skin and of a society I never gave permission to participate in. If I could change my circumstances, I would. I have literally exhausted just about every option that I could take to make my life better. I don't have any options except for saving up money for literally YEARS just to be able to make/record music in hopes I can make some sort of liveable income from that and isolate myself off grid until I have to do a music tour somewhere, and I can't wait that long and don't think my health could even allow me to do that, especially not 10 years from now. I am at my wits end. I am really thinking that maybe the best thing for me, is to not exist anymore in order to end the damn near constant misery I feel. I am already thinking about how to plan my death, including figuring out where my cat will go, funeral options, exit plan, etc. I don't want to die TBH, but dying seems a heck of a lot better than spending another 32 years hating my life and everything in it....except my cat."
"Not suicidal, just asking a question to suicidal and formerly suicidal people: What music helped you get through the hard times?I've posted here many times before but for the first time in a while I can say I'm quite happy and not suicidal at all. That's remarkable for me so I'm taking a bit of time to reflect on my past and what helped me get through difficult times in my life.

Personally music was incredibly therapeutic for me and I found that depressing or somber songs helped me feel a little less alone. However that's just me, does anyone else have any comments on how music plays a role in helping one through sadness, pain, loneliness, etc?

"Giving God an ultimatumI'm a 17 year old guy, single, homeschooled, ""Christian"", and I'm screaming inside. I fucking hate myself and I don't understand why God hasn't killed me yet. 

I read all these blogs and posts where the advice is to go see a professional or talk to someone close to you, but I'm only 17, still at home, and no way to privately contact a professional for help. I can't talk to anyone in my family or the few friends I have because I'm terrified of being treated differently. 

Last night I carefully planned out how I could attempt to kill myself and if I succeeded then I would know that God had given up on me and if I didn't then at least everyone would finally know what I'm dealing with. 

I know it's incredibly foolish to challenge God, but at this point I honestly don't care anymore. "

Iâm such a selfish piece of shit. I donât even have a reason to be depressed. Yea my parents are fucking assholes and I never leave my house so Iâm really lonely, but that isnât a good reason to be depressed. Other people on this sub write stories that will bring me to tears because I just feel so bad for them and I truly hope it gets better for them but I just have no reason to feel this way and itâs a huge inconvenience. I fucking hate feeling depressed because then I feel selfish then I get angry and then I cut myself as a punishment."

"Job slavery increases thoughts of suicideI donât see a point for working for a living at some dead end job that I wonât enjoy doing for my whole life. My life projection consists of staying at my dads place until heâs passed away then it will probably be a matter of time until Iâm homeless unless my sister gets a job. I just feel like a burden at this point amounting for nothing. 

I got in contact with disability employment services to find work just to keep my dad happy. So Iâll just ride it out with this employment crap while my dad is alive then after that just die from starvation out in a secluded area in my town. And Iâm surprisingly comforted with this thought that one day this rat race will be over."

Double period music is actually the most chromosome sufficient idea I can think of, i would honestly rather sit through a triple period with my English teacher, who smells if horse shit. But I guess I have much more serious problems to be thinking about, such as my formal education, amongst others."

"""Why do you want to kill yourself?"" - someone asked me that last weekI was going to write this when I was a bit drunk but I need to get it off my chest now I suppose. So yeah someone, I won't elaborate on who, asked me this question. And all I could think was ""is it that obvious?""

I crave social interaction but the fact is i genuinely don't like other people. They're too happy or too cringy for me to tolerate. I don't get people my own age and it's not like anyone else would get it. I'm fine most of the time by myself but those moments where you just want a friend to actually like you hit hard.

I've never had a relationship go longer than 3 months and my last real relationship ended when she cheated on me with my best friend(well former best friend, I won't ever speak to that rat ever again). 

I want to know what it's like to have someone like you. To find you attractive, but I hate the person I see. But that's the sad part isn't it? It dosent matter if you're dumb or smart or if you're ugly or pretty, it's all the same when you're dead. 

And I won't go to a therapist, there's nothing I hate more than the idea of paying some quack to dig about in my head for a solution that doesn't solve the overarching problem. The only comfort I have is alcohol and I will keep it close to me till the end.

I'm tired now. I guess I have been for quite some time. "
"I feel like I'm getting worse every day (long post)...Three months ago, I was a normal college student and now I'm a broken shell of who I once was. I was doing fine until I started having trouble in my English class which wasn't good since I was an English major. Eventually my grade got so bad that it brought everything else out of my head and one night at 12:30 AM, I walked from my dorm room to the nearest ER and checked myself in because I was suicidal. From there, I spent the next six days in a local mental hospital and after a brief release, went back for another 3 before staying out ever sense.

After my release and bipolar diagnosis, I dropped out of school and began wading through a series of appointments, medication changes, an impulsive moment where I ran away from home on a greyhound bus and meetings with social groups because of my autism diagnosis from back in school. All that has happened is that my sense of purpose has been eliminated, and any hope of going back to my previous life is gone.

My life has changed so much that I'll never completely recover. Since I dropped out of college and my bad grade was in the same subject I was majoring in, then clearly I'm not meant to be a college graduate. Because of my lack of a degree, the only chance I have of any life above the poverty line is if I can get into my state's vocational rehabilitation program. Even that won't get me too far. The involuntary hospitalization will stay on my record forever and I'll always have these issues to deal with.

The point I'm trying to make is that any hope of a normal life is fading fast and at best I'll be a menial worker struggling to live over the poverty line while struggling with my internal problems. At worst, I'll end up as a shut-in/welfare leech like Christian Weston Chandler where my entire existence is to fail at everything I try and make an ass of myself while doing it. I'm even starting to look like him since my medicine slows my metabolism and I gained 10 pounds in a month. I'm not suicidal yet but offing myself seems like a superior alternative.

EDIT: I misjudged the length. Sorry about that because I don't know how to fix it."
Hello reddit I don't like Keanu Reeves or the John Wick movies
"Get yourself a friend who can point out all your flaws and still be a friend Obviously donât get into a toxic relationship with someone. If youâre being abused in any way, contact help and leave the abuser as soon as you can.

I mean make sure you have a friend who is close enough to point out mistakes and help you learn and grow as a person.

Example: Yesterday I said something unknowingly offensive to some friends. This morning one of them confronted me. Harshly. I made someone upset due to my ignorance and social awkwardness/inability to explain myself (which I shouldnât blame but it did play a part in it). Thankfully we are all still friends and Iâve promised to learn from my mistakes.

When someone points out your mistakes, accept their criticism and try to learn from it. Itâs natural to act defensive but showing someone you care and that you want to be a better person to them means a lot and could strengthen the relationship.

I wonât say what offensive thing I said. It was just an awkward comment that I explained very badly."

"Reincarnation sounds amazing. The idea of a restart just by killing myself is too temptingI keep hearing stories that if you die and you get a restart. What I would give to restart my whole life knowing what's going to happen to me.

Even if it isn't true, death would better than my life now. I was bullied for 10 years where I was pushed around and called names and all the effort I put into my studies and club which resulted in average grades and a meaningless certificate. I lied to people that I had good grades before because it hurt admitting that there were nights I stayed up studying weeks before my major exams and it meant nothing.

I finally got out of that shit hole and I wasted my chances. People kept complimenting me and I got arrogant and my short temper got the best of me. My first friend I made in my new school was amazing. She was there whenever I felt down and there for me when people pushed me around. But she couldn't stand my attitude. Everyone kept warning me but only until I lost my friend did I realise what an asshole I am.

"My life has been getting worse by the dayIâve had problems for a long time now, with my health, work and finances, my ex took the kids and now my girlfriend left me today. I loved her a lot, I still love her. My life is garbage right now and Iâm completely alone. Yesterday I told my mother I wanted to die and that I plan to commit suicide. She started to cry and the confusion and surprise of her only son telling her that, and that look on her face has really hurt my heart a lot. I donât know what to do anymore. Today I took my gun out and put it to my head. I couldnât pull the trigger!!!! Fuck me! I canât even do this right! I just kept thinking about my mom and how this would kill her too. She has already lost my sister when she was 3 years old. My mom has never been the same since then. And I know that this would completely destroy and essentially, kill her too. She has done a lot for me in my life and I for her. Every day is getting more and more difficult to live. I donât know what happened to me! I was a happy kid, good grades and a lot of potential. Now Iâm just a miserable loser, and I hate myself for it. Iâm a damaged and broken human being and my existence is pure pain and suffering right now. I donât have anyone anymore! Iâm alone! I stopped talking to all my friends, and all of my family is on a different continent. Thereâs no way out!  I counted on my girl, she was my rock! And now sheâs gone and probably hates me!

"M14...I have a lot of problems and just wanted to get this off my chest.

I fear social interactions. I feel a literal pressure on my bidy, when being around people i dont know well. Its so severe, that i cant speak out loud in school or i cant go out anymore. If i am forced to speak in those situations, i stutter and cant put together proper sentences.

I also havent been happy in over a year and i have no motivation. It started at a young age. I had a girl-friend in 1st and 2nd grade i was really close with. She had cancer and eventually died in 2nd grade. It wasnt much better after that. I was almost bullied to suicide in 3rd grade. 4-6 classmates would come up to me and push me to the ground, hurt me and verbally abuse me.

My mother wasÂ  an alcoholic and tried to kill herself in 2017. She is now sober.
Both of my grandparents on my mothers side died.

I cant open up to anyone. I have 2 ""friends"", but they are never there for me and if they have to choose between me and anybody else they never choose me. One of my friends is my dealer and i get vyvanse( a kind of amphetamine) from him, to cope with my problems. The drug makes me feel happy and when im only happy when i take the drug. Im also addicted to caffeine pills. I take them to get some motivation back. My dealer constantly dumps me and wont give me the drug even tho i already paid him.

I have a horrible body, i have genetic diabetes, my foot are at a wrong angle and i need to be operated and my eyesight is bad.

I tried going to a therapist, but i just could talk. I was in a state of fear. I cant tell anyone about my emotions, except online. I have no one i cant open up about and let it out. I wish i have someones shoulder to cry on.

I was just recently thinking of killing myself again and i was really close to doing it, but i just wanted to live the rest of my summer vacation.

I dont know what to do anymore. I get no more fun or enjoyment out of anything. Its hard for me to get out of bed, because of the lack of motivation.

No one besides my family likes me.
Only my family would come to my family and actually care if i killed myself.

When i lost my grandparents and my friend, I didn't shed a single tear. I wasnt sad. It wasnt shock either because im 14 now and i still feel no sadness when people die. I also have very questionable morals and im currently searching for a painless and quick suicide method. Im not scared of death. Im an atheist and i believe that there is nothing after death."
It's my own fault.I'm going to die because I'm too afraid to ask for help. I'm going to die because my friends are too afraid to offer me help. They could have saved me if they had only asked what was wrong. They never knew how bad the situation was. But I know it's not their fault. It's mine.

"No one wants to deal with sad people, but get angry when they decide to do something about it.Iâve reached out to people before and they just get hurt. They canât handle it because itâs too much or too sad or they donât have the time. Itâs honestly fine. I understand that no one is obligated to listen to me or give me any of their time, but I know these will be the same people who will be upset if Iâm gone. My sadness is so inconvenient that theyâd rather me stay sad and destructive for the rest of my life than have to deal with any of it. There is no fix for my problems and I feel like itâs selfish for them to want me alive when they know just how awful I feel. They donât have to help me, but they shouldnât get mad when I try to help myself.

More context: Iâve also done therapy for 3 years and been on multiple meds for depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I exercise, practice self-care, and try to do my hobbies when I can pull myself out of bed. I have tried everything else to fix myself. I worked really hard just to keep falling to the same low point."
"its so hard to care about things anymorei wish i was at least sad so i could feel like i have something alive inside me. it's so unbearably difficult to act like you care about anything anymore, but i feel like i'm okay with life just passing me by. i feel like i should do more, but i just can't bring myself to even blink an eye to the things that are supposed to matter most. i don't want to die, i just don't want to exist."
"Is it normal that ur last real scary nightmare was when u was like 7? Yeah idk once or twice a year I do still get afraid or jumpy when I fall in a dream and then wake up by it.

Or fight the guy who has been staring at me for long or just escape the situation. But often I dont get close to those situations.

"i relapsed, and i'm scaredover the past few years, i've made strides in therapy and personal growth and learning how to cope with my depression/anxiety. i even worked up the courage to estrange from my narcissistic mother.

i went from thinking about killing myself multiple times a day to thinking of it maybe once a week.. and lately, all of those thoughts have just flooded back in.

because this year is the fucking worst. america is the fucking worst. i was supposed to graduate college, move out of this hellhole state, and experience some ounce of freedom for once in my life. and now i just feel fucking stuck. i don't think i have the motivation or the strength to fight this anymore. i sense my expiration date is nearing soon."

"Part of the reasons Iâm moving out of my house, is because it would be easier for me to kill myself.Each time Iâve tried in my current home, Iâve been found and taken to the hospital. I donât want that. Iâm too weak to stay here."
"If you show me something outdated, donât get mad at me for thinking itâs up to date ffs Today at school I was required to fill out a paper where I would choose my subjects for the year. I was required to get 60 points and each subject was worth a designated amount of points. So I chose some and calculated that it would be 60. I brought the paper back and I thought that was it. Until I was approached by a teacher, who said âdonât try to cheat your way out of this. You canât choose under 60 points worth of subjects.â

So then I calculated what the points would be and I got... 60. Then I asked the teacher to calculate it herself. She then told me that arts was only worth two points despite it saying 4 on the paper. She then asked âdidnât your big brother or cousin tell you that thatâs outdated? Nowadays arts is only two points.â

Why tf did the paper still say 4 then?? Anyway I chose swedish as another 2 points and that was that. 

One time I asked if I could go to the bathroom during class, and I did get permission. The second floor bathroom was out of order so the first floor was my only choice. I headed there and on the girlâs bathroom it said âonly for the disabledâ i then got confused because we didnât have any more bathrooms so I headed back to my class and asked the teacher where I could go. 

âDownstairs bathroom, duh.â

âBut it says itâs for disabled people only..â

âNot while the construction is going on upstairs! Didnât your older sibling tell you this?â

She then called me dumb for not knowing that it wasnât actually only for disabled people"
"I really just wanna leave.I wanted to before, but I just lost a seven year relationship for a reason I don't know. She just blocked me out of nowhere.

I guess I kinda know. Between my personal and professional life, I was unable to give her the time she deserved. I hope she found another relationship, one that makes her as happy as she did me. I hope she doesn't see this this, just in case ahe recognizes me and realizes who I am, but just in case I don't wake up tomorrow, O wanted to say I'm sorry, and it wasn't your fault.

And Iâd just like to clarify.

"Already took 8 Excedrin PMs in the last 30 hours.Reddit, I need your help. Every time I get depressed I start taking sleeping pills to the point that I forget how many I've taken and pass out. I just forced myself out of bed for the first time in 18 hours.

I'm just worried I'm going to absentmindedly take too many and end up either dead or in a coma. I mean that 8 is an estimate, it can very well have been more.
I'm not here for attention or advice, I just want someone to talk to, preferably someone who has had experience with sleeping pills.

**UPDATE** Its about 2:30pm EST and I haven't taken any since about 11am,and I put the bottle out of eyesight so that I wasn't tempted to take anymore, I'm still pretty shaky, but I'm finding ways to distract myself, I have art class in a few hours and my boss just gave me the day off tomorrow (which should help I can relax and sleep naturally for a bit). I just want to say thank you to everyone who replied, you all really helped a lot :). I may update again later if things with the bf don't go well, or PM some people who said it was okay. Thanks again you guys :)

**2nd Update** Okay, 8:45 pm, feeling much better emotionally, but really physically ill, dizziness, nausea, loss of direction, unable to make coherent conversation, but other than that fine. Again, thanks everyone for your positive attitudes, it really helped me out, also, I dumped the pills and am going to try to sleep on my own tonight.   (YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME)"

"my parents ignore my depressionI am a 17 year old girl. To sum it up the last 2-3 years of my life has been hell and it has just gotten worse. I lived with my abusive alcoholic mother since I was four in another state. I had enough friends to have a support network so generally it was ok. My mother passed away and my father (someone i never really liked) moved in with me. At the end of the school year, we moved to the DC area, which was planned in advance and something i was aware of and fine with. While we lived there, it was okay, though my health (mental and physical) was declining. During this time, I attempted suicide multiple times. Every time, I was either locked out of the house, threatened, or laughed at by my father. Suddenly my parents (father and step mother) decided to pick up and move AGAIN to another state. I have no friends and due to medical problems am in virtual school. I am extremely depressed because of what happened to my mom, 2 moves, and having no friends. my parents are completely ignorant to this. Every time I try to talk to them, they brush it off and say it's not that bad or somehow my fault. I did not ask for any of this to happen. My parents and I constantly fight. My father throws garbage at me, mocks me, yells at me for eating too much or too little, and throws tantrums. Both of them criticize me for not having a job, but we live in a rural area and neither of them will drive me to the nearest town. Whenever I'm around my family, I feel unwanted and like I am a burden. There are many more things i can go into detail about, but i have tried to keep it short. I would have thought with my past they may have considered being a little more supportive or thoughtful, but when I talk about depression or suicide they ignore me. They refuse to look into therapy. I am just looking for support and maybe an opinion on what I should do. I have looked into emancipation but I have no way of getting a job to support myself. If I tried to go to the authorities, I fear I would have what little of my past life (my pets, my personal items, my online school) taken away from me since most of my relatives are no longer living.  Right now, everything seems hopeless."
why does reddit shit on younger users e.g. 13-14 year olds. i see posts saying âimagjne being 14 or underâ or âyouâre 13 why are you dating so youngâ. in reality itâs maturity that matters more than age itself and age should only be an issue if itâs something illegal. being younger than someone doesnât make you less cool is what iâm trying to say
"I don't think I can ever get help.I'm trans woman and that bothers me so much. I don't think I can ever get help, because there is no help for me. I hate being male, but I'll always be. Forever. And that hurts me so much. I hear people say ""trans people are delusional!"" But the truth is, I wish I was delusional, I wish I truly believed I'm a woman, and I do think I *should* be, but sadly I'm not. 

I don't think transitioning will help. I can't change my biological sex. The fact that I will probably always look like a male doesn't help. I feel like if I came out, people would call me a female name and pronouns, but only out of kindness, not because they believe I'm a female, not that I blame them. I don't believe I'm a female either, and that really hurts me. 

I really hate the negative perception of trans people aswell. It really gets to me that people will either think that I'm a delusional mental ill man, or a autogynephile. I might be mental ill, but I'm not a autogynephile. I'm not a very sexual person. I never masturbate, or have sexual fantasies, yet these people will think I'm a pervert. I don't know why I'm trying to prove that I'm not a autogynephile, they'll never believe it. 

 I really just hate being trans. After 2 years of trying to accept it, I can't. But sadly I can't accept being a male either. I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense. It just really gets to me. I don't know how I can get better if the only cure doesn't work for me. Some people might be okay with it, and I'm glad it works for you, but sadly it doesn't for me. 

Rant over, now go ahead and call me names. I understand that I'm the weirdo that's easy to bully. Goodbye."
"Suicidal for the first time in YEARSPlease tell me if this isn't allowed here and I'll remove it.  (Also posted to r / mentalhealth)

&amp;#x200B;

 

So I'm 19 years old, a female, and I just came to college in August 2018. I have struggled with mental illness since I was like 6th-ish grade. I started cutting when I got dumped by my first girlfriend. (I can't move on. It was so long ago but I've never moved on 100%) It wasn't to manipulate her or anything, it was just the only way I knew how to deal with the crushing heartbreak I felt. Things got worse. January of 2015, I took about 15 OTC sleeping pills; they didn't kill me. Things continued to get worse. My mother began to cheat on my father. Thanksgiving weekend 2015, my mother dragged me and my younger sister to her lover's house two hours away. I hated it. When we came back, my father pretty much knew but didn't say anything. Then, my mother, had me lie about our Christmas plans. With the threat of the impending nuclear meltdown that was my family, I took two bottles of OTC sleeping pills and waited to die. My parents found me but were going to leave me. My sister begged them to take me to the emergency room. I was hospitalized overnight in the emergency room before being sent to the loony bin for a week. I got out Christmas Eve, though my mother still dragged me down to her woman's house. I fought the urge to kill myself there, and started to actively try to get better

I got on some medicine and it was helping a little bit, but I moved states (for college) and I haven't been able to see a new psychiatrist so I've been out of meds for a couple months. I'm also terrified of going to the new doctor because I want to lose weight before I go. I don't want to be introduced to my psychiatrist as a fatty. I can tell already that I'm severely depressed, which I'm so fucking familiar with that I can handle it.

Two things are worrying me though. First off, for the first time since I'm starting to see things. I keep thinking I see/hear things that I know aren't there. I'm seeing people and not just shadows, but fully formed nightmare things. In class, in the window, in the shower. I'm always on edge, wondering when the next thing is gonna show up. And I swear I'm hearing animal noises and grunts and stuff.

Second of all, tonight I actually said out loud, for the first time since 2015, that I wanted to kill myself. I honestly don't think I ever got over passively wanting to die but I haven't thought or said that I actively wanted to make an attempt on my life since I was 16. And I just said it. I don't mean it, or at least I think I don't mean it right now.

Basically, I'm just at a loss right now. I'm terrified to go to the doctor and be branded as a fat ass (2014/2015ish I struggled with anorexia) but I also know that there's a possibility of severe relapse if I don't take care of this.

I'm just so scared and empty. I don't know what to do."

"Iâm extremely conflictedI am suicidal, and though have never attempted it i still have dreams where i nearly die by my own hands. I am suicidal for a multitude of reasons, I want to grow up and live a happy life as a nurse helping people, but because of Covid-19 i am unable to catch up with my schoolwork to be able to do well. I find finding motivation to do it hard and i seem to have extreme mood-swings that either make me too carefree to do the work or too stressed to do any work.

I also believe i have gender dysphoria and im 99% sure i have it, but because of covid-19 i am unable to get the help i want. I also hate my body, i hate my broad shoulders, and my awkwardly long arms and legs in comparison to my torso, im extremely skinny and i donât feel pretty. I want to look like an elegant woman, but instead i look like The Rake or slender man.

i have a bit of a strange relationship with my parents, they claim they love me but i feel like they resent me, i feel an extreme disconnect with them as if they arenât my parents and they donât support me.

the only reason i probably havenât tried to kill myself is because i donât want my sister or friends to be sad since i love them all dearly and i donât want them to suffer like i have."

"So my first period was CANCELED! My first period is AP Biology. Like most people, I kind of hate this class. So you must have felt my dismay when I woke up this morning and saw that it was time to start.       

But Alas! I receive a text from my group chat saying that my first period is canceled! The kids at school were having a substitute teacher! The teacher didn't know how to use Zoom, so we were off the hook!
          
Overjoyed, I returned back to my bed an catch up on some much needed sleep. I took note of how much time I had left until my 2nd period. All was good.       
         
Then I slept through my second period."

"I feel bad for being yet another one in need of help, in this sub, but yes, I'm contemplating suicide.Hello. I don't know how to begin... I've been extremely lonely for the past 9 months. Each day I feel worse and have no one to talk to about this. I had a (somewhat) reasonable life, which I tried to change for the better and failed. I ended up unemployed (the least of my troubles, hated being fucking exploited), with no significant other and with no friends. My closest company was my girlfriend. We were together for 6 years and lived together for about 4 of them. She was my girlfriend, my friend, my everything. I feel ashamed because this is almost a clichÃ© by now (hey fucking girlfriends, man!), but yeah. I'm not saying that is the main reason for my mental state at the moment, but it is a very big part of it, in that, she was the one I talked about all my other problems. While life wasn't perfect by any means, I had her to talk to. Now I miss her trust more than anything, it's like I lost my closest family member. We went through so much together and we know each other better than anyone else, at the moment at least. She blocked every kind of communication medium with me. It's like she killed me inside her. I just don't know where to turn to now. I'm really confused, even as I write this. It's like this is the pinnacle of a number of issues that had been dragging for some years - there is so much I've been through that is contributing to my current state of mind that I honestly don't know what to talk about. I'm in a breaking point of loneliness, regret and guilt.

Sorry for my awkward english. Hugs."

"Donât mind me just ranting about some stuff. Not safe for the easily offended left winger. Ok. Iâll start this off by saying that I in no way am a racist. Not. At. All. I believe that EVERY life matters, born or unborn. And Iâll say it upfront Iâm pretty much your average republican. Pro life pro gun pro police the works. So if that offends you then move on to the next post cause youâre in for a doozy. My parents raised me to be a free thinker. And Iâve done just that. I have taken fact and logic and formed opinions. Therefore, my views can be swayed using ONLY facts and logic. On to the point. 
I just saw a post saying that blue lives donât matter because a blue life isnt a thing but a black life is. Saying that a blue life is a career choice but you canât choose to be black. And yes. Black lives matter. But so do white ones. So do Asian ones. Korean. Mexican. Spanish. Name the nationality, their life matters. But hereâs what ticks me off. 
People take one bad experience and crucify the lot of the group for it. One shooting and suddenly all guns are bad. Yes. Shooting are awful and should never happen but the only thing stopping a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. So thereâs that. 
And I really hate the hate I see being thrown at our nations cops. And Iâm not saying that all cops are saints. Or that racism doesnât exist anymore. Iâm saying that we donât need change to the system as much as people say we do. Iâm saying that the ones calling door CHANGE, donât want CHANGE. They want CONTROL. The same thing happened to the military way back when. People were hating and spitting on soldiers coming home from hellholes in Korea and Vietnam. Itâs nothing new. But it sickens me. I hate it. âJust turn off your computer you right wing racistâ no you have the right to disagree with me. But the moment somebody tries to take my rights because another abused them, we will have a problem. 
Guys please understand that I donât know everything and I know that. But facts and logic have basically gone out the window when it comes to the left, and if youâre TRULY open minded youâd see that. So all I ask is if youâre going to crucify me, use facts and logic from your own research not CNN articles.

"I feel alone in a bad wayHi guys, Iâm here because I really have no one who will listen to me. I need some support, maybe someone has a similar experience?? Growing up I was never allowed to have emotions, Iâd get punished for crying emotionally  or being hurt physically. Now I have a partner who also punishes me for being hurt about anything. It doesnât even have to be about something specific to him or the relationship, just any sign of emotion from me and heâs had it. It really makes me feel more suicidal than before. Completely alone. He tells me Iâm too sensitive and I need to stop crying over things. I save how I feel for when heâs not around because of comments like that. It confuses me how Iâm âtoo emotionalâ for him when a lot of the time I hide my emotions (I started to hide my feelings only after trying multiple times to be open and honest with him ab them). It makes me want to die. I have never threatened to kill myself for the sake of attention or manipulation. I told him I needed to know I matter to someone and the response was âIâm not expressing to you that I want you here, because I shouldnt have to.â I donât have anyone. I feel really alone and I donât want to hurt anymore like this. Iâve had two panic attacks tonight- Iâm exhausted and want out."
"I have called the suicide hotline and used crisis chat a few timesI am looking for a solution, not comfort. The hotline and chat have both only been able to provide comfort, which was useless for me because I have only used logic to justify suicide.


Every time I reach out is a desperate attempt to find someone else that has stumbled down a similar path towards making a real positive change in the world. One person doesn't stand a chance, nearly everything stacks up against them to make even a local change. I don't know what I could possibly say to find that kind of person anymore. I am exhausted. 

All I can see that I can do now is to serve an example to not let your dreams be dreams. I will build my plane and fly it, or die trying.

Fuck. Everything is dripping with greed. Spending my life trying to sort out alternatives and lifestyles that benefit everyone and make sense... just to have people look at me like a fucking nut. Apparently not wanting to take advantage of people is an alien concept to this world. I can't find words for the disgust it brings me.


I believe I am beyond help. I'm mostly just putting this here for myself so that I can say I tried. I don't expect a change.


It's scary stuff. I can't talk about this sort of thing because I am terrified that if who I am speaking with actually understands it, they will fall into the same conclusion I am currently at. I'm going to try not to think about it now. Not much use though, seeing as it has been on my mind every day for years. I am so tired."

I have absolutely no one in my life that I can even talk to, and there is probably only a few people that could prevent me from killing myself, one of those being the woman most similar to me.

I cant stand the lonliness.

I truly like my ex girlfriends more than my father.

I am 100% aware my best romantic match exists, so does the pornstar most similar to me, and evangelical/megachurch Christian woman most compatible to me exists.Â

"I hate my real life32 year old loser. Lives with mother. Pushes shopping carts for a living. Can't drive. No qualifications. No motivation or ambition. No skills or interests.

Used my grandads inheritance money to go to Japan for a month. Met a girl in Japan and lied about my life to date her because I was sick of being lonely. Had a great time with her and was actually happy for once in my life. 

Came back hone to England and sunk back into severe depression pushing me to the brink of suicide. Reached out for help from mother and she doesn't care. She doesn't speak. Just wants me to stay in my dead end job because we live under her boyfriends roof and I'll be made homeless if I quit.

Thinking about handing in my notice and just going back to Japan for Christmas anyway. It might be just for a few weeks because that will be the last of the money. I'll be homeless after I leave my job, but what is the point? I am constantly depressed as fuck anyway. Maybe I should live a few weeks more of a fantasy in Japan and then just end my life. "

"I am so broken. I don't think I can take this for much longer.*I am not a native English speaker, but I really need to vent a little bit and the idea that no one I know will read this, makes me feel safe.*

I don't know when it started but I always felt different, not in a cool way, but in a horrible ""i don't belong to my own skin"" way.
I am 25 now and honestly I don't know how I made it. If you ask me what did I did for the last 10 years I would point 5 ou 7 things and then theres nothing, either because my memory is deteriorating slowly or either because I didn't live much experiences.
I am gay. My family is very conservative, not because they are the traditional alt right family, but mostly because they are rural workers who got a really hard life when they were kids, so I don't think I can blame them. We all are fucked up in some ways.
I hide myself for so long I can't socialize anymore. 
I went through some really tough shit back to elementary school, I got scars I don't think will ever heal.
I am been treated for 3 years and I am still falling apart.
I am really, really lonely. And it fucks me up because I do wanted to live, but not like this. I feel fine for 5 or if I am lucky maybe 15 days, and then I am broken again. It comes from nothing, its just like it isn't me if I am not sad, and I don't want to be remembered like that. Someone who couldn't be happy.
In fact, I wish I would never be remembered, I want to vanish from this world.
I've read someone saying they once got asked ""for how long do you want to be dead?"" and this question made them realise they didn't want to really die, but I do. My answer would be: Forever.
I wish I could travel back in time and take care of my mentally health when I was a teen. I would probably be in a better situation right now. 
The only thing that made me give a step back today, was the fact that my mom is really ill, she can barely walk and it would be fucked up to let her with such a trauma.

But at this point I am pretty sure I won't make till my 30s. Definitely. I am a goner."

Its torture to see myself go down but I don't have anything to live for anymore.

"Taking shit in schools bathroom, why is it had such bad stigma? For the past week, I had use the school bathroom for ""Heavy duty"" twice.

I only got stomachache if I eat something in the morning (Banh Mi with a-lot of hot sauce and ya'll know what hot sauce do.) and I getting comments from a classmate and he called me a 'shitter' and I said:  
\-Well, you tried to not take a crap for a years.

"I don't want to do anything except dieI've never made a post in reddit before, all I do is lurk and you guys have made me laugh like crazy and always cheer me up, so I figured reddit seems like the place to post this shit if I'm going to post it. So I'm a noob so sorry if I fucked up something and wasn't suppose to post here or something.

I just graduated highschool. I don't want to go to college, I don't want to do anything in life.

All I've done all my life is act. That's it. Just pretend to be someone else and somewhere else because I hate being me. Every second. Every day. I'm living an illusion. So that's basically the only thing I like to do. And I know being an actor is like impossible and I read more about it and I don't even think I want to do that. But the point is that there's nothing I want to do. I'm as unmotivated as I could be. What's the point? Right now I'm taking a year off and crying my eyes out each night wondering what the fuck I'm going to do. It's a nightmare. I am absolutely terrified. At one point I even had a knife to my neck. I know I wouldn't do it though because I'm a pussy. That's the only reason I'm alive. That and I have a family who I would never dream of doing that to. I just often find myself hoping that a fucking car will come out of nowhere and kill or something like that. It gives me about as much pleasure as someone daydreaming about winning the lottery or something.

So yeah. I don't want to do anything except die. And really, I haven't done anything. I haven't ever got drunk, high, gone to parties, or had a boyfriend. Probably because I have no friends because I'm trapped inside my own fucking head pretending to be someone/somewhere else. So I've lost the will to live when I haven't even lived yet. Thanks for reading this. Please reply even if it's to say ""man the fuck up"" or something (even though I think ""tough love"" is against the rules) so I don't feel so fucking alone right now.

"I donât know what to doIâve fucked up many times in my life and just recently was probably my worst. I feel like my life is going nowhere. Iâm in college and Iâm on my way to failing out. I canât focus on anything and I accidentally fuck over people I hold dear. The only way I feel like I can dig myself out is by finding something Iâm passionate about like music but donât know the first thing about it. Iâve wanted to kill myself many times and I feel like Iâm dangerously close this time. I really donât know what to do I want to die so badly but Iâm too much of a pussy to follow through with anything or try anything too painful. I feel like I fail everyone around me.

"Tired of living. In process of saying goodbye to everybody I care about. Suicide should follow soon after.28 years old, mental health problems, depression, anxiety, neurosis. Never had job because I canât handle it. Never had a girlfriend because Iâm ugly and emotionally retarded. Virgin. 

I canât enjoy anything any more, sleep is the only respite I have so I sleep a lot. The anti depressant pills donât have much effect, just make me feel more numb. 

Over the last couple weeks Iâve been visiting the few various people I care about and who care about me just so I can say goodbye in my own way. I also plan on writing an extensive suicide note so they know it isnât their fault and they shouldnât feel guilty. Iâm ending things because Iâm broken. 

I just hope they move on quickly. I canât live like this any more. Thus isnât how human beings are meant to live."

"Iâm so scared to die I might jump IMMEDIATELYDear internet,

If any of you are harbouring such feelings, I do hope youâre able to find some sort of help in your life. Well for me, itâs simply breathing. Donât know if that works for you too. I really do understand such feelings and I often experience these feelings....they come and go in waves that make me recall the terrible challenges or feelings I have to go through. Itâs a daily occurrence (almost).

I donât know why I am feeling this way: so very helpless, often empty at heart, and above all, the very intense feelings of wanting to end it all. 

Iâve heard that itâs often the people who go through the terrible trials that understands such feelings the most. Maybe I can explain it.

The feeling of wanting to end yourself is a terribly heavy feelingâI feel a wash of relief but Iâm often ridden by guilt at the very back of my throat. Thereâs this feeling of temporal existence...not sure why Iâm trapped in this bubble that is life. Often, feeling like a burden to everyone I cross paths with or worse still, feeling  the need to cover up any intention of death because you donât want to frighten your loved ones.

But you think youâre never loved, do you? I often feel this way too. And so do many I guess. Donât feel this way, donât feel that way.....stop. Donât tell me what to feel. Iâm afraid it would be true that no one loves me.

I donât know and I want to die, always. I still do wish the very best for everyone on here. Life is tough. Life is bloody terrible. I always dream of jumping off or enduring the painful knife that stabs me through and ceases my existence. Life sucks. It gets progressively harder. You try your best and for what? To meet your maker? (If youâre religious) or what...? Have a shot at love and all the wonderfully warm experiences people enjoy eg. Stepping into a warm place after a cold day? Thatâs all? Sounds like life is an endless cycle of pain and relief.

I cannot fathom why choose life when itâs hard to foresee the road ahead. Thereâs so much pressure. You always have to spar with someone or something and push yourself beyond where youâre at currently...nothing to discourage...just gets very pressurising sometimes. 

I do feel a little lost in this thread. I sincerely wish the very best for everyone but I must be honest: I cannot hide such feelings. Iâm trying to find a ground between what I struggle with and telling people that they do matter. You do, itâs just that I donât feel like I do. 


Iâm 19 and I often hear how âyoungâ when so and so dies...all that nonsense about wasted potential because I do empathise with such a choice. A final choice in fact. Iâm here to rant about what I really feel but Iâm also here to tell people not to end it....it may help knowing that a lot of us struggle in life. I believe all of us do.

No one will probably read this. Itâs okay. Maybe if youâre a lurker Out there and just read this, hi! Nice to meet you. I just want to feel okay and survive such intense suicidal feelings....as much as I also tell people not to give up living. Itâs so complicated."
"I really don't know what else to do.My entire family hates me and tells me I'm selfish. My mom is kicking me out of the house in a month if I don't find a job. 

I tried to help by doing my part the best I can but everyday is a constant battle with them because often they are unhappy with what I do. 

I don't believe in god and I can't tell my family, a common issue, and it isn't the worst thing. But it still hurts I can't be open about who I am.

My dad works several hours a day and my mom stays at home doing hardly anything all day. It has been like that for a long time. She used to be a hoarder which had a big impact on my childhood...not being able to have a safe, clean home to live in really sucked, Especially since whenever I tried to clean she would yell at me for throwing away, ""perfectly good"" items (moldy shirts and what not).

My brothers and Sister don't get angry at our mom. They don't see that our childhood should have been much safer and our mom should have been more responsible. I feel as though they are manipulated by her or afraid of her.

I still don't have my GED and I am almost 19. My parents home-schooled us but just kind of stopped caring after a while.

When I was sixteen I would cut myself and I asked my parents if I could get therapy or counseling for it. My mother told me no because, ""If an employer sees you had therapy they won't hire you.""

My cousin was in an abusive relationship and I told her everyday that she deserved better. She would tell me off and say how she was in love with her abusive boyfriend and that I didn't understand. She is out of that relationship now and I am happy for her, But it still hurts that she never thanked me or her other two good friends for staying by her side, when a lot of her friends abandoned her.

I really have no idea what their or my mental state is but there is something wrong with either them, me, or all of us. There is something wrong and I don't know how to fix it. 

I don't want to be the problem child anymore but I also don't want to give in to my moms whim and play along as if it's ok to live in filth and chaos. I have no Idea what to do anymore because I have no access to any kind of professional counseling for me or my family.  

I do have one last small glimmer of hope. My boyfriend wants me to find a job in the next town over and move in with him. If I did my situation would be a lot better. However it would be really difficult to do this as I have five dollars to my name and no car, no phone, no job, and no education.

If I killed myself now, I won't have to worry about my family problems or finding a job or achieving my dreams or anything. I will be asleep. At rest. I won't have to worry anymore. I just want to shut off. I want to stop, to be stopped. Anything.

"I accidently caused that, by a year older girl has a crush on me. I need help, and who better could help me than bunch of deppresed teenage strangers.

So I (m14) was on Pioneer camp like every year, and we, like always, had dancing ""party"" at the end. I am part of this group, that is same age as me, boys and girls mixed. Mostly are here always partly normal songs and partly slow songs, where we dance in pairs. I danced with one girl from that group, which is mostly introvert and doesn't often talk with us as a group. But you could say we are friends so when she wanted me to dance with her, i was absolutely alright with it. Then i danced with her practically till the end of the party. Through the evening, i started thinking about what if we'll be together, like for the first time ever, cause tbh, everyone, including me, mostly shiped her with my best friend. She is smart, she is pretty, yeah kinda hot too and she mostly has the same hobbys and personality, as me. But I am still other than her. She doesn't enjoy just being with friends, which Is for me the best way to be happy. She isn't romantic type. I am. My thoughts ended undecided. At the end of last song, she kissed me on cheek. I was really surprised, but i think my previous thoughts prevented me from doing something thoughtless. I think i made a discordant face. She apologiesed and than the party ended, so we all went to bed. Next day we were cleaning up and preparing for outgoing from camp. She send me this letter by some kid. The letter was like this:

I'm sorry for what happened yesterday. I promise i won't do it again, so please don't be mad at me.

I then found her and told her I'm not mad at her, i just didn't expect it. I know i should've said more, but i didn't feel like it. When we were leaving, we hugged for goodbye.

I have contact to her and i don't know if i should start dating with her. I just can't decide. That's why I'm here."

Future.I cannot see into the future. I cannot see a life with me in it. When I think about the future and what it holds for me I just see hey black space. I really can't see what my future holds for me. it seems that no matter how much I think I've changed from the person I used to be I will never change enough and I will always be the person I hate so much. I just want someone to crash into me or for me to get hit by a stray bullet because when or if that happens I will not fight to stay here. I'll just let myself go.
"I think there is something wrong with me... So for the last few weeks I feel really tried and I struggle to get out of bed everyday. I stopped attending my online classes and just gave up on most of them. I haven't spoken to any of my friends in a month and I have completely stopped talking to my parents as well, despite living in the same house.

I have no idea about what's wrong with me and I might have only felt this way once or twice before. 

I feel like I am going through a major slump and I should just give up and sleep for eternity. 

Sometimes I wish I could cry, but it doesn't come out, ever. Sometimes I inflict physical pain so that I can start crying. I just want to feel something again. I want to feel happy, I want to laugh but I can't. I dont know why but I feel like I dont deserve to be happy. 

I want to be able to work again, just do something and be someone. I want to go out and breathe fresh air but something inside of me stops me from going out. Ever time I get ready to go out I feel like I might not come back home alive. 

I stare at the wall for hours together not thinking about anything. I feel like I should be reaching out for help or something but there's no one close to me who I could bother with my troubles.

I also have become very impulsive for some reason. Just the other, I woke up randomly at 3am and climbed my wardrobe and jumped from the top of it and broke a tile. I get jitters and I run around the house for 30mins non stop or just learn a new ice skating program just to replicate it in my room.

I wish I could be happy again...."

"Today was the closest I've ever come to doing itThis morning I drove out to this mountain near my house to watch the sunrise and wait for my nearest gun shop to open at 9. My plan was to buy a handgun, hopefully something not too expensive, drive to the nearest police station, and shoot myself in the temple in the parking lot. That way at least someone more prepared for it would find me.

I always promised myself that before I did it I would call the suicide hotline just to see what they had to offer. Honestly, it was kinda disappointing, but it still helped a lot to actually talk about my insecurity and fears without just getting some cookie-cutter, fake response. After that, I decided to sleep in my car for a while since I only had 4 hours of sleep last night. 

I'm skipping all of my classes today which sucks, but it's better than killing myself I guess. I can't afford to call off work so I still have to take a shower and all that stuff.

First, I decided that too late and was having some difficulty maneuvering into the parking space. Then I figured I was close enough and hit the brake. Only it wasnât the brake; it was the gas pedal. The car immediately sped over the low curb in front of me and I heard something metal scrape the pavement behind me. My dad and I both panicked. I somehow managed to park in a different spot. I started laughing. My dad told me to take it seriously. I said I was taking it seriously. 

We got out to check the car. Thankfully, no obvious damage was done to the back and nobody was hit because nobody was in the parking lot. My dad drove us home. Now I know why he didnât like the idea of me driving. 

TL;DR Driving practice with Dad. While trying to park, I hit the gas and ran over a curb. Nobody was hurt."
"I am trapped...Hey there,

I dont know if you are familiar where you want to do something with your life but the universe works against me. 

I dont mind doing what I already do but since yesterday something changed and now I feel trapped in doing something.

It is not as if doing that something is bad for me but because I have the feeling that I cannot leave it just makes things worse and more specifically makes me nervous and full of worries. "

"I feel as though I was born by some sort of freak accident. I do not deserve to live.I'm just going to express my deepest thoughts and be completely transparent. I hope this may be an eulogy, who knows.  

I look back on my life and feel the same similar feeling of uncomfortable, wrong belonging. I don't deserve to be here on this beautiful earth surrounded by kind, good humans. Spending many a hour with my thoughts, I find the conclusion the same every time - I must have been a freak accident, a mistake. 

I feel as though I've been sent small signs from the universe that, no matter how hard I try to ignore the fact I'm sad, keep coming at full force. It is a hint or a push to die? 

I'm 25 and I've been abused most of my life by myself and others. Again, please don't think I'm looking for sympathy. I have long accepted the fact I'm 'wrong' and deserve death. I've had a glass bottle smashed into my skull, sexually attacked by multiple men at the same time, thrown into a large fire and my hand broken. As for self-abuse my left arm is deformed from multiple stitches and staples. I think the only way this could have all happened in sequence is if the universe is telling me to go. It knows I need to die and is pushing that thought because it is deserved. 

I'm not a good person. I have to repeat this to myself in my head hourly so that I know my worth and place (unfortunately, the mind does wonder). It's quite humorous the way I pace around my flat talking aloud to myself like a robot. I have to talk to myself. Tell myself I'm awful. It's like I'm doing lines. It helps my head not to explode metaphorically. It's kind of like, 'You're not meant to be here, you're too cruel for this world, you deserve to drop dead' etc. 

I turned to prescription pills. I got myself slowly addicted to codeine. Im more of a 'fade out' person, I want to fade out like a candle rather than go out with a bang. I think that thought is mainly so my family don't have to deal with the fact the ugly ginger in the family killed herself. I most definitely don't want to bring anymore shame to my respectful and successful family. 

I guess now I'm at the point where I'm either going to overdose 'accidentally...' or disappear into the woods and let Mother Nature run it's course. Please know that these aren't the words of a troubled, sad mind but those of someone who genuinely doesn't deserve a life. I know that most suicidal (or sad) people are the most open and beautiful souls. That is not the case here. I sometimes wish I could donate my whole life to someone who actually wants to live. I think about that often. 

I hope not to wake tomorrow. I really do wish this evening to be my last. The world will be a much better place tomorrow, when I'm gone."

"I can't trust myself and I'm conflicted.2 weeks ago I went up to the woods with a revolver a bottle of vodka and bullets and played Russian roulette a couple times then contemplated just doing it. I was there for 5 hours just thinking and feeling the gun and holding it to my head.

In the end my exact thought was ""As much as I want to do this I can't hurt the people I love"" and I walked out and told a close family member what I had done. 

I went to a crisis counselor two days after my attempt and she wanted to admit me to a psych ward but my parents knew that would just make me worse as well as me so we left and they sent the cops to my house which eventually just left after I talked to them.

Now I'm making new plans and this time if I attempt I will definitely go through with it. My aunt took the gun but I have other methods like a cyanide pill or jumping in front of a 16 wheeler on the freeway. Everyone already knows I attempted suicide but even if I tell them I have these plans it won't help at all because I'll just be admitted get out and be in the same place I am now and if I don't get admitted talking about it to a family member won't do anything.

I see myself going down the same road of suicide each and everyday with no escape. Im not hopeless I just see no point in living anymore and am currently living for other people. My therapist asked me what it would take for me to live for myself and that was probably one of the hardest questions I have ever been asked.

Thanks for reading this far, every single day is a battle hanging on a thread of trying not to kill myself so I don't hurt my family."

My teachers gave up on me, along with my parents. My father is verbally abusive and probably bi-polar. He bullies me verbally as much as any kid at school. My mom is amazing, but she's always working. My only friends are Alex and Cailin. Cailin goes to a different school, and alex goes to mine. Alex is just like me, and we think the same way, and we're both pretty fucked up. Cailin is the most amazing girl in the world. She talks to a fucked up person like me, even though she's pretty and popular. I love her. But, she's not enough to keep me from killing myself. I'm addicted to ADHD pills and alcohol. I've smoked weed, nutmeg, and salvia. I hate myself for doing all those things. I'm a failing artist/guitarist and all my work just plain fucking sucks. I'm not smart enough to have a good career, and im too lazy and worthless to change. I'm overweight from an eating disorder known as being hungry and tired all the time.

"I'm trapped and there's genuinely only one way to get outI'm not very good about speaking what's on my mind. Especially not in person and I'm awful at just speaking and being a functioning human in society. I've never been a part of society like the majority. I've never made friends very easily and the few I do make I can't keep bc idk how to be a good friend. As much as I try my mind always finds a way to tell me toxic little things. Like how much they hate me, how they think I'm fat and ugly, how they think I'm too weird or maybe even slow in the head. Maybe I am a little slow or maybe I'm just bad at being what everyone else expects me to be. I'm not saying anyone wants me to be perfect but I can't even meet the basic standards. Maybe it's bc I'm unmedicated and have a string of mental illnesses plotting to ruin my life. I am bi polar but people can get through that and learn how to live with it. So idk why I can't. I have severe anxiety and social situations seem almost impossible to handle correctly. But most people learn how to cope and just get by or at least try. 

Anyway I wont get into everything that is ""wrong with me"" but I know there is something truly wrong with my head regardless what anyone tells me. Everytime someone tells me it'll get better or anything along the lines of trying to help me, all I can think about is how fake they are or even if they are truly genuine if they understood everything I feel and everything I've been through maybe they would see that ending it is what's best for me. Ending it is the true mercy that I hope I'll find sooner rather than later. I have my reasons and I won't explain them all bc I don't believe I have to explain myself at all to anyone. When it comes down to it what I do with my body and my life is my choice. No one should be able to take that away from me. I've been hospitalized and I've tried to end it before. I obviously didn't put my full will into it bc here I am. I told myself I would never go back to being in a mental ward ever again. It's either go through with it and make sure nothing can go wrong or stay and keep living and stop being so fragile and ""selfish"" or ""pathetic"". I don't think my family or anyone else thinks I could ever actually do it. They might be surprised one day. I think about the sweet closure of death everyday. It's become normal to me and I can feel how far away I am from everyone else. It feel like I'm galaxies away from every single person and I'll never reach them no matter how hard I try or how hard I want to. 

Ik probably no one will even read this. I'm sorry. If reading any of this triggered anyone or upset any body but I had to get this pressure off my chest. There's so much I want to say but Im not capable. This is as close as it gets. I don't need anyones  support or half assed reasons to stay alive or ""it'll get better"", ""it won't last forever"". Maybe I'll chooe to end it some day. Maybe I'll choose to stay who knows. All I know is ik just waiting for something to push me far enough to the point where there is no option left but to just fade away like everyone before me. The only thing I want is for people to treat me the exact same way they do when I die. I know that's impossible and I know most of the people I've ever known will milk my death and talk about how we were so close or how much they cared about me when it's the people who claim to care about me the most that have helped pushed me to the edge. When we die no one knows what happens. At least I don't know what happens. I hope it's just the end. No more dread, pain, regret, sadness, dissasociation, no more anything at all.

"First relationship ended I'm 15 and I'm an introvert who's moved 3 times and can't talk to people at all. Corona happened and I was stuck at home doing nothing. I started playing Minecraft on a server playing bedwars. Met this person who I played with for 2 weeks when I leave to go eat, I come back to find they found more people to play with and wanted me to meet them. The people were 2 girls, (one was 18 and one was 16). I met them both and we got to know each other. I joined a discord server who my ex owned (16 year old) and got into a voice chat. We agreed to pull and all nighter because we could and we wanted to. And in that night people on her server joined the voice chat and they started to talk about birthdays. Then she says ""if anyone can guess my birthday, I'll share a lewd photo of me"" That was supposed to be a red flag but my hormones got the best of me and didn't realize it. I found out that she lives in Chicago and I live in Cali.



Fast forward some time and I start to mention how beautiful she looks and we start to flirt and tells me how nice it would be to meet and kiss, cuddle and cute stuff like that. I really liked her at this point and I didn't want to mention her as a friend so I didn't mess anything up with her in the process. 


Some days later we're all playing like normal and then she just leaves out of the blue. I didn't think much and the 18 year old says not to worry she's just upset. Later on instagram she sends me ""I'm not coming back, It's just not working out"" I'm confused and hurt that she left. She unfriends me on discord too. I reply with that I'm confused on why she left and if she leaves that's on her, can't stop her, I let her know she's hurting more than she knows.

"My story. This is a long post.This is my story. 

I don't know how you will respond to this. I hope it will be a positive response. 

But about five years ago, my mom and dad got a divorce. My mother decided the perfect time to tell me was on my 30th birthday. Little did I know that would also be the day that my depression started. I felt just so incredibly broken. 

My family means a lot to me. I also had a strong faith at the time. I'm not so sure anymore if I do or not. 

I remember I prayed for my family every single night and day. But, it didn't stop them from breaking apart. 

My father use to be a deacon at the church we all went to. So, we were a respected family in the church. 

Then he left. And we stopped going. 

My mother since she told me about the divorce has been going back to church. But, I think she is doing it for the wrong reasons. She over heard some other lady talk about my father and his girlfriend going to the church that she goes to. So, mother decided that it was time for her to go back. And she kinda went in a little too deeply. Before she goes to church she watches the preacher Steve Gaines on TV. 

And here is the really funny thing. She will give me a call and go on and on about how both preachers had a great service and message. I will ask her what they were about, and she can't even tell me what they are about. 

I did go to church with her the first day she went back. But just to watch her and see what she was going to do. And, I certainly got a show. I knew exactly why she wanted to go back. It wasn't because she had an interest in going. She just wanted to find people to talk to about the divorce. And she did. She made sure to draw enough attention to herself to cause people to come and talk to her. It embarassed me. 

I mean, sure, I was upset that my family was torn apart. I still am. 

But even before all of this, there was trouble in the family. 

I've had a strained relationship with my mother ever since I was ten. I was never good enough for her. 

She would look at the TV and see the models on them and then look at me and she would growl at me. She would ask me why I couldn't look like that. Or why could I be smart. I couldn't.  And I can't be. Because I have a neurological disability. I'll never be the genius level smart that she wanted me to be. And I'll never be pretty. 

She calls me fat, ugly, and useless. 

She has gone so far as to say to total strangers that I was a mistake. 

And there are a lot of times that I feel like I am one. And this has been going on since I was ten. I'm 35 now. And I have hated every single day of my life since then. I want to die. 

I'm not married and I don't have a boyfriend. 

I can't even hold a boyfriend for long enough. They meet my mother and shortly after they break up with me. They say that don't want to be in a family with a person like her. 

She wants me to move back home with her, since I'm in danger of loosing my job. I have been trying to find another job, but I am just not getting anything. 

I'm being mentally and emotionally abused by my own family. 

And in turn it has caused me to abuse myself, if that is even possible. 

I do not have a great self image of myself. How can I love myself when I haven't had anyone show me what love is. 

I have zero self confidence or esteem. 

I just exist. And I wish I didn't. "
"I've never tried to make more of myself, only lessI keep my stuff to a minimum. I try to have as little effect on the world as possible. I push away friends and deliberately alienate new people I meet. I live my life like a ghost. I once spent nearly a month using only the words 'hello' 'goodbye' 'yes' 'no' 'sure' and 'thanks' and nobody noticed anything weird about that. 

For a while I physically tried to make less of myself. I was bulimic for six years and no one knew until I'd been in recovery for two. 

I do everything I can to reduce the impact of my existence in an effort to reduce the impact of my inevitable non-existence. I might as well already be dead. Nothing would change. 

I only have two reasons I haven't yet. One, no one would look after my pet. Two, I don't want to traumatize whoever will find my body. I've been playing with the idea of a time delayed text message so that EMS can whisk it away without anyone having to see.

"Glad I made itHey guys. Wanted to share this, incase it helps anyone. 

In November of 2015, I attempted suicide. It didn't work. Not even close. I thought it would, and I was totally prepared to die. When it didn't, I felt a mixture of disappointment and relief. 

Cut to: last October 2016. I was better, definitely better, but no where near close to being healed. I was depressed most weeks, and I often thought about suicide. This lasted up until around the beginning of January. Until then, I was still healing, and still trying to just get through life. 

Cut to: March 2017. I'd been feeling so much better. I was enjoying life, and for the first time in ages, I was enjoying getting out and going to class, and even seeing people. That's why I didn't see that Tuesday coming. Out of no where, the feelings hit me, and it was as if they'd never left. I was on campus, looking at everyone around me, feeling completely alone and completely done. I was determined to try again, only this time I wouldn't mess up.  
Only this time, my boyfriend saved me. He talked me through it, helped me through the night, and by the next morning I was on my way to feeling better again. You know how these things go. 

Finally, cut to: the end of March. I decided to begin applying for jobs (I graduate college in May.) I applied, and got denied, to many many places. I was beginning to get distraught, and I felt hopeless. At this point, I didn't know why I was alive. It felt like I had nothing going for me, and I was doomed to be worthless. (This process for me technically started in January, but I focused a lot on it in March.)
A week later a saw a job posting for a position that looked like it would fit me. Not thinking anything of it, or expecting a reply, I sent in my application. The next day I got an interview. That same day I was hired. 

Since then, it's only April. Today is April 22nd, 2017, and I am so thankful I was never successful in ending my life. This job that I thought nothing of, has changed my life. It is the job of my dreams. Each day I walk in to work so excited, and so so incredibly happy. After my first day, the first thing I thought to myself was ""thank god I lived."" 

Things CAN change. Things CAN turn around. I'm not saying I still don't struggle, or that I won't ever struggle again. Hell most nights are still hard, haha. But because I made it through, I got to experience this incredible opportunity to work for my dream company, doing what I LOVE to do. It only took 2 days for things to get dramatically better. 2 days. It's unfortunate I suffered for so long, and that most people have to, but I just wanted to tell someone my story in case anyone else feels trapped in how their life is going. I think I'll always struggle, but at least now I'm happy most days. 

If anyone needs someone to talk to, I'm here ð"
I don't think any of us actually wanna stop living but just wanna go back to a time where we didn't wanna die..Being in such a fragile state for so long can lead us to believe some things our conscious know isn't true..
"Girlfriend wants to kill herself, urgent, please helpHello, I am 18 and live in Denmark, my girlfriend in 17 and live in South Africa.

She has very religious parents and yesterday they found out about us and I didn't hear from her until this morning in a string of messages saying she tried to kill herself yesterday and that she  wants it all to end.

She has previously been beat up by her parents, but this time it has been to the extend of her bleeding from her mouth and unable to see.

I can't even imagine living without her and I want to help her more than anything, but how do I fix this situation.

What are the options when she is still legally a minor? If she was 18 I could get her out of the country via an au pair solution. 

What the fuck do I do? I feel drained for ressources. I just want to save her but how the fuck do I do so? Do I file a police report? If that would even help though. Obviously the coporal punishment law is being abused to the limit, but I don't think it can make it stop...

I am probably looking for an answer there doesn't exist, but does anyone have any idea what I can do to fix all of this, please?

**UPDATE:** She ended up in the hospital yesterday, because she took too many pills in an attempt to kill herself. Luckily it failed and she had a realization, she didn't want to die. She is alive and 'okay', she won't be allowed a phone to talk to me for a month-ish, but knowing she is okay is all the relief I could ask for. I feel so grateful, and I would like to thank the people giving it thought and tried to help, it gave me hope, so thank you.

"I canât think of any reasons to keep on livingShort version, I feel pretty worthless, I know I come from a more advantaged background than others and that other people would gladly use the resources I have. I just donât see the worth of me keeping on living. If there is a heaven, then great, I get to go there and be done with life. If not, and I go to hell, what difference does it make, I was gonna end up there anyway. And if there is nothing, and Iâm just a sack of meat thatâs temporarily alive, it really doesnât matter anyway. Right now my friend just texted me asking if I want to hang out. I enjoy spending time with my friends, I love my family like anyone else. But I keep sinking again and again. I keep getting into these thoughts and moods.

"Casually Suicidal.Not sure if this is the right place to post this, not really knowing what to expect, just needed to express myself. Every time I have a bit of free time, or the smallest thing bothers me, I daydream and ponder just killing myself, think about how and when. It just seems to come out of nowhere and it's not even massively distressing anymore, it's just there. I don't know if that means I need help or not. Maybe someone else feels this way. "
"I'm at that place again...I feel a little hesitant about posting this, as I don't want to take attention away from someone that has an urgent issue. I guess I'm not urgent, but one of the scariest things to me is not knowing when it could actually happen. I've never been completely resigned to killing myself, but I'm sure some others aren't either when they commit the act. 

I just turned 20 and was hospitalized around a month ago for a bout of severe depression and suicidal ideation. I began talking to a therapist and was put on medication. I quit taking the medication because of not being able to deal with the side affects. I also haven't been showing up to appointments with therapists. I have just continued to choose to neglect myself. I was told I had depression or dysthymia. 

I can see my life getting better, I really can, but I'm just so unsure of how to get it there. I don't really understand how most people's advice can help me. Sure, I can start exercising and finding new hobbies but I'm sure something will always come along and fuck things up again. I consider myself pretty weak, and I'm ashamed of it. I have all the empathy and thoughtfulness in the world for others but it always seems to be unrequited or taken advantage of. I'm young, but I feel like I haven't been able to learn lessons from the mistakes I've made. It always seems to happen again, and it's always a cyclical issue that ends with me being at this same place. I can't even say I'm ""tired"" of it. I've been living for the struggle of finding something to make me snap out of this, and I don't know how to make it happen. I guess I'm just jaded.

I got dealt a pretty decent hand of cards. I come from a supportive family, I'm not ugly, I'm reasonably intelligent, and I got a full ride to a good college. Maybe I'm unappreciative or ignorant, but these things haven't been a perfect recipe for happiness. I'm tired of people telling me I have no reason to be sad. This may sound pretentious, but I don't really feel like I was ever meant for this life. I can barely keep it together without feeling like a fool most of the time. I've completely failed at school this semester as well due to depression. 

I don't want to die, but some nights like tonight, it's hard for me to see around that. I threw away all the alcohol in my house because I knew if I started drinking there was a much greater chance of me doing it, and that scares me. It's so hard to ask for help, but I know I need it. I need to get out of this hole, but it just seems so hard. "

"how much chores is too much? first of all please bare with any mistakes I make. 

I am 17 female and live with my parents and my siblings (14f and 9m). Until last year I had to clear the table and wash the dishes every night after dinner, it wasn't so great but I can do that since it's not much. 

Now that I turned 17 my parents decided that I have too many privileges (going out, sleeping at my boyfriend's, seeing friends) so they gave me more chores to do. Now I have to wash the dishes, clear the table, do the laundry, hang the laundry, put away the laundry and make dinner once a week, everything related to the laundry is on Tuesdays and weekends (Tuesday bedsheets and weekends clothes). I personally think that it's too much since I also have to take care of my brother on the Wednesday afternoons, have to help him with his homework and have my homework done everyday. I'm having a mental breakdown because I already know it's too much when school only starts tomorrow! I don't know when I'll have time to see my boyfriend and friends with all this and I feel really sad and mad about it.

am I overreacting? is it normal to have that many chores?"
"Want to die more than anythingI'm useless, always will be, and all I want is to have love and earn it, and I can never earn it because I'm useless, I don't work at all, I don't do anything.

Nobody else benefits from me, I'm a horrible person, anybody who thinks they love me is lying themselves, they have no reason to uphold me.

I'm trying to go through methods, but I don't think there's anything guaranteed. Self-preservation instincts mean drowning and stabbing are off the table. My toaster's cord is too short, and we don't have anything to jam the tub with anyway. I don't know if we have a gun...

I just want to die, help me kill myself, please."
I want to kill myself one of these days but Iâm too much of a bitch to.Iâm almost in college. Itâs my senior year. I have no idea what I want to do and I still have to take the ACT. Iâm not smart enough for a job that pays well. Iâd probably be stuck in the minimum wage world for the rest of my life. Itâs not hard to get a gun in my state so by the time I hit 25 Iâm ending my shitty life. I cut myself but it doesnât satisfy my thirst for pain. I want something new in my life and cutting doesnât give me a rush anymore. It used to make me feel cold but I feel nothing anymore. If I continue to live I will become homeless.

"Sort of rambly but I feel like I need to talk/vent (trigger warning)I've had depression and anorexia since middle school, and I'm 20 now. My psychiatrist and therapist recently (within the last year at least) diagnosed me with schizoaffective disorder, which is basically schizophrenia + depression. I feel like everyday it's just so difficult for me to even get out of bed and go to classes, and about 75% of the time, it doesn't work. I can't leave my apartment. I haven't left my apartment for the last 2 days, and though I haven't felt suicidal in a while, I can't think of the last time I felt genuinely happy and all I can think of is how hopeless everything is and that I'll always be like this, depressed and hearing voices and seeing things and not being able to go out and have fun. My doctor told me when I was hospitalized that suicide is something that people consider when they run out of coping mechanisms or when their coping mechanisms aren't sufficient for the problems they are facing, and it seems to me that I've run out of methods to deal with my problems. The only thing that I can think of that is stopping me from shooting myself in the mouth or overdosing is the thought of my parents and how sad they would be. I keep thinking that once my parents grow old and pass away, I'll be able to kill myself and not have to worry about people being too distressed. I don't know what to do anymore, and I don't see my therapist and psychiatrist until the end of this month/early next month (respectively)."

"Feeling out of place with people who surround me(family, coworkers, peers). Canât make an emotional connection with anybody which is probably why Iâve been single for my entire life.Iâm 27 years old, and have always felt like an outsider. I was the shy/weird kid who hung out in the background in high school who never hung out with any particular group. I manage to get through life by smiling all the time and being super passive. But along the way I internalize my true feelings: anger, sadness etc. I hate who I am and I hate that I canât connect with anybody. My communication skills are shit and I know if I had a way with words I would be much further along in life. Iâve recently noticed that I stutter when i get flustered, with the position I hold at work I canât afford to come off as a dumbass but I feel like I fail miserably at it everyday. Anytime any guy has shown interest in me it always fades as soon as i reciprocate feelings which in turn has given a nosedive to my self worth and self esteem. I feel if I were to end it tomorrow nobody would notice or care. The only reason my family would notice is because I make a decent wage and their âpiggy bankâ (i.e. ME) would be gone. "
"How do you care about something when you know it's ultimately pointless?I've accepted that suicide is inevitable. Life is miserable and I've tried everything to make it better. It will only get worse as I get older. I've done years of therapy and medication and programs. Life remains miserable, painful, and pointless. 

Right now I take care of my mom, who has a lot of health problems. I'm all she has. There's no one else to take care of her and we can't afford for her to be in a nursing home. She doesn't deserve to suffer the loss of child or have to be neglected. 

Basically, I'm waiting for her to die so I can kill myself. I don't know when that will be. For the time being, I have to be alive. 

I'm working on assignments for incomplete college classes. I'm finding it extremely difficult to work on or finish anything. I know that the work is pointless. I know it won't mean anything or improve my life in any way to do it. I have no desire to do it. And I'm pretty hopeless about even passing these classes even if I do the work. I've already had two professors change their mind about accepting it. I'm trying to get them to reconsider, but hopeless about that as well. If they don't accept it, I don't finish school. Financially we're totally fucked, so there's not an option to retake the classes. 

I don't have a desire to finish. I don't aspire to anything. I'm just waiting to die. Rationally, I know it would be better to finish the classes, so I could qualify for some better job opportunities. I feel like I can't find any incentive, no matter what I tell myself or what scenarios I imagine, nothing encourages or motivates or inspires me to the work. 

I'm going to be miserable no matter what I do, so why bother? I gave up on life a long time ago. I can't get myself to want anything other than death. It's why I couldn't finish these classes in the first place. 

Before I die, I do think I'd like to finish this. The trouble I've had with school has caused me a lot of pain. It's definitely a significant factor in my decision to commit suicide and feelings of hopelessness. 

That's not the right thing either though. I still don't care. "

"Iâd never thought Iâd make this post.I donât even know where to begin. Iâve read posts on reddit so that I could find people I could sympathize with, but Iâve never made an account until now. I guess you could say this is rock bottom for me. I feel so incredibly alone and I donât even know what to do about it. 

To start, I have pretty severe SA, and Iâve always assumed that it would fade away and get better when I got older. Iâm 20 now, and the realization has finally set in that I donât think Iâm going to be able to overcome this. Even as I type this itâs becoming more and more real to me. I am in college and I hear my friends laughing and talking outside in the common room of our suite and I just donât have anything to say. I can never laugh and talk, even with my friends, because I feel like I donât even have an opinion. About anything. I sit there with them saying the occasional few words and laughing but I genuinely donât have anything of value to add to the conversation. 

On top of this, I have become increasingly depressed over the past few months. I am studying actuarial science right now and am about to take my first exam next week on probability but I donât think Iâm going to pass it, and I donât think thereâs anything in this world that I could do to make money and be happy at the same time. 

It just kind of hit me one day that this world is such a meaningless place, and that Iâm probably not ever going to be happy. All of the meaningful relationships I once had from HS are fading away and whenever I do see my old friends we donât make new memories, we just talk about our ever fading old memories that will soon be gone one day. 

I donât even know where Iâm going with this, and canât even begin to put how Iâm feeling into words. I have no motivation. If I sit around and do nothing I feel anxious and useless and when I get spurts of motivation and start to get stuff done I quickly become tired out and exhausted and I feel like itâs all useless anyway. I have no one to talk to about this either, I could never bring up the nerve to talk to my family about it and Iâm honestly so socially anxious I couldnât even bring myself to see a therapist. The only time I am myself is when I am home with my brothers and now that I donât live there anymore even those conversations are starting to become stale. They have absolutely no idea whatâs going on in my head. 

I just donât know how I am going to make lasting relationships with anybody if I canât find meaning in my life and value my own opinions and interests so low. If I canât even find things to say in conversations with my own friends how am I ever going to meet new people, or talk to girls nonetheless. I just feel so helpless and useless and that thereâs nothing that I can do about it. I try to look up online ways to be able to hold conversations, but I feel like whenever a conversation comes up I donât have anything to add. I donât really follow sports or music and I honestly donât even know what I enjoy, so how am I supposed to get along with anybody? I feel like I have to study music or Netflix shows or sports statistics to even be able to hold a decent conversation, and I donât even know what I would SAY to a girl.. everything in my life is so negative I honestly donât know what I could talk about. 

Iâm sorry this dragged on so long, I just needed to get these muddled thoughts off of my chest, no one will probably even read this but Iâll put it out there anyways. Iâm so socially anxious even posting this is hard for me... Hope you all are doing well in your own lives. "

"Deal for a life timeAnyone else make deals with themselves? I don't know if this is just me. 

Some background: I've never have kissed anyone, been on any kind of date, or experienced any love from people who weren't family. I guess this makes mean insel or how ever you spell it. 

I've felt alone for such a long time that o couldn't handle it and I started to genuinely figure out how I would finally end it. One of my friends found out and talked me down. It's still just as bad as before but now all I can think about was how sad everyone would be if I was gone. I also recognized that my lack of romantic connection was particularly my fault. 

So I made a deal with myself that if o don't have a successful date my the time I'm 25 I'll get to off myself. On the condition I actually have to try. So I'm actively on dateing sites and doing my best to make good first impressions.  

So has anyone else done this or am I just crazy?"

"I have no future because I'm a dumbassWhat the fuck am I doing with my life? Absolutely nothing. I tried going to college, but I'm just too fucking stupid. I don't get very good grades even when I try because I'm just not smart enough. I went to the disability service office at my school and they said I should go in for an orientation after they asked me a bunch of questions and stuff, but I never went. And that was so long ago. 

What can I do? My future looks pathetic. I have NO job skills whatsoever. I'm 20 years old and I've never had a job! I'm horrible at talking to people, I'm too damn shy and I'm stupid. No one would hire me. And even if they did, I would get fired after the first week. I don't even know what career I want. I took this class in college that was supposed to help you with finding a career, but all the teacher said was to take this test online to find out your ""perfect/ideal career."" I took the test, and it said I should be an art director or a fashion designer. Both don't sound good to me. It's not like I can ""try out"" a career and if I don't like it, I can just quit. And I don't want to be like my 47 year old mother who works at taco bell.

I don't know what to do. I'm too dumb for college. I'm not good enough for a job. And I have a horrible personality. Even on reddit people think I'm dumb. Even after going to the disability office at my college, I still don't think I have a genuine disability because being 20 years old, you would think doctors/teachers would have seen it already? I know I'm just dumb. Dumb and stupid, can't put it any more simpler. 

So, what? Should I give up because obviously my mind is still in the ""teenage"" stage and I'm not cut out to be an adult? Or should I just live my life being an unsuccessful fucking loser?"

"Lost my cousin yesterday to suicide. Have some questions about the difference between ideation and intent.I lost my cousin to suicide yesterday. I wasn't aware that he had been having any issues that might lead to this, but I guess I wasn't close enough to really know. I cared for him a lot though. He was a good guy, especially towards me. 

That having been said, I've had a lot of suicidal ideation throughout my entire life. Like, as far back as I can remember. At one point, a few months ago, I had been seeing a therapist at my college's Behavioral Medicine center (which was free), but once I graduated in December, that ended, so I haven't been on any antidepressants since then. I've only ever gone on them for those maybe 3 months, but they were a massive help. To be honest, I didn't think I needed them as badly since the stress of school was gone, and I didn't have the giant issues of living with my family like when I was a kid. 

Any way, the point is, that therapist had asked me if I had any plans to actually kill myself. I told her no, which was mostly true. But her asking me that, of course, prompted me to think ""If I were to do it, specifically how would I?"" I had dumb plans when I was a kid about jumping out a window that I was too afraid to go through with, and now I know how I'd do it if I were to.
I want to know if that crosses the line past suicidal ideation into intent. Like, I don't have any plans to go through with it at any time, I just know how I'd do it if I was ever driven to that point.

tl:dr: is having an idea of how you would kill yourself if you ever got to that point intent, or still in the range of ideation?"
So my gf wants to take our relationship to the next level But Iâm personally not ready to go to that next level do u have any advice on how to tell her that

Just another miserable asshole M/22I know I'm not unique I know I'm not special. I'm A 22 year-old Virgin. I kissed a girl once and actually got the third-base on her it was pretty cool. That was three years ago though and I don't see it happening again. I was too scared to leave the house today.both my roommates left for the weekend. I haven't been to the gym in months. Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror and I think I'm handsome guy. Last year I thought I was gay for a little bit but I think that's because I was just so lonely. I start talking to a guy on grinder but then when he asked to meet I got nervous and deleted the app. Sometimes I look at gay porn but not very often. I don't think my roommates would understand. My sister tried to kill her self a couple months ago. She's turning 27 next month. She lives with my mom and quit her job right after she tried to kill her self. She just got a job at Walmart two weeks ago and recently quit. My mom has to go with her to her doctors appointments. I haven't seen my dad in three years. I should call him more often. I have talk to him one time since Christmas and it did not talk to him on Christmas. I dropped out of high school and have very bad handwriting. I'm really self-conscious about it. When I was 18 years old I weighed almost 400 poundsmy mom bought me a treadmill and I ran on it every day. I stopped writing this note to order a pizza there's something funny about that. It's not a matter if I'm going to kill myself but when. My mom and sister are extremely overweight and one of them as suicidal tendencies. I'll probably do it after they die. I see three possibilities for my life. 1. I meet a girl (or guy) who'll sleep with me have a couple of kids be broke for the rest of my life kids grow to resent me I've become an alcoholic.this is the least likely and happiest choice. 2. I Stay employed to the job I don't like get an apartment by myself and basically do what I'm doing tonight for the rest of my life: become a shut in who doesn't talk to people in orders delivery food with social Security money. 3. Kill myself.
"I feel like I have no future to live forWhile I know there's a lot of people who have lives much worse than mine,  I've been so depressed for most of my life for so many things I feel like I have nothing to live for as my 30th birthday is next month and while I'm not planning on hurting myself, there's days like today where I wish I fall asleep and never wake up. I really don't know of a quick way to explain why I feel the way I do without having to explain my life story.  Is the right forum to explain everything or should I try the depression forum?

"I am going to hang myself tonight. I refuse to live in pain any longer.Hey guys. I am a 22 year old female. I just turned 22 on the 17th. I would be graduating with a bachelor's degree in English literature, hoping to becoming a teacher someday. I have a family who loves me. I have friends. I do alright in school, I am there for people who need support. 

But what does any of that matter if I hate myself? I absolutely cannot stand to be in this body anymore. I have been struggling with depression anxiety, and I am almost sure, BPD (yea yeah, self diagnosis, but all the symptoms are there, I would basically have to pop into a shrink's office for a diagnosis). I struggle with disordered eating and have 'recovered' when I was in high school; I also struggle with purging, body image and self-worth. 

I was sexually assaulted 2 years ago in a dorm. It has since haunted me every waking day that I am alive. I have received counselling for it and while the ladies were kind and helpful, it still haunts me. 

In addition to all that fun, I am a sex worker because I don't make enough money to support myself. It's alright most of the time, but it has taken it's toll. I feel worthless. My body is repulsive, it's garbage. I want to peel my skin off and die, I am so desperate, and nobody know how desperate I am to die

The pain I feel comes and goes in waves, so for example, I was having a fucking FANTASTIC stretch; showering wasn't a chore, I was doing sort of okay with food and purging, everything was cool. But when it rains, it fucking pours, and each time I fall back into my depression it gets worse and worse and worse... 

I refuse to live the rest of my life going down this path of hell. I am literally taking my life into my own hands. The only thing I am scared of is waking up and having brain damage. Then I really would have fucked up... You know that saying where people don't really want to die, they just want the pain to end? I really want to die. I don't want to live a life pain-free, I just don't want to ""do"" life. I could call a hotline, but what do I say? Those hotlines are there for the people that want to live. I am beyond help. I wish I had a better method. I don't have any hope left; my heart is aching, it is being ripped in two, I don't know what to do anymore... I figure at least I won't be so isolated even if my last words are read on reddit. I just don't want to be in pain anymore, and I am scared; I know it' silly, but I just want someone to hold my hand and let it happen so I know I won't be dying completely alone. 

Sorry for the rant. I love all of you silly people. Keep fighting the good fight man. "
"I think my friend in England killed herself but I don't know for sure.  Can anyone on here help confirm or deny?  Her first and middle names are Hayley Lelia.Her Tumblr is http://-suicidaltendencies.tumblr.com/.

On the 18th she posted that she was going to kill herself and she sent me a message saying good bye.  She is a very close friend of mine and we talked often but we only talked within Tumblr so I don't have any other way to contact her.  All I know is that she is 18, she lives in England, and she is the equivalent of a senior in high school.

She and I had a promise to each other that if we ever were over the edge we would message the other and wait for a response before going through with it.  She didn't wait and now I think she is gone.

If anyone knows her and/or knows a way to get in touch with her, please ask her to check her Tumblr and/or get in touch with me.  Please let her know that David is worried about her."

"sorryI feel awful about the way I come about suicide. I tell it all to a person who is the only person I have but I feel bad about the way I talk, I donât want to hurt him but itâs nice to talk. I donât want him to think itâs his fault and I donât want him to think Iâm saying it for attention or anything. Talking about it for attention is the scariest thing that someone could think about about me. I mean it when I say Iâm dying inside and I mean it when I say I think about nothing but death and how peaceful it could be to be done with such bullshit of a world. What I donât understand is why suicide is such an awful thing to people, everyone dies eventually so why not let someone be done with hurting everyday? It feels selfish to make someone keep living because u believe the world is somewhat good. It really isnât and nice people always get hurt and Iâm too kind to be cruel. I want to get better and pickup hobbies if anyone has suggestions, I want to give everything a try before I end the hurt so at least everyone knows I didnât give up on them, because everyone gave up on me."

"I've become a demon.Read my previous posts for details.

So I've found yet another bit of hope in what seemed like another dead end to my future. I managed to finish a 75hr online course in just a week and a half and actually got a good mark (77%!). The reason I had so little time was because I started it back in June and the deadline was today. But I still managed to do it and I'm proud of myself. So I just need to take 2 more courses then I can get into uni. This time I don't have to rush through it so I might even get higher marks.

But then all of it comes crashing down after I come back from the movies with my friends, not even 2 hours after I hear about my mark. My mom, who you may have already read has gone insane, showed some serious signs of distrust. I came to my room, late at night, to see my bag emptied out with the contents spread on my bed. I didn't have my online course book in it, but I did leave a folded sheet that had ""academic upgrading"" in it, which was on the bed unfolded when I got back.

This whole time she seemed like she trusted me but now she's catching on. I even think I might've crucially slipped up at one point. This just goes to show that I've created an insane beast of distrust. Even though I thought I escaped this insanity when I saw my grade for all the hard work I put into this week and a half, that insane beast of distrust (my mom) just dragged me right back into it.

I can't tell her the truth. She won't believe a thing I say. I wouldn't even believe me either if I were her. So all I can do is keep lying. But soon lying won't help. And when that time comes, I've resolved myself into becoming a demon.

I'm going to threaten her with my own life. I'm going to tell her that it was her that drove me to do this. I'm going to tell her that if she doesn't just shut up and trust me, and ignore me if she can't stand the sight of me, I'll be forced to kill myself.

I'm so close. I feel like I'm so close to redeeming myself. But my mom just keeps adding stress to me. This stress is killing me. 

I bet those of you reading this probably think I deserve to die. I do, I agree with you. But I'm so close that I don't want to give up yet. 

I don't know if it's appropriate to be writing this here. I feel like I can definitely kill myself because I deserve it. But I also don't want to die. I have two conflicting urges in my head. One telling me to do anything to survive, and the other telling me I don't deserve to live. It's just so messed up. My whole life is just messed up."
"i have no reason to be this depressedthere is virtually nothing wrong with my life, at least not enough to be this depressed about. iâve definitely been through some rough shit in my life but in the last 6 months or so things have been relatively good. iâve been taking zoloft for depression and OCD for years now. took prozac and wellbutrin xl before that. all the sudden this summer my zoloft stopped working. i became massively depressed â sleeping all the time, no interest in anything, crying periodically. we changed my dose and i got a lot better. now things are bad again and have been for a month at least. i constantly think about killing myself, how i do not want to be here going through the mundane over and over until something inevitably bad happens some day. how every good and happy and exciting moment is fleeting. and how i am so disappointed in myself, my personality, my body, everything about myself â and wanting to die makes me feel even more guilt and shame, like i know people have it worse off than me, which only makes it worse. 

i have been putting dying off for weeks. the holidays, work, things that i knew i needed to do. but i know that i can do it any time, and i have enough pills to do it, and they are constantly taunting me from my medicine cabinet. i feel like simultaneously a coward and a burden, like i will destroy the people around me if i go through with suicide and like i will make their lives worse if i stay. 

i donât know why iâm posting here. i canât really share the extent of my feelings with anyone close to me i guess, despite how good they are to me. i donât deserve it. they deserve better."
"I canât live like this anymore I feel awful, I almost always feel awful. I have diagnosed body dysmorphia (BDD) and itâs breaking me down and slowly killing me. Iâm trying to hold on so much but I just canât anymore, I hate everything about myself and Iâve done everything I can to stop the feelings from coming through but they are overwhelming. On top of this, my mother doesnât help the situation. She knows about my body dysmorphia but she doesnât understand how to make it better. I think sheâs trying but she just doesnât get it. Whenever Iâm feeling particularly down about myself and it shows, she gets extremely annoyed with me. Eventually if I donât suck it up sheâll get really angry and half shout at me. She calls me selfish and narcissistic for obsessing about how I look but itâs out of my control. I need help but she wonât get me it. The worst part is Iâm starting to believe what she says, which is what pushes me to my breaking point. Adding ânarcissistâ to the list of things I hate about myself worsens my self confidence even further. Iâm scared things are going to get even worse, I donât want to make a habit of self-harm but when I went upstairs to my room today I was so frustrated I dug my nails into my neck and now Iâm bleeding. I barely regret doing it."
"Is Adventure Bay an adult care center? SO I have a theory.
It started with a question: WHY do these grown adults constantly call a ten year old (who lives alone with a bunch of dogs) to solve their every problem?
BECAUSE Ryder is not a ten year old boy at all. He is a young orderly at an adult care center for differently abled adults with a team of THERAPY dogs and all the episodes of the show are the imagined adventures of one of the patients.
Chickaleta? A stuffed chicken the ""Mayor"" Goodway uses to excuse all of the things she messes up.
Alex? A duck. Mr. Porters grandson died and it drive him over the edge so now he imagines this duck is his grandson and talks to it.
Humdinger? Also a patient, but in the criminal ward so he escapes constantly to try and mess with the other residents. As the only resident in that part of the ward he has given himself the title of mayor. Cares for all the stray cats around the town as the dogs don't like him.
Alternative theory on Humdinger- he's from a similar facility for the criminally insane across the road and constantly escapes to come mess with his cousin Mayor Goodway. (Grandpa Grover is clearly a Humdinger ancestor....)
Katie? ALSO an orderly / employee of the center who helps care for the various animals.
Jake? A former pro who has a severe traumatic brain injury and needs round the clock care - also why he eventually gets his OWN therapy dog, Everest.
Captain Turbot? A sea captain who lost his crew in a storm. Wally was his best mate on the crew and wally is an imagined creature on the campus. Saying Wally isn't real will cause Captn Turbot to throw you in the water.

"Giving upIâm broken.

Iâm giving up in trying to help myself. Nothing Iâve tried has worked. My life will be full of relapses and fuck ups.

I cut a few days ago. 

I stole yesterday. Iâm a kleptomaniac. No Iâm not proud of it, I just see something and I have the urge to steal it. Itâs almost an unstoppable urge.

I want to stop eating again. I tried to go a full day without it yesterday, but it was too hard. Even when I try to fail I suck at that.

I donât have a therapist. The last one I had said that I made up stories about my parents not caring about me.

"I went out with her! This girl asked me out and I said yes! We went to steak n' shake and it went pretty smoothly. Were actually dating now and I think it made my life just a little better. Thanks for the advice, guys!"
"I hate this so muchIdk.   I took a throwaway even thought I've posted here before because I always have a filter.  I'm trying to stop it.  But I constantly sound pathetic without it.  I'm transgender mtf, so that makes life that much more horribile. 

I feel so worthless.  I'm not pretty.  I probably never will be. I thought I was smart, then I fell apart in college and tried to kill myself and as a result ended up dropping out.  So I'm a stupid ugly college dropout screwup, I work a minimum wage job, I struggle not to self harm and I spend my nights in tears until I finally fall asleep. 

I've abandoned any semblance of my old religion, now I pray 'to whoever may be listening, good or bad, god or satan or Buddha, or Bokonon, or Tempus Spatium or whoever'.  Every night.  I only ever want one thing.  I swear I'll do anything.  I'll sacrifice everything.  I just want to be a girl, why the fuck is that so bad. 

Then there's the loneliness.  I'm so screwed up.  I'm a trans girl, lesbian.  And I've done stupid stupid things because I couldn't stand being alone.  Put myself in terrible situations and screwed my life up even more.  I guess I'm more of a girly girl, in that I really want to have a fairytale love.  I don't care about sex.  In fact, from my experience sex is terrible, frustrating, and terrifying.  But I do want to be held, and kissed and loved.  I want to love somebody back, and be with them forever.  Its naive.  

Even besides everything else life seems so pointless.  I go to work for 40 hours a week so I can be unable to afford a place on my own, and live with my dad and stepmom who hate me being here, and I'm paying off massive medical bills from my attempt, and student loans from the semester I failed completely.  

I hate the rat race idea.  I don't want to spend 90% of my time at a shitty job so I can turn around and hand off 90% of my money to random places for basic needs like a house or water or food.  I can't afford new clothes, so I've got the same Tshirts and jeans from junior high school.  Every month new things come up.  

Oh, your car fell apart again, oh you need to do emissions testing, time to renew your licence and registration, and also don't forget gas prices went up, and your job cut your hours, and your heater is falling apart and you need to change the AC filters, and the wiring in your house is faulty, by the way, and in the end I'm just sitting at my desk thinking, oh its ok, if I don't have money for food I won't eat and thats good because I'll lose weight.  

Oh boy and then I end up not eating for days until I about fall apart at work which gets me in trouble.  and I can afford food.  I just hate it.  

At this point I really don't know why I even exist, why I even try.  

I'm nobody, I'm nothing, I'm broken and nobody will miss me.  Even if I live on, complete college, get a job, etc, it doesn't matter.  One day I'll die and then what does it matter.  someday I'll dissapear from the earth completely, I'll be forgotten, and there isn't a god or afterlife because nobody ever answers me.  And if they do exist I hate them.  More than anything in the world I hate them.  

Why the fuck can't I just be happy.  Why is life so shit.  Its not worth it.  This world is horrible and terrible and humans are evil and selfish and god is either dead, or deserves to be.  We kill eachother because we disagree.  We continue to annihilate the world we live in because since we're in charge we can make decisions.  The governments and powerful people only care about themselves, or their immediate family.   

This whole world is stupid and I hate it and I'd rather die than have to deal with it anymore. 

Hey, if religion is right I'll see god, and either I wont want to be a girl anymore or I will be one.  Either way I'll supposedly be happy.  If their wrong I wont be around to regret it, or feel bad about it.  

This is so stupid.  I don't want to be rich or famous, or powerful. I just want to be happy.  Maybe I'm just super spoiled but I'm so damn tired of how much shit I have to do , how much everything costs, and how screwed you are regardless of what you do.  Congrats on finishing college, have fun doing the most menial and pointless version of whatever you studied.  

Fucking hell.  I just want to hide under my bed so everybody will leave me alone, but I can't do that because the ground the bed sits on costs too much, and I'd better pay those debts I 'needed to go into for my future' or ya know, lawsuits, jail, etc.  S'all good.  "
"I don't want to live anymoreI'm a 17 yr old female and I don't think life is worth living anymore. I feel like I've been stripped of my basic humanity. In numb. I'm tired and I just want to kill myself. My depression has progressed so far that I can't even cry any more. I want to so bad and I feel like I'm not even human anymore. I have no friends, no one close to me and my family takes this all as some joke. I want help but no one wants to give it. The girl I loved doesn't love me back anymore. All my family does is fight with eachother and its so loud in my head and in reality. I just don't see the point. I'm done."

"Iâve been in a bad place for years...... The other day my 11-year-old nephew and I was having a conversation. He mentioned to me that I mustâve been so happy on my recent birthday. And I was honest and told him I wasnât. And I also told him that Iâm not usually happy. He asked me when the last time I was happy was, and I couldnât remember at first. After a while I realized It was late April early May 2019. Over a year ago. I was happy for a few hours after I got my test back for some thing I really studied hard for.

In the past four years Iâve probably had only seven or eight days that I felt OK. Not good, but just neutral. And maybe three or four days that I was happy. Almost every day for four years Iâm in a lot of pain emotionally, or physically, And I donât know if other peopleâs experiences are like this with depression.

I exercise regularly. I try to eat right (At least nowadays I do). Drink lots of water. Go outdoors and hike with my dog. I stay connected with family. I talk to friends and hang out with them. I keep a lot of activities and hobbies. I do so much just to feel better all the time. Iâm starting to get very hopeless about ever getting better. 

Is other peoples experience with depression and suicidal thoughts similar? Is it just me or is everything terrible? I never feel good. And I started to tell myself that this is just something I have to accept."

"Why give people benzos if they can't be given long term?Why the fuck was I allowed to feel normal enough to function and then have it taken away. None of the other shit fucking does anything beyond making all of the symptoms they're supposed to treat worse, on top of the side effects. I can't fucking drink properly anymore because my hangovers are infinitely fucking worse, and for what?

Finally a light at the end of the tunnel only to watch it cave in right in front of me. Because it's in my best interest to not take a pill that actually works because it might have harmful side effects and because it can be difficult to stop taking, which sounds almost exactly like the *safe* ones I'm taking now and running out of, except they only make things worse. I think it's purely the idea that I'm aware of the fact that benzos can be enjoyable that I cannot be allowed to have them. 

I don't think it would be too hard to get if I had any friends left or just went looking on the dark net, but it's just like, why fucking bother at this point?"

"I am tiredI'm stuck in a bad marriage with a man that treats me like shit and is emotionally abusive, I'm unhappy and lonely. 

I feel like i have no family as they never make time for me, but always do for my brother.

I am always a second thought to all of my friends, and some even have ghosted me even though I'm mostly happy go lucky.

I'm stuck at home with two young kids everyday, haven't worked because I can't afford childcare and now it's going to take forever to get something that pays enough.

I'm tired of anxiety. I'm tired of all the constant problems popping up. I'm tired of feeling like shit. 

Tonight he told me that no one actually cares about me, only he does and if others do its because I'm not my true self with them. My husband said that to me. All started because I told him his game is much more important than I am these days.

If I didn't have my kids, I'd hang myself. Sick of being beat down by people, mental illness, and pure bad luck. "

"I didnât think I was going to be alive for as long as I am and Iâm not prepared for my futureI practically threw away my life around middle of senior year of high school. Grades falling, losing friends, stress at home was too much, and that was also when I had my first attempt. Thinking about now, Iâm so not ready for the rest of life. Itâs just misery in the future so whatâs the real point of keeping my hopes up? Iâve made a vow to myself that if my life doesnât get better by the end of the year, Iâll end it right before the new decade. So far, it looks like Iâm on that path; itâs only gotten worse. Sorry folks."

This is what this isLife is a fucking joke if you are a man. People don't care about me at all. It's all a charade. I'm left here alone drugging myself to death every day. They literally don't give a shit. Unless they're paid and then they only pretend to care.
My crush said yes!! My crush said that we can be a couple! . Any date tips or something will be nice :D
GoodbyeOn my way to the subway now. I don't know why I am even writing this post.
"my boyfriend is getting his wisdom teeth removed today so i wanted to make a cute post just raving about him and hopes he sees it but i doubt he will :) Well, he's asleep right now cause he hasn't replied to my messages but he deserves the rest, he'll be sleepy all day. 

Anyway...

He's so amazing. I love him so much, our 4 year anniversary is coming up on February 14. I got him his gift and it's currently in transit. I just wanted to say he's literally the most amazing thing to ever happen to me, I wouldn't be the person I am today without him. I... live in an extremely toxic home, and I hate it, I'm not allowed to date but I don't care, I fell in love with someone, and we've been together almost 4 years now. He's so amazing...He's so kind, and charming, and passionate, and loving, and willing, and handsome and cute and literally any positive thing you can think of. He has no flaws. He's so perfect in my eyes. He's been there for me when literally no-one else has.  I couldn't be more thankful. I am so lucky, that everyday I get to call this wonderful human mine, and I get to call him cute everyday. Things have been hard with covid, we've been apart 315 days, which is, to most LDR's silly, but he's my only friend. I...am a pretty lonely person, but that's alright. I have about 2 other close friends and that's all I really need. He's literally my best friend. He's been with me through everything. Like I said, I have a toxic home-life, my father is a POS and my mother...she isn't much better. Before him, I knew there was something mentally wrong with me, and to this day my parents still don't really believe I have an anxiety disorder and I quite possibly could be depressed. (not being dramatic it's rough.) He is also my first, well everything just about. This is the first real-real relationship I've been in, he was my first kiss, my first slow-dance, my first everything. He's so timid and gentle and knows exactly how I'm feeling even if I don't tell him initially. He tells me he's proud of me, and the first time he told me that, I broke down into tears. No one has ever ever told me they were proud of me, he sees the smallest steps I take and he recognizing me for them. I've been working my hardest on not apologizing so often and getting a grasp on my anxiety. I know to some now, it's so silly to think that you're first relationship is the one you're gonna marry. But I so truly believe he'll be the one I marry, I want to get married to him, I want to have a life with him. These past 4 years, I haven't felt sad, like ""unneeded"" sad, of course I have days, but he's literally lit my life up. I wrote a poem about/for him last year and in the poem, I talk about how he re-lit my ""spark"". My spark is well myself, my personality, my happiness, my passions my all of it. I don't think I could ever begin to repay him. With everything he's done...I'm overjoyed. And I tell him all of this everyday and he takes it with such modesty, or ""I know I'm all these things, but so are you"" He knows me, he knows who I am, he's the first person to ever willfully get to know who I am, and to love every, single, inch of me, even the parts I can't love right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'll stop there for now, I could novels upon novels about my love for him, but I think now is a good time to stop. I'm currently working on a song for him, It's been a really long writing process but I think it's coming along well. Anyway, thanks for reading that whole long winded thing, :)"

"You're WelcomeThat's the only note I'm going to leave: you're welcome. Killing myself would be doing the world a favor. I live at home with my dad and sister at 22 because I can't afford to move out on a hostess' s salary. I can't get a better job because I don't have a driver's licence after failing the test three times. I've only got one friend in town and she's moving away soon, plus she does so much for me regularly (driving me around, buying me food, putting up with my existence) while I can do basically nothing for her. My very best friend is also my ex girlfriend, we've known each other for years but only ever online. She broke up with me because my emotional issues and depression were too much and were causing her grief. I think I'll always love her but she never wants to date me again, and doesn't want to be ""best friends"" anymore either,  just friends. 

My family is very poor, I know that my death (plus the savings in my bank account) will help everyone with bills. In fact, I can't think of a reason not to kill myself. The only reasons I can think of to stay alive are selfish: I'm looking forward to the ff7 remake, I want to open my christmas presents, I want to make my best friend care enough about me to /want/ to be my best friend again. But those are selfish, all things I want, not things that will benefit others.

Reasons I should end it: financial relief for my family who hates me, freedom for my ex who I think only stays my friend out of pity, if I do it now my friend can go to my funeral before she moves, the bosses at work don't like me and I think they think I'm incompetent. 

I have a plan, I just have to obtain heavy ankle weights and vodka, then wait to be home alone. I'm not going to leave a detailed note, but I wanted to get it all out somewhere. Thanks for listening, sorry for taking up your time. "

A few of my friends from high school texted me about this guy's sudden passing. All of them said things like ""This is really an eye opener about my own mortality"" or ""This really goes to show that you should live life to the fullest, because you never know when you could just drop dead suddenly"".

"I think I've hit that breaking point to convince me to suicideI went through an extremely hard break up a bit over a month ago. Our relationship lasted 3 years and we've talked about marriage and children when we both got stable jobs. I saw my whole future with this person. Now I feel like everything in my life is crashing down since then. I haven't been able to catch a break since we broke up. Nothing has been going right. It doesn't help that I've been running back to him and getting mixed signals. He would be straight with me one day and then let me cuddle another among other things. I am so confused and broken. He just recently called it completely off and this feels like the breaking point. 

I am constantly bombarding myself with thoughts of suicide. Every day it gets louder and louder. So I hit the breaking point. Just yesterday I wrote a 3 page long suicide note and it made me feel so happy. I won't have to think about anything ever again if I succeed in overdosing. I already made my plan. I just don't know when I should do it. I'm hoping that it works. 

I know everyone will tell me that things get better, but no. This relationship was a huge support pillar in my life. I would do anything to get it back. I can't think of anything else. I can't imagine anyone else. He was my partner. Those feelings aren't fading. Things are only getting harder. I really need someone to talk to but the only person I want is him."

"My dad beats my autistic brother and I am tired of it Yep, the title says it all. I heard my dad beat him with a belt for 2 minutes straight because my brother went to someone's house without permission. We are in lockdown for 7 days, so the rules are tighter. My mother tries to tell my dad to stop beating my brother with a belt, and it worked, until now. Now, my brother is not allowed to go to people's houses, and, apparently, my brother also goes to her ex's house and a ex teacher of his. He doesn't use common sense very often after our first major lockdown, so he got himself into this situation.

I have uncommon interests, that I know - I'm into science, gaming, technology, scifi and making my own clothes, and while I don't believe my interests to be superior to those of other women my age, conversations become more complicated. If I ever do talk about my interests, I get weird looks and feel that I should keep quiet.  
  
I used to have male friends with whom I shared aforementioned interests, but (and believe me when I say this complicated my friendships with them, I did not enjoy the situations I got myself into) they started falling for me. When I rejected their advancements, many would end our friendships or even badmouth me to others. I figured they didn't value my friendship like I valued theirs and felt increasingly lonely.  
Currently I have a few friends I feel comfortable with, but some are nearly always busy, and others are into drugs and drinking, which I am not. I feel alone in everything, I just wish I could be able to like common things.

3. No money
4. No ""true"" independence.
5. No purpose
6. No future

Itâs all iâve been doing for the past 4 years and iâm not even 18. I dropped out of highschool freshman year and have been trying to push my self just to do anything whatsoever that could help my future in anyway, but I never go through with my plans.

Iâm scared of having no future, yet I have no drive to do anything besides lay around and slowly kill myself. Iâm a walking breathing contradiction and I hate myself for it. Thereâs no reason I canât be doing productive things, I just donât, and it feels like I canât. I hate it so much and I want help. Just to be clear, I have no current plans on committing suicide, but if I ever got into a bad enough financial and general situation as an adult, I feel like I wouldnât hesitate."

"death is all I think abouttoday I thought about jumping in front of a car, slitting my wrists, jumping off one of my school buildings that's tall enough. I think of new ways to die every day. My GPA went to shit last fall during a major depressive episode and I added an extra year of university because of it. I am forced to work minimum wage jobs and I can't really pursue my short term dreams because I'm too busy. I don't feel like I fit in anywhere because I'm just too aware. Only a few people care about me and I figure the earlier I die the better so I don't hurt anyone else. Today I missed two big assignments because I'm an idiot and didn't check past the five I completed on time. I am sick of believing I can be something and achieve goals when I'm nothing and do not matter. I simply can not fathom a world where I do anything but continue to abhor life itself. Grad school seems impossible. Working in any of the industries I want to work is impossible. I was told all my life I'm gonna be someone because I have talent, or good personality or I'm a good person. but all I want to do is sleep. I'm not good enough to continue living. my life is but a small drop in the collective concious. work might miss me bc they will need to fulfill a position. school wouldn't care and I'd probably get a news article and a memorial from people that never cared about me but I them. my family would be hurt but would be motivated to do better I hope. they never believed in therapy or medication so thanks I guess. my few friends would miss me but I hope they would continue to do their art and do good for me. I just don't agree with this world. how we fight to make money and how you need money for everything. how GPA is really all that matters if you wanna move forward. how chemistry and bio are worth more than happiness. how nothing matters when you want to die. even when I fight like all the great anime heros to stay alive. I just feel like I can't win. I'm embarrassing. Untalented. not a good person. a worse creature. defective in the mind to the point where I'd rather be dead then try to live before I've experienced any real life at all."

"I donât know what else to sayIâve been feeling really lonely these days. Despite hanging with friends and shit. Got a lot of problems going on at home. A lot of inner struggles. And just been expecting too much of my friends. 

Itâs like I want the perfect answer. But itâll never come. Every night I ask myself what the fuck am I doing here. Play this same fucking piece on repeat. Over and over. It never ends. 

Nothing is enough to feed my pain. 

In all honesty. I know my life will end in suicide. Nothing will stop it. Tough love, softness. Nothing. Iâll die one day by my own hand. All I can blame though is myself, for not having the strength to hold on. 

My purpose in life was to live, feel pain and then die. And bring pain upon those I love so theyâll understand mental illness and how serious it is. How misunderstood it is and how itâs often swept under the rug. To many people think mental illness is a choice... itâs not. I didnât ask to be fucking depressed or suicidal. 

Hopefully I can survive tonight. "

I NEED TO MAKE MUSIC

and I'm so fucking sorry to myself, oh my little prince I'm so sorry I never gave you what you wanted... I'm so sorry I always thought you were trash... I swear if i get better from this I will love you and give whatever it is that you want/deserve ... I love you so much, dear me.. I know you want to make music, and I know you want to tattoo yourself, and whatever else it is that you want. you do deserve those things, and you are a great person, since the day you were born. I still can remember when you first watched that weird movie when you were like, 3 years old or something, and the music in it was so beautiful that you were sure that it was the most beautiful thing in the universe at that time.. and how you thought in your young innocent mind that it would be the purpose of your whole existence somehow.. I'm so sorry my little prince... i love you so much, and so does music... and I will never let your magic die again"

Throughout high school I was getting great marks, and people were always telling me how I could be a doctor or a lawyer, but that seems impossible right now.

I know getting bad marks is really insignificant compared to some of the things people go through, but my intelligence has been the only thing I could ever be proud of. I don't have anything else in my life. I'm ashamed to tell my parents about how I've failed my subjects, even though they both failed some when they were at university. I just feel like shit."

"It's me againSorry, I have no one to share this with, it's about my girlfriend, she's the only one who I can trust but I donÂ´t want to worry her or to put pressure on her, and I don't trust my family or friends to ask for help.

We have been together for about 2 years and few months, and now she's my entire life. But over the past year I haven't been offering her the best I could, I've been not listening to her about what I can do to improve the relationship, and she has been not totally enjoying us. I know I'm guilty about too many things, and I has been on me the whole time. 

I don't even know what I'm writting, I just want her to be happy,  I want her to love me for who I am, and I know she does, but I'd wish it would be enough. 

I don't want to worry her because over the past weeks, whenever something bad happened, suicide thouhgts came to me, and, as time passes, those thoughts become stronger adn stronger. We've just chat about breaking up, and she's my life, I have no one else to be my support, and I want no one else. Now, if I have to live without her, I just want to die."

"I am losing my fucking marbles so Iâm going to rantI want to start this by saying this not a bait and Iâm not fishing for attention by posting this I just really need to rant to calm myself down. Thanks ahead If you read all this, i know itâs going to be a lot. 

My dad always thinks when I talk about this shit, itâs just me bathing in self pity, like itâs just a way to get attention but itâs fucking not. Iâm slowly but surely going fucking insane. I know my dad thinks this is just an excuse for me to half ass being alive but I canât help it. Really Iâm trying, I even went to therapy and took all the meds they gave me but I really cannot see a point to keep trying if nothing is working. I was kind of getting better for a little. I was trying to avoid my triggers like certain people or situations but now Iâve found myself sheltered off from the real world. But this intense urge to kill myself keeps coming back no matter how hard I try. For a while I switched to the bottle as a desperate attempt to smother these intense impulses, but it was counter productive because I would end up just being miserable while i was drunk, which made suicide seem justifiable. All I can do now is get angry because at least when Iâm angry Iâm not sad. For at least 10 years all I would do is be sad. Iâm 17 now and when I was 7 my sister who was 9 at the time got molested in front of me by our baby sitters son and all I could do was feel ashamed in myself for not doing anything. All the while My mom would cry to me drunk out of her mind because my father left her. I had a little game I would play with her called âthe bird who says donât cryâ where I would just lean into her and say âdonât cry!â. Thatâs all I can think of now. All this shit that happened when i was so young keeps coming back and boiling into anger aimed in no particular direction. Talking about it helps but only so much. 

The only thing keeping me going is my family. My mom is a bipolar drug addict, my brother is just as angry at nothing as I am (plus heâs slowly but surely developing an extremely intense alcohol problem to try and cope with everything), my other brother is a recovering drug addict, and my sister is my best friend who has kept me going in some dark ass times. Sheâs too strong to tarnish for my own selfish reasoning, but i know sheâs got a lot sheâs repressing. My whole family is on the brink besides my dad who is happy to live in blissful ignorance to the situation. I canât throw them over board for myself. It wouldnât be fair. But god damn itâs getting hard to keep going. 

Thank you if you read this.

Iâm thinking about killing myself again after ages of not being actively suicidalItâs just been a hard few weeks and everything is turning into shit again. I canât get good sleep at night because I keep on waking up in the middle of the night with thoughts about how Iâm such a failure and that everything would be okay if I just hung myself. Iâm feeling actively suicidal again and IDK what to do
"Girlfriend of 1 year and my everything left me..I know 1 year. WOW SO MUCH TO CRY AND BE DEPRESSED ABOUT. I loved this girl since Day 1. She was my first for sex, as was I. She was my first long term relationship. Everything was going good.  


I'm 18 and she's 17. She was amazing.. She was everything I could have ever of asked for.. We've done everything together.. She helped me get my life back on track. Had her Dad help me get my car up and running, motivated me to go to school and graduate, she showed me how to love and trust again. She had the softest skin.. She was gorgeous in my eyes. And most importantly was her attitude... she always had a beautiful smile no matter if it was fake for that day.. She gave me life when I needed it most..  


I almost OD'd, hung myself, drove into oncoming traffic.. She was there. Every little bit of sadness I felt, she fixed it with kisses and custom therapy done by her. 

  
Ever since I was a kid and understood Spanish, my dad would always say ""Don't be sad, never show emotion for anyone or anything. You're a man and men don't cry."" Every since then I don't recount my feelings with anyone but sometimes I would with this girl.. Some days I would forget how lucky I am to have her and I didn't talk to her about my feelings.. She gave me the best she could do, as I did her with my fucked up situation. I tried talking but eventually pushed her away, due to my silence, my lack of opening up to her...  


My biggest mistake.. asking for nudes.. she didn't like that and now she's gone.

"Some people deserve to dieHey, thank you all for taking the time to help me with a dilemma. I need an honest opinion and please donât feel bad for me.

When I was a young kid (barely a teen), I did something that I can never forgive myself for.  I donât feel like getting into the details, but this is something that I have regretted my entire life. It has gotten to the point where I just cant live with happiness. No matter how hard I try I cant forgive myself. I was just a young dumb kid but there are some things in life that haunt you forever and no matter what, you cant go back in time and make things right.

Iâm not bad person but this childhood event has haunted me forever. Iâve been suffering from severe depression and anxiety for the past 7 years and I just cant take it anymore. Life is not something I enjoy or ever will be able to enjoy. Every second for the past 7 years has been me waiting to die. Iâve coincidentally even been in multiple accidents and every time I just seem to fucking make it out alive. I just want to end it all but I donât know the right way to do it. I am not a person that deserves to live. Please just trust me on this.

Please donât try to sympathize with me as I am not someone who deserves your sympathy. I am a terrible human being who needs to be dead. How should I go about this. Thank you"
"My rant about women in general And by women, I mean raisins

And by general, I mean in cookies 

Why the hell do raisin cookies exist? Most the time you think theyâre a delicious chocolate chip cookie, and then BAM. Itâs a nasty ass raisin that tastes awful. 

The only person I could think that would eat a raisin cookie is a homeless person whoâs starving for food. Raisins do NOT belong in cookies. And the cookies themselves usually taste awful when it has raisins in them, like the dough is hard or too chewy.

This has been my rant about raisins in cookies, this has nothing to do with women I just wanted to clickbait you."

Last year I had four hospital stays from suicide attempts and they were because I was feeling lonely.

"Lost & ConfusedSo yeah I think it's either tonight or this week, I have no clue when it's going to be my last day, everyday is another painful day, no parents to see, no family, everyone is jealous and hating on me because I am not depending on anyone, I barely see my mom like once every couple of months because she works abroad and she lives in a womens compound, and my father is a dickhead selfish person, that made me suffer for the past 20 years, I do thank him for educating me and putting me in the best schools and universities.

I am graduating this year, and everyday I am living is getting crazier, I never plan anything for the next day because I know it's going to be so fucked up, I have a girlfriend and she's so good and so nice to me, she treats me like nobody else, and unfortunately she lives far away from me, and I have to travel every time to see her and people say I am crazy that I spend shitload of resources and money just to see my girlfriend, though she's loyal and she would do anything and fight her parents just to see me, and I am thankful.

I tried almost anything in my life, from partying to getting drunk, from traveling from a city to another country, from driving the shittiest cars to driving the best cars, from hurting myself, to tattooing, to enjoyable pain, to sleeping 18-20 hours a day by forcing myself, except drugs and I would rather die than suffering with drugs, everyday I feel like I wanna jump from this 6th floor, it's pretty high, but it's amazing, the view and the jumping experience would be more than nice to jump and crush on the ground or even jump in the middle of nowhere in the sea.

I just want to fucking die, I have ADHD, emotions panic, panic attacks, I barely sleep like 2-3 hours a day and god knows what the fuck else I do have.

&amp;#x200B;

The want to want.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have never been a driven guy. I have always been one who steers clear from change, lingering in the status quo. I chose what university to go to with little to no research, I chose a major simply because I had to, I am who I am, where I am, because of uninformed decisions made through my own laziness and the constant harassment of friends and family urging, coaxing, begging me to try to be a positive member of society. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is I donât want that. I have little work ethic and have found no passions in life beyond napping and drinking. With the GPA I have earned through over indulging my finite pastimes the future ahead of me looks bleak and grim. Iâll get a mid range paying job at a reputable firm with a long and corporate sounding title thatâll do little but stroke my ego because in reality Iâll spend the next 30 years giving away my time, passion, and sanity to a concrete building and a fat man behind a desk. I see people grasping at even the smallest opportunities with both hands but I can barely rouse myself to watch them as they pass me by. 

&amp;#x200B;

My father is a self made millionaire, born in a small European town, both my sisters were lucky enough to go to a great high school where they both passed with mostly all A\*s (I remember my sister crying because she only got an A on something in school, she thought sheâd never go to university.) Me? I pat myself on the back when I go to all my classes in a week, or when I didnât do as bad on the test I didnât study for as I thought I had.

&amp;#x200B;

Iâm constantly surrounded by people whoâs average is my extra mile, who are driven and emboldened by the things that they do, who have a set path in front of them and are doing everything in their power to push themselves forward. I have squandered countless chances, where others have spent their entire life climbing to, I have found myself simply drifting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess Iâm not sure where to go from here. I am dissatisfied with mediocrity, yet have no passion to change it. I want to want the things that get people out of bed in the morning, but I donât. Every second of every day feels like I am just waiting, waiting for something more, waiting for something to put butterflies in my stomach again, waiting for something to remind me that life shouldnât be just waiting."
"so how do you actually MEET someone I have no issues actually talking to people but how TF do I meet people. Like to eventually get a relationship

I'm about to turn 14. Doing hybrid school but about to go back 5 days"
"Currently drunk, trying to come up with good reasons not to hang myselfSorry for the crappy user name, I didn't want this to be under my main in case I man up and execute. Bad karma to lead any investigation back here

Also plz forgive any typos I'm sort of drunk right now.

I am in my early thirties. Tried to kill myself in my teens (botched, internet info on drug lethality not as readily available back then) then again in my late twenties (also botched, tried a jump when someone was nearby; if I'd been thinking straight I would've waited till they left)

Had a lot of treament. Medication, multiple hospitaliztions, ECT. Tried to kill myself IN the hospital, chickened out because I felt bad about my roommate finding me (she was going through some tough times already). Still got caught at the end of the attempt and was stuck inside a stupid long time.

I don;t want to go back to hospital. It does no good. ECT is also terrible, lost several months of memory. 

Problem is I also don't want to live anymore. I tried changing jobs, moving different places, improving my lifestyle, but it's all crap. In the end the problem is me and I'm not changing. I've tried, because there are a lot of things about me I know need fixing, but I keep messing up. I have anger problems, very blunt, often upset people without meaning to. My anger is usually taken out on myself, never physically attacked anyone else, but I can definitely be verbally hrash even when I'm trying to be better. I cuss and drink and I'm blunt. Just not a nice person to be around.

I iused to self-harm but gave it up, got lots of tattoos to dissuade myself. I feel like even more of a failure for considering going back to it.

I'm in a relationship, but we argue a lot, I'm always causing problems. He finds it really hard to deal with my anger. I get it, anger is not acceptable like passivity or withdrawal or sadness. Unfortunately almost every negative emotion I feel comes out as anger (it's what I knew as a kid) and almost always at myself. I'm not in contact with my family (bad history) so he is the only person who is likely to be affected when I die. I've tried to make new friends since the last move, reach out to people with shared interests, even offered to help ppl move apartments. Sometimes it works, but I get rejected a lot. Maybe 15% sucess rate? I have to figure it's something in my personality. The few people who do seem to like me don't know anything about my history and I'm too ashsmed to ask them for help.

I have a good education (doctorate) and an alrightish job, so that's good, but - doesn't fix who I am and how much I mess up. Not enough to live for. 

I'm not sure antyhing is enough to live for when you slog through each day sick to death of yourself and your own bullshit. Things get a little better, but they always ALWAYS get worse again. The highs usually turn into paranoid, psychotic lows of their own. Even if they don't, they;re not worth it.

tl;dr (because I'm fucking boring myself) Right now I am sitting indoors, alone, trying to think of reasons not to go and hang myself in the garage.
So far I have come up with: it might go wrong.
Fortunately, I'm both reasonably sure I know what I'm doing by now and that it's worth the risk.

But I also know I've been here ebfore, I didn't die, and a few fun things happened in the better times. So I wanted to post in this sub and - actually I don't know. I feel like a huge attention seeker, really close to CTRL-A-DELing the lot. But maybe hearing from people who've been there too would help"
i hate how much my emotions are influenced people who know me cleary see that when im at my top they know and when im at the bottome they lnow i hate it i wish i could just not be crazy idk

"Love hurts enough to make me consider a way to end it.After being together for almost 2 years, we broke up two weeks ago. However, we still maintained contact. He's decided against it now. So, now, it is really over and the pain hurts way too much. I want to numb it. Not exactly kill myself but kill the pain. Kill the love. I can't stop crying. The past 2 weeks, I was able to fool myself. I knew it was over but was glad we were still talking and hanging out in the same social scene. Now, he's gone. Reality is kicking my ass. My defense instincts wants me to numb it. I have the means to do so but am trying to fight it. I don't know what to do."

My fucking paycheck didnât come on and I had to borrow more money to get to fucking work, as if I work for free. I canât pick up my medication because they donât ducking take Apple Pay, my bank account is overdrawn from a purchase I MADE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. Iâve been getting angry a lot lately and I canât fucking do anything but feel absolute rage. Again, I DONT FUCKING WORK FOR FREE WHERE IS MY FUCKING PAYCHECK.

"Im going to use a shotgun - is it better in the mouth or side of the head?Putting the barrel in my mouth will be easier but I'm not sure how this will be effective, how will I die from shooting in my mouth besides putting a hole in the back of my head?





I want to do it to the right side of my head which will probably be effective but extremely difficult to do. I'm afraid if I use one hand to hold it and pull the trigger with the other that any kind of kickback is going to fuck it all up but I don't think I can get my foot around to use my toe to pull the trigger lol "

I just want to get some sleeping pills, take them, and just go into some water and knock out and drown."

"Conclusion of me starting to go out with a ""peer group""It's summer 2017.   
People invited me out to go partying with them and I agree because there's nothing better to do. I quickly get used to having nothing better to do. There's not really much going on for me though. I'm the quiet one that drinks the most but is always on his phone reading something. I don't talk much and I never really would. There's this nice girl that made me feel appreciated. I tried getting close to her around halloween 2017. She doesn't want to. I understand. Fast forward to december. She feels lost and gets back to the one guy that knows the feeling of being lost better than anyone. Since I was young my parents would never get my struggle. I got my pants and underwear pulled down in fifth grade and was punished as much as the guy who did it because I was trying to hurt him for it right after he did it. My parents never talked about it. I never had any help get rid of the baggage that was given to me from the get-go. My biological mother abuses me more and more year for year because she won't keep contact with people that she thought dear of, because ""she only needs me and my biological father"". But he's not the one to bear the burden of her mental issues ir the problems she has, because he's not the one that's at home because he can't stand the school that he's forced to stay in to not get thrown out.  
I feel like I only exist to help my mother with her emotional baggage.   
Back to the girl again. I have a hard time at home, and she's the only one being supportive. I quickly fell for her completely, but all of my sown relationship seeds would ever sprout to a youth romance.       
Jan 26th 2018      
She tells me that she after all doesn't want to have a relationship with me, I get pretty sad but understand it. In the meantime she kinda forced me into therapy which wouldn't help me in the end, but that's really whatever. We continue, or rather I, to regularly message the other one. 2 months later after still dating she asked me about wanting to do it with the one I love. Of course I'd said yes, but it would never come to be, since she was too afraid to break of the last working machanism of someones brain. How wrong she was there... It goes on and on and on, we never worked out, she had a couple bfs but always would keep contact with me since she dyed my hair once a month. Forgot to mention that she openly told my friends that I was pretty disgusting didn't I? So. We still talk into the late 2018. I help her get through her drama, but what does she care when I try to kill myself at night with pills and drugs? Right. Her boyfriend quit the relationship and now she's sad. ""you're the only one to make me laugh"". Get what that was about now.     December 2018    
My only good friend I'd say quit a relationship too with a really toxic person. That toxic person threatened him with ending her life if he quit the relationship. You can guess how I hate her for talking like that. This other guy from the group still hangs out with her, and I grow to hate him for it. He does some racist stuff and I now can't stand him and avoid him. The girl I talked about for quite a bit, let's give her a name now, hannah, brought up an argument because I had just stopped messaging her for no reason apparently. Remember how I said I'd been the one to always message her? Well I grew sick of it. And for some stupid reason she said that she was air to me as soon as she had a bf. Though I helped her through 3 relationships and coupled her with one of my closest friends at the time, essentially ruining my friendship with him. She sees her fault, though doesn't admit it, but hey take a guess, I'm too depressed and suicidal to take care of her then too. We don't talk all december. We were at the same places a couple of times, but I was sick of engaging conversations with her so I waited for her to do it. She never did. Didn't even greet me on new years eve when we were at the same party. Later in the night she comes and triea to talk to me, I told her it's too late for that now if you can't even greet me, she walks off, not caring whatsoever. No contact since then. Now let's go over the last 3 months. When my mother makes me uncomfortable I can't control myself anymore and smash my hand on my desk or similar to the point where I can't really grip things anymore. I talked to her about it multiple times, how it started making me physically sick and mentally ill to the point where I got diagnosabally ill. I'm now thinking about dealing drugs to have enough money for my own. Now I only take weed and alcohol, I'm highly against anything else but with my alcoholism I don't think anythimg could kill me faster. Really being honest the women that have... plagued... my life to this point I'm back to square one where I can't basically talk to females in person and try to do so at any cost. I feel like any day is going to get me down from this 4th story balcony in a couple seconds. I don't want the restriction of being in an enclosed facility for people that try suicide or anything. I want to get rid of my non caring patents and feel appreciated by someone. But that won't ever happen as life shows me. Being told by the only guy in the peer that knows what frustration is that the others can't stand me because I'm so awkward, but they are the ones that are privileged enough to have self confidence and don't understand what it's like to just feel empty on a sunny day near the park when you're sober. I'm sitting here writing this at 2 am because I'm slowly growing too insomnic to sleep. U always have the crying kinda dry throat, but I can't cry. I don't ever want to school again. I stopped talking to most of my what I once called them ""friends"" since they obviously don't want to tolerate me when I'm in a bad mood. I probably will be up all night thinking only about how much I hate myself again but won't have the energy to do anything about it.    
But maybe I'll save up and just do something about it. It'll take care of all my problems at once.        
  It'll leave me happy without the struggle of dealing with people that don't know how deep the feeling of being empty can be, or how shallow they think when I say that I feel like I always do. "
"wait do British people actually have a sex drive? I never really pictured British people having much of a sex drive, like maybe there was something in the tea that would obliterate their libido.

Yet again I did hear of British porn, so maybe it is a one a year thing?"

"I just want to die, if I had the courage I'd finish everything nowI don't know much to say. I'm too mentally fucked up, I'm done. Life is shit, this planet is shit, it's not worth it. It's just pain and happiness is pretending everything is fine when it isn't. Everyday, I look at people's faces it's all fake and bullshit.

I'm a failure, I have no future, I can't be independent, my friends left me, I have Social Anxiety, I just want to die. I'm done. They ruined me. Bullying ruined me. Those imbecile kids done it. Society done it. Nobody ever cared and here I am, absolutely destroyed. I'm a nobody just failing. All the opportunities and I'm wasting them and time. 

You try to pretend it's fine but it's not, and then you try to get stuff sorted out but nothing works. Fuck this.

Also, nobody ever cares, not even your ""best friends"". They just don't. They can't fix my life anyway, why the fuck would they care. Then when I fucking pay attention to what they're saying I'm an idiot. Because I care and they don't. 

No wonder. Nobody contacts me anymore. Fucking assholes too. If one day I kill myself I hope they feel guilty as shit. It's their fucking fault too."
"Post funny shit hereI just don't see the point in putting up with life. Don't feel like explaining, I just want to lay down. Can y'all leave some giggles/motivational/literally whatever here for when I wake up? Just something to read would be fine, I guess. "

Iâm not afraidI think Iâll start being an asshole to my loved ones.  I donât want them to love me when I end it.  Iâm no longer scared of pulling the trigger.  Itâs going to come sooner or later.  Finally Iâll have something in my control.

"Help!? How do I get out of this feeling??Iâve had some form of depression for at least the last 7-8 years but I seem to have high functioning depression. My boyfriend broke up with me three weeks ago now. He said I love you first, he brought up moving in and marriage and kids first and he brought it up even a month before we broke up. He wasnât cheating technically but when he broke up with me he said that he never loved me and that he didnât care he was hurting me when he texted his ex once. (Long story but I know he was being honest when he said he only texted her once). Iâm afraid of my reaction now. Its been 3 weeks since the initial breakup and Iâm still having very vivid suicidal thoughts. Iâve looked up methods 24/7, Iâve tried journaling my feelings before I noticed I was just ruminating, Iâve tried going outside and talking with my family, Iâve seen my therapist 3x a week since it happened and sheâs recommending hospitalization. This canât be a normal reaction to a breakup. Yes, this is the first breakup where I was fully in the relationship and genuinely thought I was going to be with him for the rest of my life but how is it that heâs gone now and I donât give a single care in the world about the rest of my life. I try to hard to write down things I should be living for but I donât care about any of them. Iâve removed him from my social media because it just hurts but even that hasnât stopped me from thinking about him. Day and night itâs all I do. Iâm either googling how to kill myself and sometimes googling how to feel better before feeling like itâs impossible and go back to finding ways to kill myself or Iâm googling why he did this. Heâs a decent guy from a decent family and for the most part heâs been a good ex. Thatâs why this breakup is so hard for me to accept. We were a good team! We would have disagreements but we never fought or purposely said hurtful things to one another, we would always talk it out. He treated me very well and would always be there for me. I look at these things online saying itâs better to be broken up if the relationship was bad for me but it doesnât apply because this relationship was the best one Iâve ever had in my life and I donât understand why itâs over. I canât take care of myself. I canât work and took this week off, I canât sleep for more than 3 hours consecutively, I canât eat or drink (118lbs to 110 this past week. I met with my primary doctor to get antidepressants and weighed 118 just last Wednesday and now Iâm 110). Iâve talked to the national suicide hotline a bunch of times and when I talk itâs like they arenât even listening to what Iâm saying. Someone please help me. I feel like Iâve tried all the standard âget betterâ things and nothing is helping and Iâve gotten to the point where the only thing stopping me from killing myself is the fear that it wonât be successful and Iâll live life as a vegetable.

"iâm sick of everything at this point and wish i could just die in any wayi just want everything to stop and i wish i could get into some kind of accident that could kill me so i wonât have to go through this. it doesnât help that i always hurt people too. i donât mean it, it just happens. iâve tried suicide hotlines multiple times and they donât help. iâm 18 and unemployed and my parents wonât let me get a job until covid vaccines come out and i feel so behind because all of my other friends either have a job, are in college, or both. iâve been dealing with suicidal thoughts off and on in my life since late middle school and now iâm out of school and still going through hell. the last time i tried to i was going to sneak out my window and harm myself but i couldnât get my screen open so i just ended up crying myself to sleep. iâm not out as trans to my parents yet and iâm not sure when iâll be able to and that really digs at me too. itâs getting to the point where iâm making more and more plans on what to do and how to do it. i purposely stay up late since thatâs when i have time to be alone and sleep late so i have less of the day to go through. iâve thought about doing drugs so i can have something numb the pain. i just want everything to end for me."
"I think Iâm delusionalI feel like everythingâs my fault and I keep imagining things...like what if me breaking the microwave a year ago led to me single handedly killing my family. What if we all have cancer, and I got the worst of it.

What if I have a weird disease that I passed on to everyone else.

What if...

You get the idea.

I feel like everythingâs my fault.

"The first time i wanted to hit a child So yesterday i decided to sin and get instagram again because i had a funny idea for an account. I then saw the most disgusting thing ever. My cousin, my 11 year old cousin changed her name to ""rylenrae""... Just saying her last name is not rae. So yeah i think im gonna go fly down there and smack her."
"Breaking down Walls ( in Therapy)Okay - so this is my Situation , I'll try to make this as understandable as possible.

Im an 18 year old female , have quite a long history of emotional/psychological abuse from my father , teachers and classmates.
besides that i moved loads as a kid.

I've also had my share of traumatic/scarring encounters of a sexual nature when i was young , which led me to form unhealthy boundries when it came to sex , even bleeding into normal relationships to male friends.

because of this I've developed a severe disconnect between the way i think it is appropriate to feel , and how i do feel.

It's gotten to a point where i cannot tell you if how im reacting is ""self-conditioning"" or my actual feelings.
I learned early on in my life that emotions can be highly discrutive and hurtful.
( my father was unpredictable in that regard , emotionally cold and disassociated or incredibly personal , either suddenly loving and charming or hateful and angry)
So i guess thats where i learned it.

btw: I live with my mother and step-father now after they divorced , I also have a good relationship to my older brother who lives on his own now.

I eventially (after years of suicidal thoughts , self-harm and generally fucked up shit happening in my head and life)

i finally decided to get professional help.

i was diagnosed with moderate-severe depression in the first couple of months , my therapist is quite sure thats not all though.

But , the more i get through to myself , the more i hate with a passion what ive been trying to regulate my entire life , obsessively.

I have flashes of violence- once or twice every 2 weeks.
 It started as creepy images , almost funny sometimes.
but recently it has escelated into full seconds-long video clips of strangers being tortured , maimed and killed.
with sound and everything , and no matter what i do , nothing helps , i can only wait for it to stop.

im not involved in any way with the torture , i am just forced to watch it happen.
there is a lot more symptoms and wierd bits.
but this is already long so-


tldr:

-Shitty past
-therapy 
-the horror continues in a clipshow in my brain starring strangers.
-I thought i was doing alright , but the more i uncover , the crazier i feel.

i feel like im just waiting for someone to finally give me that final push to jump off of a brudge to be honest.

thoughts? help? 
hit me.

There are a lot of people with anxiety/self esteem/... issues who would rather never been seen in public at all (you guessed it that's me) and feel super fucking uncomfortable if they can't wear a hood to cover up their face. Idk if i speak for all but it literally worsens my  anxiety a hundred fold when i have to take it off. I get so anxious it's insane.

"I'm already planning to end my life as soon as I see a fixed number of escorts to fill that gaping hole in my life. Any ideas if CO poisoning is the least painful way to go?For context, ive been rejected all my life and im preparing to end it all once I see at least 20 escorts just so I know what physical intimacy is like before I die."
"Back at it againOne of the girst things I did when I got used to being online was search gor interesting suicide stories, less painful suicide methods. At first I thought bI just found it interesting, i wasn't going to do it. But as time went by I realized i didn't really have enough to live for. I was really trying to find a good way to kill myself. I was 12 years old. After that I got better, moved, started to pay attention to school. It wasn't a recovery from my obvious depression but I stopped thinking about it, i had things that kept me busy. 
It's been ten years since I realized that I wanted to kill myself, and I'm here again, researching the less painful way I can do it without alarming anyone or bringing attention to myself. My life went downhill and I don't really expect for anything to distract me. If I can eat and sleep another day, and then the next and so on, maybe I'll take longer to do it. If my situation becomes too desperate too soon, I'll do it as soon as possible. But I feel like I've always known I'd be ending my own life."
"I'm trying to kill myself by dehydrationWell i decided that i won't drink anything anymore. I drank last time yesterday evening (now it's afternoon 15:30) plus because i'm weak i drank this afternoon 1 glass (~200 ml) of cola. But that's all. It's strange because after the cola i regret it and felt that it was a mistake and i'm a piece of shit because i drank it and i started feeling this with food (again... (i felt it a lot with food in the past)).

so yea, i know that probably it won't kill me because i'll faint and hospital will save me but actually it's a good method because noone would think that i tried to kill myself so i can do it anytime and one time my kidneys/other organs will give up or there'll be time when i have noone to call the emergency. so sooner or later it'll kill me. and it's pretty neat because i already started slowly loosing my sense of reality (i can't focus, i'm dizzy etc) and that's exactly what i want!!

I want their last memory of me to be something good not that i killed myself. Hoping they'll just forget about me as time goes on. I think i might wait a little into early next year because i don't wanna ruin Christmas and we're moving soon so just think it'll be better to wait."

"I wonder who really caresI know its really selfish to say, but sometimes I wish I could just try killing myself (not succeeding) so I could simply see how people would react. How many of my ""friends"" would really care? I'm sure some would be sad, but how long would it last? How long would it take for them to go back to not caring about my depression?

I know people will be sad when I die, but does it really matter if they are? No one cared enough to try supporting me better when I was still breathing, so why should it matter if my death upsets them? 

Who knows, maybe I'll get to find out the answer to that question real soon. And then maybe I'll know."

"Itâs been said to death, but suicide can affect people you donât even consider.A family friend of mine committed suicide this morning. She was my neighbor growing up. She worked as a stylist and always encouraged me to express myself. As a kid, she would invite me and my brother over to swim in her pool. When I was experimenting with my gender expression in high school, she cut my hair and dyed it fun colors for me and always made me feel great about myself. As a young adult when I was battling depression, she invited me out to her horse farm and gave me an excuse to spend time outside. I have nothing but fond memories of her. Nobody knew about her depression. This morning she took her own life. When my brother called to tell me, I was at work. I had to step away and cry in the bathroom because it just broke my heart. Now Iâm sitting here in shock, writing this post to help me process my feelings.

If anyone reads this, please understand that more people care about you, love you, and appreciate you than you might realize. I doubt that she thought of me in her last moments, but I will never stop thinking about her and the impact she left on me."
"How does motivation from strangers help so much?Like many other people I haven't confided in anyone I know about my suicidal tendencies, but just browsing through forums and messageboards, hearing people out there say that things will get better and that happiness is a possibility helps me. It confounds me.

It's not just one incident, everytime I feel like I'd prefer going away I try and look out for some groups of strangers somewhere on the internet saying that things can be better than they are, and said strangers almost always help me, even if only a little bit.

Even if they're not actually responding to a message I posted, or know nothing about my particular situation, it still helps. The human psyche is so strange. These aren't reasoned arguments or links to studies that have done research with large samples or anything of the sort, just a simple ""hey, I'm sure you'll get better, good luck"" or something along those lines.

I just felt like typing that out, particularly shit day, I think I'll sit down for a long meditation session now.

Thanks people. Good luck to all of you :)"

"Freak on the sideWhy was I brought to this place in the first place. What good have I been. I'm not worthy of life. I'm a dustbin that needs to be emptied and dumped. Good riddance to me. I have brought zero value to anybody's life. I'm hanging on in vain. 

Someone told me to let go of the past and to move on and to just get over it. How do I do that when it won't let ME go. It's got a strangle hold on me and no matter how much I try to shake it off, it sticks.  

And I can't even make this choice easily because there are people who won't understand. How do I get away so that I can just do this!

Who do I think I am to just give up. But not giving up just means I linger on like a parasite. 

Which one is fickin worse?! Giving up or remaining a parasite? 

I can hear them ridiculing and deriding me with contempt right now, and it's ringing in my head."
"It feels like my mind wants to fly out from this bodyToo many things are wrong and Iâve tried too hard to make them better. And now I just want to leave. I know there must be a better place out there but I wonder why I and others have to suffer here... itâs not fair. 
I have problems inside my head I think, and then problems outside my head and all I can really conclude here is maybe Iâm too lazy to fix them or maybe they were never meant to be fixed? Iâm just so overwhelmed with everything and I just hate being an adult (Iâm 22). 

Iâm supposed to be figuring out college, how to get insurance because I canât be on either of my parents, how to save money. Iâm trying to figure out whatâs wrong with and why I think certain ways, get angry or upset or think thereâs signs directed to me or whatever. Iâm trying to figure out how to have energy to do anything at all. I work and after I work I canât do anything else. I always think I deserve a day off but I donât. I take 4 classes; it was 5 but I dropped out of one. And I am 3 weeks behind on all my homework. I donât even know where the time goes I guess I just sleep I really donât know. 

I only work 3 days a week which is a little under $200 paycheck and my friend who doesnt go to school makes me feel like shit and always asks me to go places and I just donât know what is wrong with her as to why they donât understand why I have no money. My dad has no money so Iâve had a lot of things that I needed to pay. My mom is retired and I donât ask her for money anyways because I genuinely feel no connection with her and it is the worst feeling in the world. 

People just donât like me either. I donât know what I do wrong I know I am awkward but Iâve never been mean.. I donât know. I just kind of mind my business most of the time and I canât fake being someone Iâm not... and so I just donât talk to that many people I guess. Everyone else seems to always have people interested in them just meeting them for the first time and with me... no one looks twice, no one cares.


Long story short; in every way possible I feel I donât fit in here. In every aspect. I feel like the time is coming closer to call it quits and the days move too fast"
"Iâm just getting worse and worseI made a throwaway account because Iâm too embarrassed to admit who I really am, but I need some help, or something. 
Iâm 26 now, Iâll be 27 in a couple months, and I just feel like a big pile of worthlessness. I donât have the motivation to do the things I love anymore... I used to paint, and I even had a few that won a few contests when I was in highschool, but whenever I try and pick up a brush now, I draw a blank, or I just canât seem to find the motivation to do anything. I used to enjoy playing video games, but even that doesnât seem to interest me these days. I donât hang out with my friends as much as I used to, and whenever we make plans, when the day actually comes, I just canât find the motivation to actually leave my house, and it kills me, because I cherish my friendships. Iâm afraid Iâm gonna lose them. 
The biggest thing that bothers me though, is the fact that Iâll never be happy like I was when I was in highschool. I would give up everything in my life right now to go back to my highschool years, and re-live it. I was happy, I didnât worry so much about everything, I didnât have to worry about an income to afford living... Maybe itâs selfish of me, idk, but I just wish I didnât feel like this every single day. 
Iâve resorted to drinking, almost everyday just to numb my mind. It works, but I canât help but feel like Iâm just spiraling out of control. 
Everything just seems so pointless now, and I just want to die."

it is 10:04 as of writing this, and itâs weird because I would usually be logging out of Minecraft and getting ready. IDK, I want my 10:00 downtime back"
Suicidal thoughts sneak up on meIm feeling so good and wouldnât even think about suicide and then hours go by and I donât remember what really happens but I feel like i canât take it anymore.  I donât really know how I got from point a to b but i did and i feel so awful and suicide becomes a realistic feeling and temptation.
Fuck you I won't do what you tell meFuck you depression you bitch. Fuck losing control. Fuck losing the plot. You will not control me. Though I feel absolutely sick with it.

"SelfishI'm so fucking selfish I miss my girlfriend I havent seen her in months because of lock down and she just told me shes not coming back till July (she went to see her parents just before we went into whole country lockdown) and now that we have gone into lvl 2 she can come back but shes decide to stay up their and get a job and earn some money for us to go flatting next year but I'm angry because we arent going to have our 1 year together and ik it's not much and people are having it much worse then I am but she's my main supporter for everything I do and not having her with me feels like I've lost everything I cant seem to stay happy and I have gotten back into self harm it was stupid of me to rely on someone so much in the first place but shes been the most supportive girlfriend i have ever had but i feel like she doesn't understand what I'm going through because shes in her safe/comfortable place with her parents and everything's glitter and rainbows while yes i may be boarding with my mum at this moment but i havent lived with my mum for years I've spent the last 5ish with my father while finishing school I'm 18 and I've almost completed my scuba diving trainer diploma but I'm not even happy about going back to that next week because I just feels so depressed and empty without her, her course is starting back up in july which is one of the reasons she gave me about not coming back now but I dont understand why she cant do all this down here with me I feel like she doesn't understand how I feel at all but then again I'm being a selfish asshole because shes going to be working to help us for a bond....but now she wont even end up spending that money on that as shes having to sell and buy a new car since her current one has put itself to sleep..... main thing of all of this is I cant get happy without her I'm being too needy and I know it but I just cant do things without her I wanted nothing more than for us to spend our 1 year together but shes choosing not to and tbh I dont think it really bothers her at all so why is it that I'm the only one suffering I feel like that throughout my life I've had nothing but bad luck and any time anything's started to get good it gets pulled out from underneath me I hate the way I am so much"

"Can't there be a sticky post for just ""talking""I don't want my own post and maybe I don't want the pressure of someone responding necessarily, but just to talk here. I feel like I come here post the same stuff, I've been alive now way longer than I wanted and am still here, but this is still a way out for me. I don't know what to respond when someone asks me what's wrong because there is way too much and I don't have the energy to explain. The bottom line is I'm in pain all the time for various reasons. I tried to make something of my life and now have been brought down to nothing and things keep pushing me farther. While I've been told I'm tenacious and a fighter and all this stuff, I feel extremely exhausted and weak. I can't stand up anymore. I just feel done. Honestly there really isn't much to say to me, so I don't know why my purpose is. I just don't know. "

"listening the Fallingforyou and ViBiNg What time you coming out?
We started losing light
I'll never make it right
If you don't wander off
I'm so excited for the night
All we need's my bike and your enormous house
You said some day we might
When I'm closer to your height, 
Till then we'll knock around and see
If you're all I need
Don't you see me I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
On this night, and in this light
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you
And maybe you, change your mind 
(I think I'm falling, I think I'm falling)
I'm caught on your coat again
You said, ""Oh no, it's fine""
I read between the lines and touched your leg again (again)
I'll take it one day at a time
Soon you will be mine, oh, but I want you now (I want you now)
When the smoke is in your eyes, you look so alive
Do you fancy sitting down with me maybe
'Cause you're all I need
According to your heart
My place is not deliberate
Feeling of your arms
I don't want to be your friend, I want to kiss your neck
Don't you see me I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
On this night, and in this light
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you

"I think I'm going to do it tomorrowI don't know. I'm 21 years old and I've been having suicidal thoughts for about six months now. I own a house with my girlfriend. We fight a lot. I don't have much in common with her. 

No job. I can't seem to keep one. Money has been the biggest problem in my life. I know that I only have myself to blame for that. I really wish that I went to school. I even had a good scholarship. But of course I couldn't take advantage of that. I worked shitty jobs, and we bought a shitty house. Now here I am.

There's reasons for this post that I don't care to explain. But I don't know. I feel like I can't do anything to improve my life right now. My car has gone to the shit so even if I get a job, how will I get there? I don't know. I think I'm done trying."

Can anyone truly explain why it's worth living in a world where everything is so wrong and it seems like happiness is but a distant memory.

"Ready to Give UpHonestly, I don't believe I have been that much of a happy person, but over the last few months I've had an extremely hard time. I had my first relationship with a girl who i had been pursuing for 8 months last month and after about a week she started becoming extremely withdrawn. Eventually, she started making plans with me and blowing them off at the last minute to hang out with my roommates. We eventually broke up and now she is basically dating one of them. My situation is even more difficult because I'm at an internship 10+ hours away from home and have maybe one or two friends here who are nice but i don't know them well enough to talk to them.

 My history with girls has always been difficult. I have pursued two girls before this and each led me on for two years.They seemed to be interested in me but they never really were, and it was extremely painful to watch as they would pick piece of shit guys over me. It seems as if this is just going to be some continuous pattern where i try extremely hard to build a relationship with someone and they write me off when the next closest guy approaches them. 

I honestly have tried to make myself feel better but my efforts have been fruitless. My roommates continued to invite her over to our apartment for 2 weeks straight and they would just ignore my vomiting and crying that I was doing in my room. I have sought out a therapist but she frustrates me wanting to blame this on the fact that my parents would leave to go to their vacation home for 4 days a week and that I never had anyone around when i was over the age of 15.

I think about this situation constantly and it has completely consumed me. I relive every situation i have ever had with her trying to figure out what I have done wrong. Every girl loves to tell me that Im the nicest guy they've ever met but they then continue to lead me on and ultimately destroy me. I think about the 21 years I have lived so far and if I had to live them over again I would not. I honestly just want this to be over. I feel that if someone is to be happy they can't just go along with life learning to cope with problems, but eventually they must have something good happen to them. I feel like this will never happen for me. I'm extremely tired and ready to give up.

Thanks for reading. I'm trying to express the way I'm feeling and any comments, advice, and opinions will be extremely appreciated. Sorry for the terrible grammar, I'm not in a great state of mind.

Tge procedure is like that . I get a panic attack -&gt; get tested -&gt; get a negative -&gt; im calm for like a couple of days -&gt; getting panic attack -&gt; get tested

"Look forward to the endI want to write this down, I usually don't talk emotions out in the open. 
I've realised depression never leaves me. Then again  I could go months without feeling what I'm feeling now. I can feel happy for weeks and weeks, and then it just HITS me like a brick. the past few weeks though. that feeling has come back to bite me hard. I've lost my job because I couldn't handle it, I was having breakdowns. I'm ignoring messages from the few people who actually bother contacting me, i don't know why i do it. which is like, 2 people. i just can't get myself to reply to messages ever. so that's why I don't really have friends. I have zero contact with my family, i haven't spoken to any of them since 2015, I had abusive parents so I ran away from home soon after i turned 16. went to live with my then boyfriend. broke up with him last summer because he became a druggie who ended up abusing me emotionally and physically. So I left to live in a different town, got a job, started renting out a room in a shared house because i can't afford my own place. and at this moment in time, i want to just crumble in the corner and just fucking die. i feel like i'm ALWAYS saying the wrong things, upsetting people, i'm so angry. and it's not like i have anywhere to go, it's not like i have ANYWHERE. I don't even have a family, nothing. i have nothing. but to be honest, the fact that i don't have friends is all my fault. because i freak out when someone tries to get close to me. i freak. it's been a year since i've had a boyfriend. haven't even been on a date yet. i feel like i want to, but i also feel like i'm too tired for that shit. i can't be bothered to go on fucking dating sites. a cross or a tick? fuck that shit. one thing i guess i am ""blessed"" with is the fact that i'm 
attractive physically. I see guys checking me out every time i walk down the street, and i ignore them all, it's kind of like ""just leave me alone"". i was fine and happy this morning. i have a job interview/training day at a local bar tomorrow, just down the road. i've always wanted to do bar work so i'm looking forward to that i guess. but i'll probably fuck that up as well. i don't know man. i've just had enough."

"I finally found true happinessSo to put things in context i was always bullied through middle school which killed my ability to talk to people that I donât know. I hated myself and my own image. I constantly make self deprecating jokes about my appearance and people just agreed with it. In other words Iâm a lonely highschooler

Any ways, a couple days back I was really lonely and decided to join a teen dating discord because Iâm 16. I have no confidence in the real world to try to talk to other girls so I thought that because itâs through a screen I would have confidence. So I set up my introduction and waited for DMs.

Well none came so I decided that I would dm one of them to play games. So I found someone with similar interests and was in my age and grade so I dmed her. We kicked things off by playing gmod. As we were talking I made a fat joke about my self (which was the meme in my school that people used to call me fat and I made jokes about it) and she told me that Iâm not fat and that she can tell by my voice. It blew me back because I never had someone say that to me. 

I had to leave to go to something so I said that I had to dip and if she was down to play games and talk any other time. She said yes and before I left she said that I had a really nice voice and and that she liked it. I was completely blown back, it was the part of my body I hated the most. Everyone used to tell me to stop talking because it was annoying and a trash excuse of a voice. When the word went through my mind I felt such a surge of energy and motivation. I felt truly happy. It was something I havenât felt since I was like 7. I never had this feeling of happiness before so after I got off I almost started crying, no one has ever been this nice to me before. And I usually never cry, not trying to sound r/iamverybadass but to fix my middle school reputation I had to do things I shouldnât have done, earning me a sketchier reputation. So sharing or talking about my feelings wasnât on the table for me except now. And now I donât have cravings anymore which was weird but good, it was like it cleansed my body.

Itâs a feeling warmer then drugs and liquor"

"Does anyone else miss the magic?I feel like over the last few years the most common sensation I've experienced is this intense, brutal nostalgia. It keeps coming back. As I've moved on from my childhood home, family, and friends; got my own place and started my career, I've started to realize how empty life is and how lonely I'm destined to be. Everything is so dreadful, so bleak, so pointless. Life is a cycle of suffering, stress, existential crisis. Working just to pay the bills, living paycheck to paycheck, spending a few hours here and there with ""friends"" I don't even really care about. Over and over and over again for years. I feel like everything just gets darker and darker. Nothing excites me anymore.

 I just want to be a child again and to feel the magic I used to feel in the world - the magic of running through soccer fields with my friends, the magic of just walking through the mall and shooting the shit; or just watching the sunset outside my bedroom window and dreaming about girls and school and everything I was so hopeful about. The magic of doing push-ups in front of the mirror, feeling like I was going to be a badass. The magic of long car rides in the backseat of my parents' car, watching the roads fly by. The magic of feeling like there was so much to life - so much to experience. Nowadays I feel like everything I wanted has already passed me by. Adulthood is just a long spiral into decay and unhappiness and isolation. Maybe human beings are just meant to live a tiny part of their lives happy and hopeful; and then spend the rest of their lives desperately chasing that feeling.

There's nothing left. I'm so empty and so tired. Every day I feel further and further from any kind of hope. I want so badly to feel something as deeply as I did when I was a kid. But there's just this constant dullness. I'm starting to see the signs of age on my face. My hairline's receding and my skin's starting to wrinkle. I haven't talked to anyone in weeks. I'm unemployed, single for three years, and soon I'll probably be homeless. I've stopped eating and I've stopped sleeping well.

A few months ago I made the car trip up to my old town. My parents are long gone, as are all my friends; so there was no one to visit. But I walked all around my old house, and the old schoolyard; and the trails my friends and I used to bike around; and I got this pang in my heart so intense I wanted to burst. I want to die just because I don't want to live knowing I'll never have that magic again."
"First time considering in a long time, and the most seriouslyI don't even know where to start. Been the most depressed I've been in a while and maybe ever for more than a week now, been getting there for months. Crying all the time. Debt. Shitty job, can't catch up. My cat is really sick and I can't afford the vet bills. Car needs work. Living in a government supported apartment and feel worthless. Low self esteem, can feel eating disorder come back. Missed my wisdom tooth appointment and am constantly nauseous and uncomfortable. Haven't been able to sleep for months. Sleeping pills don't do much. Want to take all of them and slip away. Want to make sure someone will take care of the cat for me. Feel hopeless and giving up. I even scheduled an emergency therapy appointment but my therapist wasn't available. The person I got scheduled with told me I need to accept that my cat might not live very long. Told me my insecurity was going to drive my boyfriend away. Giving up."
"So let me tell you a story that happened on a public survival minecraft server So it was around 5 years ago and i went to my best friends house, and as always we fired up minecraft and went into a server, me and my friend used to live near each other but my home was a storage to keep our stuff, not really a home

and also we were the richest people in the server with the biggest house in thee whole server,

so the server is a non-pvp survival server, but i found a way to kill people , there was a glitch that allowed you to hurt players that teleport to you by request in the nether roof,

so i did the nether roof glitch and i got over the roof and i spammed the chat saying that i found something super amazing on the nether roof, so someone requests a teleport, and i accept.

since he had a bad internet connection it took a long time for him to load in, so we killed him

he had A LOT OF expensive stuff, a whole lot of goodies

and even un obtainable items in the game that you had to purchase with real money

so i took the stuff and teleported myself to home so he couldnt kill me when he used /back

so he started begging in the chat telling me to give his stuff back and ...

and we had a good reputation in the server and we didnt want to ruin it, so i said it was my cousins fault because he was playing at that moment (i was lying)

so i tell him to tp back to me so i can give his stuff back

(he was gearing up because he thought we were still on the nether roof)

but also i knew another glitch for killing players in the non pvp server too

if you are in a claimed by player section but you are trusted in that claimed section you can set fire to other players but they cant hurt or set fire to you,

so we all know what happens next,

i accept the teleport request and he tps into my friends house and since he has a bad internet connection we set fire to him,

and he was geared up with god level full diamond pack and a whole lot on music discs for some reason

music discs were really really expensive and hard to find and god level enchantments are bought using real money

so after killing him we quickly spam the chat saying that it was my other cousin that did that

and we quickly left the server, but he did alert the admins but the admins told him that its his fault and he shouldnt have done that

so here is the stuff i got by memory

\*249 Diamonds

\*320 Emeralds

\* A whole lot of very expensive discs

\*lottery cards (more on that later)

\*premium vote cards

\*576 cacti

\*Around 200 Diamond blocks

\*Three sets of god armor, half used and one brand new

\*64 Gold blocks

\*God level chest keys

\*leather armor

\*A whole lot of iron ore

\*God level enchantment books ( i think there were 7 of them )

\*128 Cooked beef

\*Instant health potion

\*\*A lottery card is a paid and one use item used in that server were you could win the lottery and get a lot of good stuff or outright lose your money

\*\*Vote cards and Vote keys do the same but you will 100% get something and they are more expensive and the highest level prize is worse compared to the lottery card

i have a lot more stories like this, if you are interested i will post more of these stories"
"Before doing this, I want to say goodbye and...
I love you, mom, you too, dad. Y'all were incredible parents and friends to me. Caroline, I know you will cry when you read this but hey, I'm now in a better place, right? You know I had no choice, I tried everything I could but it seemed useless, the disorder is growing up faster than I thought and it won't stop. My mind had betrayed me again. I really want to hurt nobody. It's doing it again, it tells me to kill people, do illegal acts, but no anymore....
I'm trash. For some time I thought I could go out there killing random people before shooting my head up. It was a horrendous twisted mind-set going on through, you know it baby, but now i won't do it.  nobody deserves to be killed by a stupid suicide dumbfuck for nothing. 
I would give EVERYTHING to be normal and live happy but can't, I'm mental illness and have no total control of my acts, its so sad one day I could care of everybody and smile and the next one think like a serial murder. 

I'm right now really under the thought that nobodie has to pay for my pain, but just me. Im the only person who can stop this

"My friend killed himselfWhat the fuck am I supposed to do? I'm baking cookie brownies for his family and I'm going to make art of him. But how am I supposed to feel? I cried a lot last night, and we weren't that close but I saw him every morning when we were in school. I gave him rides. We were friends. He was my friend. What the fuck could I have done? What can I do now? How am I supposed to deal with this?"
"Please live ! Your life has meaning.What makes life valuable is death, the fact that we people grow old and die is what makes life so precious.. so valuable. Growing and dying is what gives meaning and beauty to life, and to end that so early is a waste of life.. we all have potential and talents, the ability to grow . That is the superpower all us humans have, the ability to improve but itâs up to you to use your power, to reach your limit and to keep pushing and break those limits cause truly we have no limits to what we can and cannot do, you and me alike.


Suicide isnât the way out because theirs so much more to life than ending it early because if you live youâll end up reaching the end anyway, why not have a good time, some bad memories, some good memories but you live, you learn.. life is a rollercoaster and thatâs what makes it fun, itâs always something on the next chapter but you canât fear it because good or bad it builds you. We all lose people, we even lose our selves sometimes but that is life.. that is living. Winning and losing and sometimes it may feel like youâre only losing but if you change your environment, get your shit together.. and work towards a brighter future it will come.

Good things come to people who wait, amazing come to people who work for it. Live with your chest high, smile in the face of danger.. become greater than you were yesterday, you will fall, it will feel hopeless but if you continue to fight it will all be worth it but only if you put in the work.


Your life is worth something simply because you exist and simply because you have the power to change your life.. your life is worth living.. so many experiences youâll miss out on. Finally getting that job, graduating college or even high school.. holding your newborn child and feeling the warmth from your childâs body, meeting that boy or girl of your dreams, falling in love.. holding the most money youâve ever seen in your hand. Becoming a father or mother.. a uncle or auntie.


Push-forward, for the end is never . When death comes we are not, we are death is not.. why fear or rush something that does not exist ?"

"5 days off my antidepressants and I'm feeling suicidal againSo, long story short, I was dumped, forced to leave the state I was accustomed to so I can live in Michigan where I have no friends or family. I found a new job, but without health insurance, and ran out of my antidepressant of 5 years. It's crazy just how much you don't realize an antidepressant is helping, until you no longer have it. Now I have to apply for health insurance, somehow find a new psychiatrist, and convince them that I've already tried literally all of the SSRI's out there and found that only Wellbutrin works. I have to do all of these things while extremely depressed and borderline suicidal. I've even been eating healthier and exercising multiple times a week, and I don't drink/do drugs. I've considered drinking just to get me by until my health insurance kicks in/I get my meds, but that seems extremely self-destructive.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is coming off as whiny, but I have literally nowhere else to go. I just wanted to express how frustrated I am that all of this is happening within a span of less than a week. Does anybody have any advice? I know the obvious ""be patient"" applies, but I've been hospitalized for a suicide attempt in the past, and have spent the past 5 years seeing a therapist and psychiatrist to keep my depression at bay. All of that was ripped away from me in an instant, and I feel so lost. Thanks for reading my rant, I hope I'm not judged too harshly for complaining..."
"How do I prevent my idiotic self from hurting my grandmas feelings? My birthday is Jan. 3rd, right after Christmas so Iâm always a little dry with gift ideas when my grandparents ask me for a list or something of the sort. My grandma wants to get me gift cards and things like that but I feel like those gifts are sort of boring or not though out, but how do I tell her this without hurting her feelings? She can get pretty sensitive when it comes to gift giving and Is known to compare hers to my other grandparents gifts, so I donât want to hurt her feelings by passively insulting her gift idea, but I also feel like gift cards are boring gifts when I could ask for something else instead. Does anybody know some better phrasing then âgift cards seem kind of boring compared to other things I could ask forâ because that sounds like itâs not a good gift and I would feel like a POS for months to come."

"question regarding a girl sorry for the generic post people who sort by new. I like this girl and have pretty much since I met her and I told her when I did. She said she wasn't ready for a relationship, it's now 2 years later and she has been really flirty recently. It's really hard for me to read her when we are in person and even worse over text though so I could just be misreading. My thought was I could just confess but I also want to make it clear that if she says she doesn't like me back I would like to keep her as a friend (she's my best friend). I know the thing when you tell someone you like them and then are like ""it's ok though no pressure"" that it's kinda shit is there a better way to do it/should I do it at all?"

and it almost kissed you.
Now it's justifiable why everyone feels sorry for you.

Lockdown is shit I need someone to kill me...So I thought because of the lockdown now someone would text me or talk to me as they are bored but as it turns out no one wants me even when they have nothing to do no one even thought of me I feel like today maybe my end but I am way too much of a pussy to kill my self
"Itâs my birthday &amp; Iâm realizing where I stand.Itâs my Birthday today as of midnight EST. &amp; maybe itâs an overreaction but for my group of friends, we would stay up till midnight and wish them a happy birthday. 

I havenât gotten a single one. Which you know itâs 1 in the morning get some sleep you idiot but itâs been happening the past 3-4 years now. We have âplans to hang out tonightâ But honestly I just feel like staying inside drinking and overdosing on muscle relaxers.

I canât sleep, I have no appetite I feel like my life is stagnating and I have no way out like Iâm in quicksand and just watching myself drown. 

It really sucks to be the Person no one considers. 

Iâve suffered with anxiety and depression for over 20+ years + other mental illnesses and never felt comfortable with a counselor or a therapist.

It just feels like death would be the sweetest embrace Iâve felt in life ironically and the best way to change the cards I was dealt. 

I struggle so much with suicidal ideology and just the temptation that itâs not even a struggle anymore itâs more of a when are you gonna do it type of thing now.

This is a bunch of text dump.

Tl:Dr itâs my birthday people donât care about me. I see no point in living I have no future and want to die"

"My inner peace got murdered. Again.I found a little bit of my peace again and thought I could make it till my therapy starts and I'm hopefully in safe hands then. But this morning I found out about a 4 year old YouTube channel of mine with videos of me (MY FACE, MY VOICE , MY LOCATION). I was doing dumb shit, totally not funny. I read the comments and argued with people that called me names like cunt etc (ofc everything 4 years ago). But they were anonymous and I called them names with all my infos. It only has 3k views. Luckily. The problem is i dont know the email or password so I can never delete this. I'm starting to panic, I dont even want to go any more in Details whatelse I've done that time. I was an absolute Idiot, and also kind of an asshole tbh for getting angry that easy at people calling me names. I feel sick to my stomach rn. What if this catches up with me one day. I feel help/hopeless atm. The people that threatend me are 4 years older now as well but fuck what person was I. If you see that you would never believe that that Person is me, I changed grew up. I just want to press reset button. Everyday I discover new bullshit from my past. It adds up and up and up, hope I can accept my life is fucked one day and stop suffocating. Everything is alright isnt it nobody will kill me? My brain has fun torturing me with this making things 100x worse then they actually are. I hope this all gets forgetten, buried under tons of new vids uploaded to yt ervryday. I'm writing in this sub because in the past the best help came from here"

"I wrote a short story! What do you think?  

I drive home, the sun stinging my eyes as it sets. Iâm finally at my apartment, and I take the elevator up to the 6th floor. I grab my keys out of my pocket and fling the door open. Finally Iâm home. I put my key card back in my purse and I flop down on the couch. I can hear my roommate. I think sheâs taking a shower. I unravel my snowy cold scarf and peel my sweaty winter coat off. I go to switch on the tv, but notice the remote is all the way across the room. A little annoyed, I get up and grab it off the messy coffee table and sit back down in my chair.

Â Â Â Â Â Â  ââOh, youâre home, finally,ââ my roommate says. ââYou got home pretty late today.ââ

Â Â Â Â  ââYeah, it was a rough day today,ââ I respond. ââHere, I picked up the mail.ââ I hand her an Amazon box.

Â Â Â Â Â  ââIt finally got here!ââ she said, smiling.

Â Â Â Â Â  ââWhat is it?ââ I ask.

Â Â Â Â Â  ââSkin moisturizer. The special kind with sunscreen. Iâll need this for the beach tomorrow.ââ

Â Â Â Â Â  ââLucky you,ââ I joke. ââI have work on Monday. My job doesnât see it as a âholidayâ worthy of time off. Whatâs it like not having to work on Monday?ââ

Â Â Â Â  ââIt makes Tuesday suck!ââ She laughs.

Â Â Â Â  ââWhat do you want for supper?ââ I ask her.

Â Â Â Â  ââOoh, Iâve been craving Chik Fil A recently.ââ

Â Â Â Â  ââTheyâre closed today, silly. Canât you pick another day of the week?ââ I say, smiling.

Â Â Â Â  ââHmm, how about...ââ she pauses for a second. ââQuick! Turn on the tv! That new show is on!ââ She scrambles for the remote. ââItâs only on Friday nights!ââ

Â Â Â Â  ââThat dumb show? Whatever, Iâm ordering Chinese food.ââ I take out my phone. ââDo you want the shrimp one?ââ

Â Â Â Â  ââEw, no. I hate seafood.ââ She yells from the other room. ââHow about the chicken one?ââ

Â Â Â Â  I place an order and walk over to the kitchen. ââHey, you didnât take the trash out.ââ

Â Â Â Â  ââI donât have to. You do all the chores on Tuesdays.ââ she mumbles.

Â Â Â Â  ââYes, and you always take out the trash.ââ

Â Â Â  Â ââFine.ââ My roommate pauses the show, gets up and takes the trash out. While sheâs gone, the pizza finally gets here. The guy shows up and said, ââSorry Iâm late. I had trouble finding the house.ââ

Â Â Â Â  ââOh thatâs fine,ââ I tell him. ââItâs basically in the middle of nowhere anyway. So, what do I owe you?ââ

Â Â Â Â  ââUmm...ââ he glances at the receipt. ââÂ£7.46.ââ

Â Â Â Â  ââOkay, hold on.ââ I get my purse and hand him a 10. He hands me the pizza and my change, three dollars, a quarter, and two pennies. ââThank you!ââ

Â Â Â Â  I wake up my roommate. ââFoodâs here.ââ I whisper. She gets up from the couch, where she fell asleep watching that dumb show.

Â Â Â Â  When sheâs finally awake enough, she says, ââAw yes! Anchovies! My favorite!ââ

Â Â Â Â  ââYouâre gross. Iâm glad we got half of it pepperoni.ââ We laugh and enjoy our pizza.

Â Â Â Â  When the movie is over, we head to our rooms and fall asleep."

"Depressed and I Have To Interview For My Own Job In Two Weeks.I was diagnosed last May and currently on fluoxetine, and underwent some CBT therapy but have been referred for more intense treatment.

I have to interview for my own job in two weeks time as the company is restructuring, and although I should easily be the best fit, I have severe self doubt and I'm struggling to hold it together.

I've gained weight and honestly feel and look like shit. I'm married with two young children but it doesn't stop me wanting to commit suicide sometimes. I can't seem to get myself out of this rut."
"HS senior stressed out to this extentI honestly feel like a failure. UC applications are due tomorrow, and I submitted yesterday. But I messed up on listing my extracurriculars by saying the word ""I"" in every sentence before actually saying the activity. My grades don't do much for me either. The thing is, I applied to a bunch of colleges, and I feel like absolute crap. Like being compared to others in pools of applicants, feeling dumb and unintelligent, and feeling like I'm going nowhere fast. I just feel like dying; I cry at least nine times a week because I feel like a disservice to my parents and those around me. I just want to end it. Sometimes I picture my own obituary and wonder about the reactions of other people around me. When it gets really bad, I think about self harm--but when I do it, it's not on a large scale, just enough for me to feel something. I feel numbed. At the same time, this whole process of college is taking a toll on my self-esteem that might drive me to suicide, and I can't opt out given the 4k or more my parents have already spent trying to help me succeed even though I'm pretty sure I'll fail.

"It is very late for me so expect some spelling mistakes. (This story references the other 2 I have written, so spoilers i guess :/ .) The trench whistle called out in the night.

The Sergeant shouted at the men lined up by the walls.

They would soon go over the top, they would soon go running over a field of barbed wires, dead bodie and infront of the machineguns.

Jim was filled with andrenaline, this is what he had been waiting for. To finally get to fight and not just rot in a dirty trench for weeks and months.

''Lets go get those Germans!'' Jim shouted. 

The men that stood ready to charge responded with shouting ''Hussah'' the loudest they could.

But this bravery was mostly false save for a few like Jim.

Most were afraid, and who wouldn't be. They all knew that they were likely to be shot before they even get out of the trench.

And some few, were almost relieved. For years now they had been bleeding, starving and freezing on this place called ''The Western Front''. This place that never changed.

And now they were likely to finally be free from this place of suffering, from this place that was like frozen in time.

And even though all these different thoughts went through different peoples mind, it would not matter what they wanted to happen. Because if they reached the German trench, or got slaughtered on their way there was a thing no one could know.

But soon enough the call came, the whistles rang out, the men shouted.

And just like some had feared or hope, they fell in the first seconds. Others rushed straight towards the enemy trench, and among them ran Jim.

He didn't know why he was running, was it because he wanted to save the world? Was it because he wanted to be a hero? Or was he simply doing as everyone else did?

But he couldn't answer that question now, he did not have time to think about that now.

But then another whistling sound spread across the muddy and broken fields, a sound he knew well.

The sound of the artillery. And the look on everyones face was the same, it was a look of horror.

Even though some got used to hit, that was only in the relative safety of a trench. But out on a field, with machineguns, rifles and artillery all aiming directly at you it was different.

Some tried running, but even they fell. 

The feeling of pride had now left Jim

''What the fuck am I doing here'' He thought. ''I need to get away, now!''. But the amount of men behind him made it impossible to run back. All he could do was continue.

But the thing the frightened Jim the most wasn't the guns and firing. It was that he wasn't prepared for this, he always thought he would be brave when he had to go over the top. But he wasn't now, nobody was, and nobody would ever be.

Everyone tried to hide it, nobody wanted to be seen as weak. And this mentality of not showing weakness is what got them forward.

And when a bullet struck Jim it didn't matter how brave he had been in the trenches.

Because of his love for life and bravery, he couldn't accept the fact he had been shot.

He tried to get back up. But he couldn't.

''Please help me'' he cried. ''Please for the love of god don't leave me here''

But nobody heard him. 

He continued the cry for help, but the words never left his tongue.

He continued to to try and fight against death, but he couldn't.

''Is this how everyone feels when they die?'' Thought Jim, now having given up on trying to get help.

The answer to that is ''No'' everyone dealt with their last time differently.

Some people, like Mikhail died accepting that there was no point in trying to fight against it.

Others, like Sam. Died without ever getting the chance to think about it.

And some died like Jim. Trying to fight it.

But in the end, everyone dies.

Some dies at home in their beds, and others on a muddy field in France.

But everyone, no matter were they are from or what they believe in.

No matter what they have done, or what they have been through.

Finds eternal sleep, and with that eternal peace."
"Survived many attempts. Currently at a crossroadsSo Iâve struggled with being suicidal since I was 14. Iâve attempted many times some were stopped, others didnât work. I sunk into drug and alcohol addiction and many of my attempts involved being drunk or high. I recently lost one of my best friends (someone I loved dearly) to addiction. She was the only person I had met that understood me completely. The beginning of this year my friend from growing up tried to kill herself and told me when she was doing it. She didnât want me to save her saying âyou out of all people would understandâ and I did but I went and saved her anyways. Now sheâs still a depressed alcoholic and I have mixed feelings cause why the fuck did I save her just so she could continue to suffer, but I know it was the right thing to do. But anyways I tried to kill myself after that and failed, then a few weeks later my friend died of an OD. I tried to get sober after all that cause I realized if I continued my addiction I would die from either suicide or an od. I went to rehab and moved to live with my parents. Iâve been mostly sober (I smoke weed cause it helps with my suicidal thoughts, as Iâm not acting on them). But I just want to die. I feel like Iâve traumatized myself with all these attempts. I canât get past the thoughts that I donât want anything in this life. I just want to feel loved and I have felt loved in the past but it was never enough or is gone now. I know Iâm just rambling but I know I canât do this to the people that care about me. Iâve been on the other side of suicide and I know how shitty it is to lose people. But fuck why canât I just not always be in pain. I feel like I am waiting for someone to just kill me so itâs less painful on the people who care. Like I feel like going back to drugs so that maybe Iâll just die from that and itâll be less tragic. But thatâs so depressing. I want to be happy. I want to love and be loved back. I want to be strong. But thatâs just not my reality"
"Can I move out at 15? So, i'm not sure if this is where i should ask this, but i'm 15 and recently a lot of shit has been going down and my mum and dad got caught in a divorce, yadda yadda yadda, and i'm not in Utah and my mum is in Belize with her new boyfriend, i don't like being with my dad because he won't listen to me and refuses to take me to a doctor, i'll keep it as short as possible seeing as i only want an answer. 
I decided that i was going to move back in with my mum since my dad wouldn't listen to me and take me to a doctor to test me for COVID, i also have been wanting to see one for other reasons but my parents say i'm fine and won't listen to me, my mum agreed to let me live with my friend so i could go to a school where i know people, because i've been getting bad grades, my bad grades are because my mental health, you know the drill, and i'm getting them up, but it's kind of hard to when i can't exactly focus easily because of a mental disorder that i've wanted to get checked out so i can see if it's just me or if i need meds of some sort. I have terrible grades but my parents are neglectful and i have a friend who is willing to let me live with them, but a lot of people say i need to be 16 but i'm not sure if i can wait until 16 seeing as i've started to cut myself recently and have been slowly getting worse and worse. My mum also makes it hard for me to talk to my dad and adults because there's so much that i'm not sure that i can tell him, she got remarried without telling him, she owns a business and i'm pretty sure he doesn't know about, and i just need to get out of this house.
The friend that had agreed to let me live with them has told their parents about the situation and they are willing to give me a place to live and stuff.

TL;DR: Can i move away from my neglectful parents at 15 if i have a friend who knows about it and has parents who are willing to let me live with them?"

"Thinking about doing it.So, I'm 16 and living in Valdez Alaska. People who I become good friends with have a tendency to move away. I've never had a girlfriend, and I have no idea if I ever will.  I just feel so forever alone. People at school torment me for everything I do. The isolation of this town kills me. My life is so fucking tedious. Wake up, go to school, homework, practice, homework, reddit, bed. It never fucking changes. It doesn't help that my parents are pushing me to the limit. I get Bs, they want As. I get As, I better keep it that way. Both of them are super religious. I'm atheist, and I'm forced to go to church every Sunday and am getting confirmed against my will. My mom can't take the fact that her ""little boy"" has grown up and treats me like a goddamn toddler. Trying to convince her to see my point of view is no good. She just ""nopes"" anything I say and makes up her own words. 

Nobody has any idea how I feel on the inside. I'm stretched to my limits. People say it will get better. I've waited five years. Nothing's fucking changed. I still go to school with douche bags and girls who will never like me. I still endure endless fat jokes even though I've worked harder than any of those assholes. I just can't take it anymore. I've had enough with life. People tell me to wait, and that the best years of my life are ahead of me. Bullshit. I can't take two or more years of this garbage. Sometimes, I think about taking all the pills I can find in the medicine cabinet. Would it be like falling asleep? Do I have some kind of spirit? If so, where will it go? Hopefully somewhere that's better than this hellhole."

"Lose my kids or lose all my friends and communityFor the last 7 months, I've been prospecting for a motorcycle club, a support system for veterans who, like me struggle with mental health. It's hands down the best cultural fit for me. I don't fit in anywhere with normal people. Normal people are all like another culture where I don't belong.   
My kids mom and her family are terrified or COVID. She's said that either I cease all activities with the club, which would disqualify me from membership, or not be able to see my kids again until there is a vaccine.   
I'm starting to resent her and the club for their combined lack of flexibility and understanding. I want to leave it all."
"I just destroyed my own life in preparation to die. I'm terrified of deathMy first year at university was the best thing ever. I was able to be myself, a man. I presented male, I was addressed as such. Life was good. I had to go 'home' for the summer and since the day I started packing my dorm I've been more and more depressed. I was actually doing incredibly well at school, mentally speaking. Returning to this life has destroyed me. I'm in the South, 900+ miles from my few friends. I'm living a lie, my mom's hugely transphobic: I'm pretending to be a woman and somehow not crying every time I'm addressed by my deadname. But I can't do this. My job, my volunteering, adn my cat aren't enough to make me want to stay. I actually packed up and ran away last night, childish as it is.

I made it three hours before my mom caught me, dragged me back home sobbing. Now I can't leave the house without her permission.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm 20 years old, turning 21 in November, but I don't even want to see that birthday. I can't do this. I went from being able to cope pretty well with occasional bad days/weeks to every waking moment being awful, wanting nothing but to die or self-harm, and crying multiple times a day. 

Today I told members of my school's marching band that I'm quitting because I can't afford to come to all the pre-band camp rehearsals, which is true. 

I've proceeded to print out the sheet to drop out of my university and have it filled out. I just have to mail it. I'm terrified and sobbing but I don't know what else to do. I need to destroy my life. I need to destroy myself externally the way I've been destroyed internally in a matter of a week's time. I'm so scared."

Got drunk, way way too much. Had a panic attack in front of my friend who's never seen it before. Vomited on the floor. Got a new job and for some reason it's making me suicidal. State of the world is jacked up and makes me want to end it. I'm getting fat because food is the only thing that makes me better. At this point I'm wondering if I'll ever ever be content.

"A dear friend is almost constantly on the brink, and will only talk to me about it. Reddit, what do I do?!A good friend of mine has struggled his whole life with feeling inadequate. He doesn't have many friends, he has Asperger's Syndrome which makes it hard for him to interact with many people, especially the people around here. A few months ago he told me about his desire to end it. I was shocked, and talked him down from doing anything drastic at the time, but now he's starting to get worse again. I need help, he won't speak to anyone else about it, especially not his parents (he's Catholic, so suicide = hell). His biggest concern is that he doesn't fit in and doesn't have many friends, how can I show him there's more to live for? He's 17 and a junior in high school."
"Tomorrow is my birthdayIt really upsets me to think about it. I'm almost 20 and i live with my parents. That wouldn't be a problem if i actually contributed anything to their well-being, but i don't. All my online contacts hate me because they know how useless i am.

I was hospitalized and went inpatient a year ago. All i wanted to do was go inpatient so somebody could confirm something was wrong with me. Something is wrong with me. Quite a few things. Schizotypal personality, major depression/dysthymia and psychomotor issues, GAD, i'm codependent, i have no money and no friends, no car no job. I have migraines (cluster headaches but they're functionally the same thing) and neck pain, scoliosis. I have gender dysphoria too. I dissociate a lot and doubt myself. But then i go outside and realize i'm not normal.

I've tried and failed to get my hands on drugs. I wanted to try something medicinal and therapeutic, but never wanted ssris. Can't get weed. Alcohol only works in the moment. Wanted psychs or ket but can't get it. Therapists prescribed wellbutrin and citalopram. I don't know if wellbutrin worked because i took it slmost a year ago and my memory is bad. Didn't take citalopram. Took buspirone but it had too many side effects. Anyway, i was thinking about killing myself by spring. I'm not particularly worried about dying, but i know one of these days it'll be my fault when i don't wake up again. I guess i'm supposed to be sad but i don't feel anything right now except for an achy body, foggy mind and stinging eyes.

Anyways, i didn't even think about making a reddit account until i googled ""i don't care about success"" and ""i'm too far gone"" and found some posts from here. I don't know why i'm making this post. It's not gonna change anything to make a post on reddit."
"My study hall teacher sexual assaulted a kid I did not just find out it happen year ago but it just randomly came to my mind. So I was chilling and found out from word of mouth that my former study hall teacher was in to kids. Then thatâs all a heard that day, no one could stop making jokes and talking about to save there life. I was in His study class for like a 10th of the year because my math grades were taking a nose dive and my dumbass wanted to stay in. Heâs bail was set to $100,00 and is still in the pin and by the time he out Iâm gunna be a Adult."

"Debating if death, homelessness, or a terrible job is the best option.I went to school my whole life, got a couple of useless degrees, got out and unsurprisingly couldn't handle the real world.

I've been unemployed three years now and I've accepted a retail job. I used to have one, it was honestly soul crushing, so I know exactly how bad it'll be. I slept all the time I didn't work. There's no point to living like that. 

Since I'm actually a giant baby who can't handle basic shit, I've now got a few days to decide if dying is the best option. I'm probably just going to do it. I hate everything."
Guys what do you think about me when you see my post history What does my post history look like? Is it good or is it weird
"Sometimes I wonderI look at my life and sometimes things are good. But then I think about the reality, I'm a college drop out who couldn't even finish when it was paid for him in full by the university. I have no real drive or any idea where I'm going in life. I'm working a dead end job with no real means of moving up. My wife constantly asks for a divorce and in reality I'm too scared to let her go because if I do I will have nothing. I don't have a home to go back to, I don't have a car of my own anymore, I don't know what to do with my life. The sad part about it all is that I try my hardest to not fuck it all up but it still happens every time I look back. It's not my first time thinking like this, I contemplate the thought all the time. But then I worry about the burdens I would be leaving on family. The debt, the bills, everything and it makes me feel like such a bigger failure. I know I'm bipolar and this is just a bad low.. but at the same time I wonder about this all the time. Would anyone even miss me?"

Yes, taking my phone away will help me improve my studying. Yes, mom, when you yell i have big motivation to study.

The reason why i got a C is because last few days were literaly hell. Some family problems. And before school mom told me its okay whatever i get, she understands that i was too stressed. And now she is angry asf, she says i didnt study... i want to cry. 

Btw im a really good student, i dont have all straight A but i dont remember last time a got C. I am also good in chemistry and i love that subject but.. damn i made fking dumb mistakes. Im mad asf, i want to cry..

If anyone leaves a comment i will respond when i get my phone back or before mom arrives home. Thats it"
"I want to end it.I find myself in my bed at night alone, sad, and just angry at the world nearly every day. I want to end it, I don't have a future anyway at least even if I did I know I wouldn't even enjoy it.  Nothing in the world as a career or future I believe I could be content with.  All the bullshit that I go though each and every day seems pointless to me ""oh gotta write that essay for my class"" ""gotta clean the house so my mom wont throw me out again"" just the sickening thought of those things in the back of my mind and such a DEEP desire to do absolutely nothing not even move from my bed or do a damn thing is the only thing I want. And seeing as that is not humanly possible why not just end it.

I think about it all the time so why not. I would personally go with a pill cocktail or carbon monoxide in a garage or something just because Im a pussy when it comes to pain.  Ill think about how easy it would be for me to just walk to my car grab a hose and attach it to the exhaust and feed it in through the car window then just listen to my favorite music and just sleep. 

There's nothing I desire, I don't have any goals, there's nothing I want, nothing I know shows me a possible future. When people ask about what I plan to do when I am older I ALWAYS have to fashion some extravagant excuse because when I try to see a future for myself I literally see nothing. A blank slate. Its just hopeless

I don't do anything for myself. I go to college and I get good grades like 3.6gpa's and shit (just so my mom wont charge me rent, and the good grades just so she will keep help paying for school) I work full time at some crappy pizza parlor only to pay my bills to my mom and to buy school supplies or gas I don't buy much of anything else the rest just gets saved. Saved for nothing because there's nothing I even want to get despite having the money to.

And then I just get the thought in my head ""Why not just do it?"" sure I would upset all of the people around me something I strive to never do. But its my pointless life not there's. Iv'e had to endure through so much bullshit ranging from molestation, a parents divorce, alcoholism, drug addiction, self harm, etc (for some of those, years)

I just don't see much of a point as to why I really need to keep living, of course however I don't think I have the balls to go through with it...But it sure as hell would be nice."
"Just fucked up my whole life.Just turned 18 and got a great job - decided tonight that I'd try some graffiti on the top of a local school. Why not?

Ended up getting caught and charged with a felony. Guys, I don't know how to deal with this - I'm scared, and I don't think I can do this alone. That's it. One fucking mistake, and now I'm a felon.

I've struggled with thoughts of suicide in the past, but now there's nothing I want more than to just end my existence. Imagine it, seriously. All the stress you have? Gone. Everything? Gone.

Honestly, I have nothing to live for. I don't want to take this day by day. I don't even want to take it minute by minute, or second by second. I can't even start to describe my self-hatred right now.

**EDIT: After sleep and medication, I feel better and am nowhere near considering suicide. What I did last night was stupid, but after comfort from r/SuicideWatch and a couple hours to get my nerves settled - I feel confident enough to cope. Thanks everybody. I love you guys. **"
"I just want to be loved by her... I dont know why but even after 6 months in my basement she still doesnt love me...

Did i read the instructions wrong?"
"Need help NOW...So, I'm at a point in my life where suicide is an option now.  I just graduated college and had to move back in with my parents.  Stayed with my parents for two weeks, but the fighting got so bad that I stayed with an uncle for a week out of state.  Problem though is my uncle is super cheap and won't run the A/C, cook dinner, etc. so its miserable there to.  I just showed back up to my parents house, but fighting already started and can't stay here for another week.

I actually now have thought out how I'm going to kill myself.  I'm either shooting myself or taking tons of Tylenol.  

My only real option to getting a job super fast would be to join the military, but thanks to my decision to try to help myself transition out of my dysfunctional family and taking medication I can't join for another year (medication wasn't for suicidal things btw).

So, what I want is a way to prevent this.  I don't want responses of ""hope and change"", it will get better, or any other thing that is suppose to cheer me up.

I want solutions.  Solutions are the only way I will live.  All I want to do is move out west and get a job out there.  I was hoping to work in the customer service industry or management type job.  It's what I have experience in (customer service jobs) and it's all I can realistically get with my major (psychology and business minor).

Everyone in my family lives out east.  And I have been turned down multiple times by companies only for the fact that I don't live in the area.  I went to college out west and it was probably the only time in a while I was happy.  I loved the culture out there, the people, and I felt happy out there.  I hate the east and especially where I am right now (the southeast).

Again, if you can come up with realistic solutions to this (how can I move out west and get a job without knowing anyone out there to live with and no money for rent) than a response on that would be helpful.  If you can only say something like ""I'm going through something similar"" or ""cheer up"", then it might be best to not even respond.  Not to be rude, but if I get a bunch of responses like that, then I'm pretty sure there is no way of accomplishing the above and I may as well end it now.

**TL;DR:** Read the rant to know where I'm coming from first.  Other than that, I want to get a job and live out west.  Can't because I don't live out there and have no one to stay with out there (got turned down multiple times over this).  If you have ideas on how to accomplish the above, please help.  

**PS:** Sorry for the sloppy writing.  I'm just not exactly in the best of moods right now (as you can tell).

**PPS:**  I'm sorry for being extremely negative in my responses.  But unless I get some hard evidence its doable what is being suggested, I'm going to be skeptical.  I need to be, as this is my life (or what is left of it).

"canât do this anymorei donât know what to do anymore besides cry. i donât care about anything anymore. no matter what i do, my friends and family will somehow suck the life out of me. i cant be alive anymore. iâm not strong enough for this world."
"Do I just keep on pretending everything is okay?I don't get what's wrong with me. I have a great support system. I have loving and caring friends and family. I am a freshman at a University. I accomplished completing my very first semester. I can take care of myself of basic things. I see a therapist and a psychiatrist. 

But yet I feel alone and alienated. I get so frustrated that I feel depressed. I am bombarded with my dark thoughts. I don't see a future and I don't see myself getting old.  I'm not enjoying spending time with people and doing things that I used to love to do.

 I feel so angry that I can only displace my anger with physically hurting myself. I've stopped cutting since a month ago to appease others.  Last night, instead of cutting, I strangled myself with a belt. My vision was getting dim and fuzzy and I let go of my grasp before I blacked out. It was terrifying. The messed up thing is I wish I continued. 

I am feeling so distraught and stuck."
"who cares?if i killed myself right now, which i absolutely could, what would it matter? iâm a horrible mother and i deserve to die anyways. every morning i wake up and immediately cry that i have to do this shit all over again. i hate it. i hate everything!! i donât want to be here. i feel like my mental illness has won, iâm just a shell of the person i used to be. all i think about is dying and different ways of killing myself. i canât even think positive anymore. i want out."

I have tried again and again to end my life but for some reason I'm so fucking bad at it. I don't understand why it won't work. Is it my unconscious self stopping myself because me consciously right now wants to be dead? I have genuinely tried. Genuinely. Like really genuinely. Wrote the note, cried my fucking eyes out and tried to do it. I've tried to cut my wrists but I couldn't get it deep enough or in the right place. I've tried to to strangle myself again and again. I've even tried to hang myself but it just won't work. Why? I am so tired. Both physically and mentally. Good people die every day. People who want to live life and have dreams and here I am. Who wants to die but can't seem to die. I want to end my life. So why won't it work?"

"I dont see the point of living. I cant help anyone else or myselfI joined this place about 2 hours ago to try to help others, but reading their stories and not being able to offer more than a listening ear made me feel more helpless than ever.

It hurts to know the opposite gender will never take a second look at me. It hurts that I can't look in the mirror without disgust. It hurts that when I'm hurting I eat, and the eating only progresses my hurt. It hurts how much my family loves me, but will never know what this feels like. It hurts that I can't tell them without their religion coming to play. It hurts to know how unintelligent I am. It hurts how obvious it is. It hurts to know everyone has talents and skills, while I dont. It hurts that my only passion and reason for getting up, is something I will soon no longer be able to do. It hurts that my one passion is something Im not even good at. It hurts that my passion makes me angry enough to want to quit, but I can't. It hurts that I'm up this late looking for some place to express myself, because I can't anywhere else without judgement. It hurts knowing this is my life. It hurts to get up. It hurts to look for motivation to get up in the morning. It hurts to know, that people dont want to give me a second chance. It hurts that people only focus on my flaws. It hurts to know that Im weak. It hurts to know I'm the person who doesn't get invited places. It hurts to know I can't get help. It hurts that I've been raised to shun the way I feel, and now its come to haunt me. It hurts everywhere. It hurts all over. It hurts to know I can't stop it. It hurts to know that for years I've gone through this over and over but I still only find one solution. It hurts because this is the only solution I see. It hurts to write this, to express myself, the real me. It hurts to take off the happy, weird, quirky mask. It hurts knowing its just a rouse. It hurts knowing its not real. It hurts. and I only know one way to stop it."

I'm so tired of trying. I just want to disappear. But I don't want to hurt my family or friends if I do anything. I can't take it anymore. I know that other people are going through this and that I'm actually not alone but I can't help but feel isolated from the world. I really don't know what to do and I don't know who to tell because I always feel like I'm a burden and that I'm holding my friends and family back from living their lives.

I asked the universe to give me a sign and it showed me tonight that Iâm better off dead. I have 31 miles worth of gas on my car. Iâm about to do some good with it. Iâm going to speed as fast as I can over the railroads in my city and hopefully my life is gone tonight. Goodbye. This is hell. Humans are the real demons.

And it's not just that, everyone that I talk about politics with just starts screaming because of a single difference of opinion and I'm really sick of it. It's annoying, immature, and shitting on Trump doesn't make you special. It just makes you sound stupid, so knock it off. Also, if I hear one more person say that Trump's brother deserved to die I will run them over with an 18 wheeler."
"Very suicidal not sure what to doAlright, so Im 20 and I'm in my third year of university.I battled depression for the first two years of university to the point that I almost killed myself last year. For some reason, after that incident, I decided to turn my life around and change the things around me. I was suicidal for many reasons but it was mainly my poor grades and my lack of hope for the future. I really did turn myself around and vowed to never even think of suicide again.
But I find myself here again but this time for different reasons. Things aren't perfect but I have no reason to feel suicidal. I have friends (who I guess are close but I have major trust issues), my lovely parents, and a bright future (if I work hard this semester, I can go on exchange to Spain next semester amongst other things). Like I said though, things aren't perfect and I guess Im tired of trying to pretend they are, to myself. Ive always tried to let things slide by and remain happy because I didnt want to get into depression. Now I just see how meaningless life is and I have a long way to go to get to where I want and frankly Im just exhausted. Im privileged to have the things I do in life but I don't have it in me to continue to work hard and fight to get to where I want. Im not lazy. I will do what I have to do to get things done but I dont see the point in doing all these things when there is no meaning to any of this.
Im not sure why Im here. Im really calm, not scared about this situation."
"Highschool Study Group/Accountability Partners Hey all! I was wondering if anyone wanted to join a study/accountability group. I'm asking bc I suck at online school, and it's really hard to even start on schoolwork, especially if you're alone, and have ADHD, like me lol

I would either make one on Tumblr, or Discord, but not both. It depends on what the majority of y'all want. 

If anyone's interested then I'll link a poll.

Edit: realized I can't make a poll. 

So just tell me which platform you want me to make it on and I'll go with the majority 
:) 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!! 


P.S. if there's any college students here, you can definitely join if you want! I would really appreciate it if you could give some advice, or even tutor if you're interested!

Thanks!"

"I became violentI was pushed hard and I became violent. I punched my ex in the face twice and in the last instance she snapped her ACL. I ran away like a coward and am trying and failing to restart my life. My family has pumped the last of their resources into me, and I spent the last five days drinking getting ready to kill myself. I have been to rehab for alcohol 4 times, and been in a psych ward over 10 times. Iâve lost count. Iâm smart as fuck and nobody can reach me. I am fucking miserable. I have somehow managed not to kill anyone yet, but it feels like itâs only a matter of time. I need to kill myself before I hurt someone more than I already have."
"STUCKThe mere thought that suicide exists pissed me off. Not that I don't want to die, I do, but it shouldn't be so fucking hard. I read on here today a guy who has tried to off himself 10 times taking massive overdoses and still waking up. That terrifies me. I want the job done. Even a gun in the mouth isn't guaranteed (look it up, but we warned it's gross). Surviving is my biggest fear an only think keeping me alive. 

I have all the drugs they say you 'need' to OD. And alcohol is easy to get. I guess it's when I find the right cocktail. Til then i'm stuck. Stuck living when I want to be dead."

"F (27) Verbally Abusive Ex- and A Poorly timed ReboundI'm not entirely sure where to begin- only in that it's been almost 5 months since I broke up with my ex of 3 years. Throughout those 3 years he was verbally abusive- often yelling at me, telling me my thoughts made no sense and were stupid, and then often neglecting or abandoning when I need help. 

During those 3 years I had 2 miscarriages, my father passed away almost a year ago now, I had a cancer scare, and have been told it is likely I will not be able to have children. I've remained strong throughout these crises, but now it seems to be all coming to a head.

I broke up with my ex in October because I had enough with being forgotten and neglected. He was often flirting with another girl and spending a lot of time with her. When we broke up, I felt like it was only a matter of time before he started dating her- because of this, I made a dumb mistake and started dating one of my really good friends (whom I've known for about 4 years). He is absolutely fantastic and understanding, and yet I feel nothing. I am numb. I got accepted into graduate school, I've taken up about 5 different hobbies, and I've got to make some deeper connections with old friends and family. I'm also seeing a therapist. Nothing seems to be helping. 

I miss my ex desperately. I am moving out of my current apartment- and all of his old stuff (which I'm throwing out) has caused me to break down again and again. I don't really feel anything right now. I just want to escape all of this. I know time is supposed to help heal, but I've just been feeling trapped and alone. I've talked with friends and my current bf- nothing helps take away the pain I feel. I just feel like a fuck-up- like I lost all purpose in my life.

Please, just talk to me. "
To the people who vape: why do you do it? Iâm not talking about people who are trying to quit smoking because in that i case i know that vape has saved lives. Iâm talking to the people who brag about vaping.
"Iâm an intelligent person and I know how to escape my situation but I canât escape myself or the choices I make. I am my own worst enemy and thatâs why I pray for a brutal death to get back at myself.Sup guys. Iâm here right now because I just need to vent and commiserate.

Iâm 23M. Indian-American. Reasonably good looking, professionally successful, financially in good/bad shape (more on that later), socially in good/bad shape (ditto), have great family support, and in general am fairly privileged.

I despise myself though, and Iâm trapped in a bubble of horrible choices I repeatedly make for myself. I feel like Iâm being held hostage by myself and I donât know what to do anymore besides wish for death - and at that, a particularly brutal and violent one because I want to inflict as much damage on this âotherâ me that keeps me in a constant state of torment.

Mental illness-wise, I have bipolar disorder type 2 which I refuse to keep in check. 

Ok. Letâs begin.

My family is fantastic and supportive. As a member of a âmodel minorityâ with high standards, I destroyed school. I went to a T-10 Public School on a full scholarship on top of which I earned $70k in National Merit money. I got a solid degree, and am working at a highly prestigious innovation think tank for the largest payer in the nation (healthcare). I intend to pursue medical school after this and have been assured I will be a shoe-in at top programs. I live in a cool city. Iâm in shape, Iâm supposedly good-looking and attract a fair bit of attention. I have cool hobbies that people are often in awe of. I have great friends who add value to my life. Iâm intellectually curious and can hold a conversation with anyone about anything. I have good EQ and can navigate social situations well.

But I couldnât be more dissatisfied and frustrated with myself. My executive skills are absolute shite - I do everything by the seat of my pants and without planning or forethought which places me in bad situations. Most recently I missed a flight (I routinely miss flights) for a fun trip and missed half the trip on top of which I paid a rebooking fee. Iâm constantly falling behind at work, which is a fast-paced environment. Similarly, I earned a position with a high-impact research journal and was awaiting info from them but then just let it slide. Even though they forgot to reach out to me, I doubt theyâll want me back since I too didnât reach back out to them. Iâve previously been fired from a research lab because I was playing fast and loose (showing up late, leaving early, showing up in shorts, showing up high off my ass - being high or in shorts wasnât addressed but Iâm confiding that in you). Iâm burning through money like anything. I miss breakfast in the morning so I eat at Dunkin Donuts followed by lunch at Chipotle followed by a 2-3 course meal from a restaurant at dinner. On average Iâm spending $600-$800/month on food alone. Funnily enough: I swing back and forth between blowing money on food to not eating for an entire day or two straight (Iâve always had problems with eating - I find it infuriating that eating is necessary, takes time, and costs money. At the peak of my depression I lost 37lbs in 3 months). This means I canât keep an exercise routine going because I donât have energy (I love exercising but I donât have the discipline to maintain a routine longer than a week - in 5 years of weightlifting Iâve made little to no progress). I donât take my medication (lamictal and abilify) because in my head when I miss them Iâm like, well whatâs the fucking point now? So I keep missing it. Iâve been off for weeks now, before which I probably took it for a week or two, before which I missed it for a month straight. I barely go to my psychiatrist and therapy appointments even though I find them deeply beneficial because Iâm lazy, uncommitted, and because itâs hard with my work schedule. Oh, I havenât paid any of the medical bills Iâve gotten in the mail either. I get a speed trap ticket or red light ticket at least once a week, which contributes to burning through cash (my insurance rates have exploded because of two car accidents Iâve been in along with a slew of speeding tickets in which Iâve been pulled over). Iâve been masturbating for 9 years straight, at least once a day. This keeps my libido at nonexistent levels coupled with damage from SSRIâs that I took earlier. This makes me feel bad because I donât reciprocate the interest I receive and fuels the intimacy issues I already have from my first girlfriend cheating on me, from the repeated borderline sexual assault I suffered from a FWB, and long-standing insecurities about how as a minority guy Iâm hideous and have a small penis. I donât talk to my grandparents enough. The other day, without thinking at all, I burned $500 at a strip club when my account is already in dire straits (so - my parents are managing the 70k for me by investing it. I run my affairs on my salary, so at the moment my credit card bill is higher than whatâs in my checking account). My roommate left a few weeks ago, and while I shouldâve IMMEDIATELY or even proactively sought out someone to replace him, Iâve been sitting on my ass so Iâll just keep eating the entire rent check. Iâve made 0 friends in the new city Iâm in, where Iâve been since March. Part of that is that I got complacent with my roommate, who negatively impacted my psyche because he was a slob (Iâm a clean freak) who stayed at home. He got me into smoking cigarettes which I continue to smoke to this day (I started smoking around April/May - if I get lung cancer Iâm not getting treatment for it, Iâm committing suicide) despite HATING every aspect of it. They make me choke, they smell, and I hate myself right after. Thankfully I havenât smoked weed in about two weeks, but I have an addiction to marijuana. In college, from sophomore year to senior year I more or less smoked weed all day every day. At one point I bought $10,000 worth of weed with the intention to sell it through a network of dealers. Despite having strong social intuition and being able to flip a switch to become extroverted and hypersocial, Iâm deeply socially anxious. I lie a lot. On rare occasions I steal from stores (a single pen, and at most a $100 rug from Walmart). I usually barely sleep. Iâll make the choice to have back-to-back marathon masturbation sessions, or watch Netflix/Prime until 4-5AM and then pass out and get to work where Iâm hazy and drowsy the rest of the day.

I feel absolutely powerless. My life is objectively so good and so easy. But Iâm self-destructing and self-sabotaging at every step, so Iâm always in fear of how Iâm going to kick myself another rung down the ladder with a bad choice. This feeling of powerlessness is a function of *myself* because **Iâm** the one making decisions that Iâll suffer the consequences of.

This leads me to the last point of my title: Iâm constantly fantasizing about hanging myself from a power line, or slicing my forearms open or eating a shotgun blast or jumping into traffic. I want to go out with a bang in an immense way so that itâs a painful and magnificent death just as a fuck you to myself. I donât know why I care, but itâd be cool for my friends and family to see how much I hated myself. Maybe Iâm a fucking pussy for caring about that and not truly even worthy of making a post here since Iâm âfakeâ suicidal and want to make a spectacle of it.

Does anyone have any advice?

**TL;DR: Iâm a tyrant to myself and hold my life hostage through a never-ending stream of bad choices. I have no self-control, even though I know what *should* be done, so I canât actually correct my life. Perpetually in a state of hopelessness as I watch myself make bad decision after bad decision and basically self-destruct. As my moods change I become more or less resilient. Currently am suicidal.**"
"I'm a failure not sure what other options I have leftSo, like I said, I'm not really sure what options I have left but I'm at the lowest point in my life.

In the past few months, I've broken up with my girlfriend, gotten in a car accident and can't afford to get a new one, moved back in with my mom, have eroded my savings down to a bank account with $10 dollars left, have been getting harassed by credit cards, and have no faith left in myself.

The worst part?  I thought I was doing everything right!  I went to law school (accumulating $180K+ in debt in the process), and have been unemployed for almost a year now.  I've given up looking for work in law and have started applying to retail - but they won't even call me back.  Honestly, I've given up looking and have totally detached.  This isn't how things were supposed to shake out!  I was supposed to be successful!  Instead - I came out as a total failure.  Everyone has to see it in me - even though they don't care - I still feel like a figure of ridicule.  

Essentially, I don't know what to do and don't see any options.  I haven't killed myself only because I'm afraid I'd screw it up and end up burdening people more so by having to take care of me as a vegetable.  I really wish I had died in that accident - It would have just made things simpler.  I talked to my mom earlier today and told her that I wanted to end my life because I don't think I can deal with things anymore.  She told me to get out if I was serious and basically dared me to do it.  I really don't know what else to do. "

Hoping 2019 is betterI met a wonderful girl last fall who Iâve been dating since then.  Weâve been through a lot together including me leaving a job working out of state and moving back home with my mom for a couple months.  I finally got a new job working with her dad and it couldnât be worse.  The works much faster pace then Iâm used to and itâs so stressful.  Thereâs a lot of people and itâs just not at all what Iâm used to.  Well this coupled with the fact that I was told I wouldnât have her dads blessing has led me to some severe depression and anxiety.  If it wasnât for her and our 3 dogs back at my moms I really donât know that Iâd be alive.. I hate waking up every morning and going to a shit hole job I canât stand then having a panic attack thinking that I might get fired and her dad and her family is gonna disown her because I canât keep a job.  Theyâve already told her before they donât want us together if I canât keep this job and itâs so stressful.  Sheâs said before that sheâll stay with me if I do lose the job I just donât want to pull her from her family and I hate it

"I honestly don't know what I want to writeI don't know what I'm here to type/say exactly, so I'll just type whatever pops into my head as I go. Sorry if I'm all over the place with my thoughts.

  I been depressed for the past couple years and have stopped socializing with my old friends. I now only talk to my family members. I have a roommate I only say, at most, a few sentences to a week. Not because I don't like him, but because it just seems stupid to talk to anyone without a reason and just for the sake of making conversation.

  I'm studying a subject I hate in college. The only reason I'm pursuing this subject is because I'm pretty good at it, and compared to the other subjects I'm decent at, I hate this the least. And it's not only that I dislike taking this subject in college, from what I can tell and from what I've seen, I will hate it when I graduate and get a job. I hate myself, and from what I've learned about this subject, others that know who I am would think it's the perfect subject/work environment for me. There are things that I wish I had done in the past, but all I can do now is look back at the past and realize there is no changing it.

  Over the past few months especially, suicide has been creeping into my mind as an easy way to just give up on everything. It started out as just a thought in the back of my head that I could kill myself if everything became too much for me. Though, over the last couple weeks I have been looking into methods for killing myself and actually doing research. Even now I have a few dozen tabs open with various ways to kill myself. I've been using, my family and listening to music as the two reasons to keep living and not kill myself all this time. But music is somehow getting stale, and after that all I have is my family. I often cry myself to sleep because I want to kill myself so badly, but I know leaving my family with a corpse and a letter would break them. I realize that if I die I won't have to deal with any of my thoughts or problems anymore, but I know my family would do my suffering for me. I hate what I am and it feels like there is someone else in my body walking me around every day. Thanks to my parents I am living a life that anyone should love to live, and I can't even think of a life I would rather live, but I don't want to live this life.

  I always act like I'm fine because I don't want to be bothered. I've been having trouble even faking a smile lately and all I want to do is lie in bed. It's like my body is already giving up. All I do now is the bare minimum for the sake of avoiding attention. The one thing that scares me more than anything is a failed suicide attempt. I know I would get a ton of attention if I attempted and fail and someone found out, which is why if I try to kill myself I would make the chance of living 0%.

  I'm also scared because I know the longer I decide to live, the more people my death could effect. I don't see myself getting married and having any children in my future anymore because don't want to leave a responsibility like parenting behind when I kill myself, and the longer I stall, the more I think about killing myself.

  I don't know what I'm expecting posting my thoughts will do, but this is the first time I've expressed myself to anyone other than myself. This post looks long as fuck and I don't feel like proof reading so I guess I'll post as is."
Where can I kill myself so I wonât be foundIâve been thinking the best way to end it and not be seen as selfish by my family and friends is to kill myself somewhere I wonât be found. Iâm hoping to just be considered missing. I canât face the thought of anyone blaming themselves  or finding my death preventable. I know this isnât the perfect solution but I also am just getting tired of feeling this pain for over a decade that wonât go away.
"i tried and i can't try again16f- I attempted suicide on the 29th of May. I overdosed on my medication. This was my third or fourth attempt, i'm not sure. It's been a little over a month and I've had ups and downs but I've felt empty inside the whole time. 2 days after my attempt i gave my final exams for the 11th grade, I failed chemistry and did badly in everything else. I won't get into any colleges next year. I desperately, desperately don't want to be here. I won't attempt again because I can't do that to my mother. But I can barely function. I have been in a daze of sleeping and waking for 24 hours. I finally got up now because i have tutions for the next 4 hours. I know it sounds like i'm faking and not that depressed but i need help. i want to go to an inpatient treatment facility but i can't because i live in India and there aren't any good ones here. most hospitals don't have programs like this. I need to be somewhere else i feel terrible and i needed to get it out. my sister (21f) also has depression and i feel terrible for being this way because she's as sad as me but I don't know i want to leave i just i feel terrible and i want to leave i'm sorry"
"If it was going to get better, it would have by now.It didn't. I'm 30, I worked my ass off and it didn't. I just want it to end."
"I have issues with how I look to the point that it makes me suffer every day And I'm not like delusional people who are actually cute and think they're ugly, I'm genuinely absolutely hideous, to the point where ""beauty is subjective"" doesn't apply to me at all. Nobody can possibly think that I'm cute and that's a fact. 

Anyway, I haven't talked to anyone outside of my family for years and even have problems going out of my room to talk to my family because I hate how i look so bad. Which obviously means I don't have friends. And people claim ""friends shouldn't care about looks"" but then they're fucking skinny and perfect and everyone wants to instantly be their friend. And I was fat since I was a kid because my parents didn't care about my health, and nobody wanted to be my friend because why the fuck would they when they could have a skinny normal friend? It's just how the fucking world works.

And I'm not working on losing weight but I don't think being fat is the whole issue, my face and head shape is fucked and my body is fucked and I'm hopeless for anyone to ever date me. And it makes me want to kill myself because there's no point working to fix something that's impossible really, I don't think even expensive plastic surgery could fix me good enough. I was born to kill myself."
"Im getting suicidal thoughts Everywhere i look i see people talking about how furries are bad and how we should all die. Whenever im on the internet and people will tell me to kill myself and that im disgusting and it really gets to me. I just want to fucking end it, i cant stand being on this world. I get harassed and bullied too much. I donât know how to handle my life, its been going down hill for so long. (Sorry if my punctuation is bad im still learning)"
"My crush stopped paying any attention to me. Should I give up? I used to talk to my crush, who is my classmate a lot before we had holidays, she often laughed at my jokes and seemed to have fun around me. 
Now she just doesnât care, we have no interactions and she ignores me when Iâm saying  a joke or something.
She now talks to another guy, just like we used to, laughs at every single thing he says and stares at him all the time. 
It might me my fault too, before the holidays I talked to my close girl friend a lot right in front of my crush, but if she really liked me would she change her mind that fast?
I really canât stop thinking about this, I canât have any more fun now, just thinking about her makes me incredibly sad. 
I liked her in a year now so forgetting her wonât be so easy."
"My crush just told me that she think compatibility is the most important thing in a relationship. So i told her that she's right and no relationship would work without compatibility
 

Then she said that she's seen a lot of relationships without compatibility

So i asked her whether she was talking about her parents."
"Almost did it today. Stopped because I felt selfish, but still want to. Trapped. Angry. Gonna rant, maybe that will delay it more.The rush I felt when I realized I could do it was tremendous, almost an overwhelming joy. The fact that I could just get out so easily...I was going through the medicine cabinet trying to find something to overdose on. It's that easy. Cap off. Pills in the mouth. Swallow. Water, maybe juice because I like the taste. Then some waiting, then you're done. You sleep forever. So simple. No surprises.
 All I could find was aspirin and hydrocodone. The only thing, literally the only thing that stops me is guilt for the inconvenience of emotion and self-blame that other people would deliver upon themselves, like my family. They would blame themselves for my shortcomings, none of which are their fault. But their misunderstanding is the only reason I even consider stopping, but it's a damn strong stopper, bringing me to a screeching halt. But I hate living as this bastard that I am. Death would be of such relief. I could just never have to deal with anything ever again. Yeah, that's cowardly, but I'm a coward. What of it, I want to embrace it. I come here and post because I feel like maybe I should. Because that's what they say, they say ""Get help"". Maybe someone can talk to me.
 I couldn't think of anyone to text or call that I wouldn't be bothering, especially at 5 in the morning. Especially because people don't seem to take me seriously.
 Because complaining about this shit, about my life, just feels like I'm pining for attention. Or like I'm making a big deal out of nothing. Or feeling stupid and moronic because EVERYONE feels this way, EVERYONE fantasizes about their own death, it's oh so common. On the internet at least the people here come in because they want to hear about how awful you feel about yourself and tell you why you shouldn't feel that way. I feel like an ass the way I'm talking, but I'm just so angry at myself. I just want to let my nasty fucking self suffer by cutting off the life I don't deserve. Don't let me use up resources and air and things that other people need more than me. I have chosen to be a waste of life, and it's better that I get out quickly before I waste anymore upon the world. I distract myself from my thoughts by watching movies with a lot of sexual tension. Me? I'm kind of a slut, so I guess it makes me feel like I have something to relate to and laugh at and distract me instead of feeling like shit for all the other reasons I feel like shit. I pretend like I have a tough skin around a lot of people but the truth is I'm grossly sensitive and every criticizing word stings even when I know it's constructive and truthful. 
I could sit here and list all the various things I despise about me that I have struggled and failed to fix. For example, my enormous fucking ego that I hide by pretending to be humble all the time. Or the fact that I am lazier than anyone I know. Or that I'm completely average in basically everything I do, that in the things that I am ""good"" at, I haven't improved at in years and it's my own fault and I want to change it but fail to every day. I always need somebody holding my hand through everything I do, someone guiding me, and it's pathetic. Does it matter? Nope. Nobody in the fucking world will notice if I go away, on the grand scale I will be a blip, maybe I'll damage a couple people close to me but part of the reason I feel the way I do is because when I've tried to approach them they've failed me anyway. Or maybe I did it wrong. Maybe when I asked them for help I did it wrong. Maybe it was because I watered it down a little, to ease into it so they wouldn't think I was being melodramatic. I want my sinking ship to just ease into one final, sighing breath and plunge deeply into the ocean. A decrepit house collapsing with exhaustion, into the dust. Let me lay down my tired bones. I just want to disappear so badly. And I can't because it's inconvenient to other people. I'm so trapped. I want so badly to die and I can't because I don't want to hurt anyone, I just want to hurt myself. One of my friends committed suicide almost a year ago, and I saw how hard everyone took it even the people who didn't know him that well. I don't want anyone to care if I die because I don't deserve it, but they will anyway, and that's why it FUCKING SUCKS. Because I WANT TO FUCKING GET OUT AND I CAN'T BECAUSE I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO  SUFFER FROM IT EXCEPT FOR ME. FUCK. Fuck fuck fuck. I just want to do it. I just want to do it so badly and I keep stopping because people have money invested in me, maybe some feelings too, even if they don't know me but have convinced themselves they do. "

"I can't walk further, you have to leave me here.Hello SuicideWatch,

Here I am again.
I feel so dead and empty since years. Years that went by like there is no future, but only day after day.
I just try to live this life one more day every day. Can you relate to the feeling when the sun rises, and you know you 're still here. Every evening I hope I'll be somewhere else and someone else... i fucked up my school when I was younger and now I'm working for minimum wage as a slave. I mean I feel like I am a slave... i really hate my job. But i want to do something and don't want my family to think I am a failure.

I don't live for my own. I live to pretend for others I am a normal happy person, but right now I'm crying. I am a man. What is wrong with me... I have a breakdown... I WANT TO BREAK OUT BUT I CAN'T DO IT ALONE ... PLS is someone out there... someone help me... please... oh god why..."
"I don't have any rights, any control over my lifeI'm 13 years old and I have no control of anything. I might live in America which people call a free country but that's a joke. Because if you're not 18, you have no rights at all.

I'm a mtf transgender girl. And I'll never be able to act on it until I'm 18. And sadly, I'll never see 18. My parents force me to get monthly haircuts. They push Christianity on me and say that my thoughts are from the Devil.

I asked them if they would rather have a dead son or a living daughter. They replied by guilting me and calling me selfish. They said that if I killed myself I would go to hell. Well, I'm going to do it.

And I know my grave will have my birth name on it. But I'm tired of living and having no freedom whatsoever. So let this message show who I really am.

"Why is it so hard to get help?I've ultimately decided to struggle against committing suicide for my family's sake even if it's unfair to expect me to keep living it would stop a cycle of trauma that would be inevitable after my suicide. Problem is people suck and I'm convinced most are incapable of giving a single fuck. Hotlines? They're downright insulting. I'm from the US and they're honestly useless here. You'd be better off calling an ambulance yourself or going to the hospital. Speaking of hospitals... The ones where I live locally are a hazard to their mental patients and I'd have to move states if I wanted a ward stay that could at least provide basic things like clean clothes and warm showers.

Oh wait, I can't move because it's illegal to do so thanks to my disabilities. I'd have to convince my guardian otherwise who thinks there's nothing wrong with the wards in our area. Alright, fine, this makes things difficult but for a brief time I convinced myself I just had to be extra proactive with recovery so then I wouldn't have to depend on a ward. 

Of course, that bubble was popped after finding out what it actually takes to recover; which is finding meaning among a community. I can't make a meaningful relationship with a friend that doesn't feel one sided let alone the distant dream of not being alienated among fellow human beings. At this point it's like demanding the near impossible and I can only imagine how much worse it is for people who get denied healthcare coverage. I honestly should give up and try to make my death look like an accident instead of waiting until I have a complete mental breakdown."

"Can anyone help meHere it is, for the past year or so, I've seriously been considering killing myself. I haven't gotten as far as planning the actual event out, but it's always at the back of my mind. If you knew me in person, you'd never guess, I wear a great mask. It seems like no matter what I do, there's pain and sorrow involved. When I eat meat, I feel like a piece of shit for the fact that animals life was ended so it could be fed to an animal, me, that didn't even want to live in the first place. Or if my younger brother starts acting like a dick, and we get in a fight I feel bad immediately after because I think he might be mad at himself or feel bad about himself because of something I could have said. He could have just said the worst shit imaginable to me, but it wouldn't matter because I can take it, and I'd feel bad for just making him think I didn't love him. My life is in the constant state of me feeling bad for other people, and empty on the inside. I would love to kill myself in all honesty, but thinking about my family crying and them thinking it's their own fault is the only thing that's kept me from it. I feel like I need to get help soon or I might do it, and I was wondering what you all thought I could do. I have no one in real life to talk to, I'm the last person any of them would expect to kill themselves. My parents would start treating me like a cripple or something if I ever brought up anything of the sort, and I feel like I'm running out of options. I really think it might just be best for me to end it, but we'll see. I just want to know your thoughts on my situation, and what things I could do to get better. Thanks for you're help"

"Just a rant/life summary (suicidal thoughts)When I was about 11, I tried to kill myself (awful parents, awful house, awful third world country) and for that I was beaten up pretty bad by my dad. I'm now almost 17, and I see no point in life, and no reason to keep going on.
No one loves me, at all. Not at home, not in the world, and that will probably never change. 
I guess that being an artist, I was born with the predisposition to be sad. I feel (and know) that my art will never be good enough for anyone to pay me for it, and I cannot see myself doing anything else for a living. 
And now what? What's the point? To maybe go around and exist (because living is DEFINITELY not something I've experienced before) having a miserable routine in a job that I hate? Or to go and try to follow my dream and end up even more miserable for not being able to even give myself some sort of materialistic pleasure?

I just wanna die. I see no option. No perspective of future happiness. I've never felt that.
Happiness.
And I just can't do it anymore."

I've been feeling this way for a long time, and self isolation, courtesy of Corona, has made it ten times worse.

I think firearms are the most risky but also have the greatest chance of success; if I slip up even in the slightest Iâll be a vegetable but if I donât then mission accomplished - only catch is that itâll be messy but I guess it doesnât rlly matter.

"Bored to death, life is over-rated, suicidalJust spent 4 agonizing and boring hours and I kept thinking how life was over-rated, how life sucks and is boring most of the time, and how the negative aspects of life outweighed the positives. I was very miserable the whole time I was at work, and if I had an ""Easy Button"" - a button that I could press which would kill me instantly and painlessly, I would have pressed it with no hesitation. It's not like I had nothing to do with work: I was actually working too slowly and the work was piling up.

Came home and saw my dog just sitting there on the couch, not moving at all, business as usual. I love my dog more than anything in the world. Seeing this just made me more depressed and reinforced my belief in life being over-rated.

I'm not so bored now (browsing the web), but I would still hit that Easy Button if I could. I'd say right now I'm slightly bored, I could play some video games to entertain me, but I've got other shit to take care of.

The only real obstacle to me committing suicide right now is that I don't have the means to. I have some kitchen knives that I can use to slit my carotid artery but I'm too afraid of pain. I heard having your heart stop beating is a nice way to die, you just lose consciousness and eventually you're gone. Sounds nice to me."

"Life is a vicious circleYou know, there was this one moment, where I started to realize, how shitty my life was the last few months. As usual, love is part of this. There was this one girl, I loved her from November '16 until last month. I thought so, but I think the last 3 months have been ""wanna-be love"", because I don't have a person I can talk to everytime and about everything. I started chatting with another girl. It was different from the beginning. Girl A always tried to reject me as quick as possible while exploiting me in a few ways. Everytime I texted her, I got very short answers, if I got an answer at all. But now it was different. She always answered me no matter how long it would take, she was more friendly, it was like perfect. I felt like there was somebody caring about me. But there was a problem. Our current class will be split up next school year because we get into 11th grade (germany). And the moment I realized, that I probably will not see her often, showed me, how much I love her. And thats where it starts again. I love her, but she doesn't love me for sure. And thats where I start questioning again, why I am here. If this would be the only problem, I probably could handle it. But it isnt. I was on a class trip, and the day went back home, I was pretty happy to be at home again. But I expected too much. The first thing which happened when I got back home, was my mother complaining about me. Thats when I started crying. And I don't cry a lot, but I needed to cry. Because I felt like nobody cares about me, I'm just there to be exploited. I take my time for others, just to get really nothing back or just complains. And that hurt me. I started thinking about suicide already days before. And I know, I couldn't do it anyways, but I felt like it would be better to just end it here and now. But I can't just cut myself, neither to just distract myself nor to kill myself. And this would probably be the only possibility right now. And I don't want to leave her. I imagine so many life situations that would be so nice with her, but she already rejected me. I think she knows that I love her, but when I asked her whether she wants to do sth with me, she just answered maybe. MAYBE. FUCKING SAY NO. But I can't leave her anyways, I don't want her to feel like she would be responsible for my death. And thats the vicious circle I was talking about. Everything I do, would end up in another negative thing. I know that love can't and should'nt be forced, but she is the only thing that keeps me from finding a way to stop it here and now the least painful way. If you ever read this, Louisa, when I'm dead, I loved you."

"The surprising part is the staggering depth of pain a person can experience.Welp, I did it again. Once again I've managed to place myself squarely in a position or true, honest, complete solitude. Actual aloneness. It's something I've experienced before. I was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago, I don't have it any more but at the time my doctors told me I was going to die soon. I was only 17 and not emotionally ready for the diagnosis or the prognosis. In response I shut out the world and didn't speak to another human for over a year. It was horrific and traumatizing, I'd told myself I'd never let my self isolating tendencies get so bad again. That I'd never allow myself to be alone again. Turns out it's a bit unavoidable when you're a disgusting inept leech like me. I spent a year or so recently, holed up in my room working from home and doing some odd home repair type jobs for ends meet. the majority of my friends were online. I made a mistake then, because I met someone incredibly special and I learned what it's actually like to have someone close to you. I didn't grow up with a good family you can draw your own conclusions as to how bad it was and despite the fact that I was fully in my mid twenties by the time I met this person I'd really never experienced actual real closeness. Well I ruined that, and whatever other internet friends I had because, plainly, it was the internet and I'd found some prospects in real life.so I packed my bags and moved cross country with someone new only to find myself in an extremely emotionally abusive relationship that has now deadened into me not leaving because I've got nowhere to go and them not telling me to leave because I have no idea.  At first I was surprised but pretty resilient to them telling me they hated me, and to kill myself, and whatever other horrible thing they could think of. But it's worn me down and honestly they're not really wrong. They don't mean it fully I think, at least most of the time. I think it's a facade, something they think is mildly humorous that they use defensively to avoid ever having a genuine conversation.""edgy humor"" Which I suppose makes things simpler considering how self deluded they are about who I am and the things I do. Not to put too much emphasis on them, understand that they are only a tiny piece to a large picture. The reality is, I'm 26 now, I'm old, Ive got no friends or family, I've got no one and nothing, and I think I deserve it. I think considering this has been most of what I've experienced in my life, this solitude and lonesomeness coupled with the fact that I can't find regular work due to a huge collaiope of beurocratic bullshit that would make you suspect a government conspiracy against me makes me think that the only thing that's left to do is just kill myself. Even in the event I do manage to get work so I can afford to leave this place it's not like it would be better, I'd just be grinding my skin off bit by bit at the slave mills so I can afford to get into debt. It's hard to articulate how much it hurts and how little I can do about it. I just sit here as the days whiz by occasionally crying or punching a wall until.my knuckles bleed. For years I knew it would come to this but I can feel now that it's unavoidable. I really just have to kill myself so I can stop fucking up and stop hurting people and stop leeching and stop feeling this unimaginable void of pain drowning me every second of every day. I used to think I'd be a writer, I can conceive of great beauty and even when I was very young I enjoyed the process. That's gone now, I hope whoever finds the short stories and poetry I've written has heart enough to destroy them instead of parading them around as one last testament to the fact of my failure as a human. I'm sorry this is so rambling I'm just exhausted, I hate to complain about my life as though I have things any worse than anyone else. I don't want to feel sorry for myself and to a large extent I don't, but if I were to list all the things that fuck me up and detract from my ability to interact with other people properly it would be a long one. If my life is half way over, or nearly so, there's not enough time left to undo the damage I've done. It's over. I really just have to do this."

"It is all my fault snd I cant take anymoreEverything is my fault.  I was diagnosed with Crohns disease when I was a teen.  My husband knew I was sick when he married me.  The entire time we dated, I never had a flare.  So he knew I was sick, but had never seen it.  Fast forward 20 years of on and off flares and a very high risk pregnancy......our daughter is now a teen.  My Crohns has become so bad I cannot work.  I am to sick to work but not sick enough for disability.  The last two years my flares have been almost back to back.  The last month I have been hospitalized.  The worst was the ischemic stroke I suffered.  

My illness has vastly exceeded my FMLA so I have lost my employment.  This has caused us to lose our house and has forced us to move in with family.  I had several auto withdrawals set up when I was working.   I tried to put a stop pay on them but two still cleared causeing overdrafts.  My husband is so mad at me that he now isn't talking to me.  It may be better than him yelling at me but silence is also painful.  He maintains this silence even in front of our daughter.  He blames me for everything.  Not being able to pay our bills because I have not worked, to our losing the house, to our moving in with family, to the overdrafts.  All of this is my fault and he never misses an opportunity to tell me.  

I have a large life insurance policy......he would never have to worry about money.  He always said he would rather have me than the money.  Now he says nothing.  Maybe it is time to solve the problem of ""me"" permanently.  I have the means, I have the plan......I just don't know what I am supposed to do.    I don't know what the right thing is.  My death would probably be my fault too...."

"No shrinks can solve itPretty sure I'm just looking for advice right now. I'm 32 and got emotionally stunted at 15 due to a divorce. Not just a divorce but moved to a different country. As wussy as it sounds after I moved to the new place I got picked on due to my accent and now have no self esteem. I've seen shrinks over and over and over. I've given up on some and had some give up on me. One literary said on her paperwork ""I don't know"" and sent me to someone else in their office who said ""yea, it's chronic depression, she needs to read more."" 


With the many shrinks have been many drugs. Nothing has ever made me ""feel"" better. Both parents were drinkers, dad stopped before mom but lately I really don't want to. Hell I've been to a rehab place and caught a few of the speakers in a lie, challenged them and felt like I was given an A to get out of their hair. Kind of reminded me of school while I was there. Was always the smartest kid in class eventually got bored and dropped out. How stereo typical. 


So for the last 15 or so years I've been working in the IT world and hated damn near every second of it. When I wasn't working on computers I was working as a cook. It's the other thing I can do and make bills. Always told myself that I liked computers so always found myself on a help desk job. But that always reminded me of George Carlin's quote of ""think of the most normal person you know, now realize that half of the people are dumber than that."" 


Everything I've ever done has been half assed. Not intentionally but I really feel like that's the best I can do. Throw me into anything and I will excel at the basics. Intermediate and I'm ok. Just enough to be ok but I'm going to screw up. Everyone fails up to their level, and I'm average. Get pushed from there and I screw up and then run away. After years I realized that I don't want to cook or work in IT so after some thought I figured being a truck driver would be ideal. Always by myself. Minimal interaction with people. Good money. yea fucked that up too. 


So now I sit, jobless, drinking again, angry at myself again. I'm fairly certain this won't happen but really the thought has been rolling around for years. I can tell from my past that I know it's going to get worse before it gets better. Tonight thought I looked up a few different ways to make it happen. I'm a really wimp when it comes to pain so I know it'll be a gun or noose and I know where to acquire a gun and how to make a noose but really I'm so bloody lazy at the moment that a trip to home depot for 10' of rope makes me lay back on the couch and want to punch myself. Honestly think I'm just too lazy to kill myself. Although with the other option it'll be quicker than anyone can stop me. I don't own a gun even though I know a few gun collectors. 


So here I sit. A 12 pack gone. Can't say I'm giving up hope because I honestly don't feel like it's ever been there. There has to be something other then stagnation because I've heard it exists. Not really sure I believe it though. I'm quite sure everyone goes though life lieing to themselves. Not pissed off and/or depressed but I don't think anyone is really walking though bliss all the time. If no one is then in the long run what is the point? Kids? Don't want them. A legacy? Don't desire it. Entertainment? In a sick way (to some) that is what I'm looking for. Some people just want to watch the world burn? Sure. How crazy is that huh? Yea it's a stupid line from a movie but hell I haven't found joy from anything in the last 17 years so fuck it all, go on and screw up the planet with popping out your kids, draining the government, screwing the lower and middle class, fucking over the rest of the world, I'm going to sit back and chuckle in private while everyone kills each other only to hope that honestly I catch a stray bullet sometime. What has been pissing me off lately is the screwed up little race war bull shit. What a piss poor excuse to kill or be killed. 

I really do think when it comes to average, I'm that. When it comes to stereo typical, I'm that. Bell curve anything and I'm at the peak. And I don't think there's much of a point of anything anymore.


I'm going to go to bed now. When I wake up tomorrow I'm going to do more phone interviews and get denied a few more times. Then I'm going to think about applying for a job at wal mart or mc donalds and then I'm going to realize again that I still know people in the IT world that can get me a job there and give them a call. Then I'm going to get another case of beer and I'll check back in here before I need to go back to bed yet again. Then rinse and repeat. 

life is nothing but wake up, go to work, go home, go to bed, and then rinse and repeat and then you die. "

I'm about to pull my eff it card.My medication hasn't been working for a little while now and I've been feeling all over the place emotionally. Couple that with me being sexually assualted 3 weeks ago and you'll get why I'm feeling helpless. Oh what's more is that since I'm pre everything transgender mtf and don't have breasts the guy who pinned me down and forced his tongue in my mouth while he was groping me he won't be charged with anything serious. If they catch him. I can't get him out of my head nor that night. Why did it happen? I want the memories to stop. I already have ptsd from sexual abuse I received growing up and now this. Fantastic. If I just go back to partying and take oxycontin and mix it with alcohol like I did last time maybe I'll die. Since I've burned almost all of my bridges I won't have someone to call 911 to rescue me this time. I should stop listening to the voices in my head before they I end up dead. Shoot if I posted this on facebook I'd get no response because I was dubbed the drama queen after my last suicide attempt. Idk what I accpect to get from this I just needed to get this out because I'm feeling bad again.
"Iâm tired of feeling sadI just feel sad all the time. I refuse to act because i love my family and friends too much. But iâm really struggling to keep going. Every day i wake up and just think about it until i have to get up. Often i donât even get out of bed and just think about it all day wishing i could fall back asleep. Iâm missing classes and crying every day. How can i fix this when iâm not allowed to do something about it. My family couldnât handle it. I canât do this to them, right? I donât know what to do."
"Posting lyrics I like day 9 Wait right here  
I'll be back in the morning  
I know that I'm not that important to you  
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous  
So much more than perfect  
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it  
If you give me time, I could work on it  
Give me some time while I work on it

Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you  
The Earth's in rotation, you're waiting for me  
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist  
'Cause we only have one conversation a week  
That's why your friends always hatin' on me  
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself  
Matter of fact, I ain't ever asked no one for help  
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings

None of my exes is over Lil Peep  
Nobody flexin' as much as I be  
That's why she text me and tell me she love me  
She know that someday I'll be over the sea  
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed  
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me  
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me

I know that I'm nothing like someone the family want me to be  
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?  
Look at my face while you talkin' to me  
'Cause we only have one conversation a week  
Can I get one conversation at least?  
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach  
This music's the only thing keeping  
The peace when I'm fallin' to pieces

Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason  
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces  
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason"

"Lost hopeI donât think I can keep going anymore, I used to be really suicidal, but I thought this past year I was getting better, but it always just comes back, Iâd feel fine for a couple weeks then everythingâs awful again. Iâve been depressed and suicidal for years now and I donât know why I havenât killed myself yet. The thought of living another year or even another few months terrifies me, Iâm now 19 and I didnât think Iâd ever make it to 16, I donât know what to do. Iâm so so lost. Iâm meant to start uni in September, but Iâm the back of my head all I think is that I wonât be alive for that. And I feel so awful because I have an amazing boyfriend and fantastic friends, but I cant bring myself to tell them all this, they know a bit, but I could never just go to them and say Iâm planning to kill myself. I donât feel like Iâm alive, I canât comprehend that I actually exist, and that other people can see me and speak to me. I feel like Iâm living in a bubble, or through a video game. Iâm so cut off from everyone and everything, Iâm so uncomfortable. Things would be so much better for everyone if I wasnât alive anymore, itâs all Iâve wanted for 6 years, and itâs never going to change."

"Anyone know how to get cyanide pills?All I can think about lately is suiside, everyone in my life hates me. I overheard my family talking about how much they can't wait to get rid of me. My brother with anger issues has tried to kill me over and over again, yet he's still their favorite. I have no window because he threw a rock threw it. Then proceeded to try to bash my head in with the same rock. I want to tell the police but my family said they'd kick me onto the streets if I did. 

If I end up on the streets I'd be stuck, I have no money for an appartmeant. And my parents take all my money because ""I owe it to them for feeding me though out my childhood."" I have no car to sleep in. I have no friends to take me in either. 

I feel like the only escape is suiside. Apperently cyanide is painless, and extremely effective. It seems like an easier way out them living like this. "

"Why my life sucks So I have this friend who I was really good friends with. She was one of my closest friends last year, and even though we had a few issues in the beginning I really cared about her. About 2 weeks before COVID and quarantine I started to have feelings for her, and I asked her out. She the proceeded to say âI donât knowâ and âI need timeâ for a month and a half. During that time our friendship became strained and awkward, and I straight up hit on her at times which made her uncomfortable. And eventually she finally said straight up no. After leading me on for a month and a half. After that there was a while where we didnât really talk to each other, but at the beginning of the school year this year we started taking again. Then like two months ago she started avoiding me and not answering my texts. I confronted her about it and we fought for awhile and we told each other how the we had each hurt each other and we apologized and agreed to give each other a month of space before resuming our friendship. I assumed we were all good now. I gave her the month, then I texted her, âhey itâs been a month. are we ok now?â She read my text and didnât answer. So I gave her a few more days. She still wouldnât talk to me. I texted her again only this time she had blocked me. I tried to talk to her and she kept avoiding me. I finally asked one of our mutual friends to tell her to talk to me and she told my friend, âew effff noâ. And now Iâm deeply hurt because one of my best friends just abandoned me because I liked her and she dragged it out and made me think I had a chance with her."

I 16m contemplated suicide since the age of 13 but itâs at its peak nowI stress over everything of life I told my parents almost 2 years ago that I was going to kill myself they acted liked they care but than the next day everything was okay I think they just thought I did that to not go to school the next day but I was seriously about jumped head first out of that window than I talk about to my dad a lot never takes me serious.My stress is terrible itâs not even worth living anymore know one would even fucking care if I was dead Thinking of killing myself tonight.
"the fact that two years later i see another 14 yr old girl on this sub sexualizing herself and acting horny when two years ago i was the same fucking thing... and i advised her to stop and just enjoy being a kid, and she was essentially like âfuck off mom iâll do what i wantâ

iâm 16 and I wish i was still 14 and didnât have to worry about so much now. i have an old account that was similar to herâs and it disappoints me that she doesnât listen just like I didnât listen to other people. and as someone who was like her, i know she gets horny dms and i know she entertains them, why else would she be posting about lewd shit. why else would a 14 yr old girl have an nsfw account??

Iâm 99.9% sure that they view me as a burden and that they want me gone so they can live their lives without me. I canât believe Iâm saying this because my family are the people that I have turned to in recent years for help and Iâve spent a lot of quality time with them. It has helped me a lot and is probably the reason that I am still alive today, but I guess I was wrong. I guess they just want me gone. I just need to stop being a wimp and do it already. Itâs basically been made clear that itâs my time since my family (the last people I have left) are giving up on me."

"My girlfriend of 3 years left me, please helpI'm sorry if this seems disjointed, or even overly calm, I don't know how I should be feeling at the moment, the only thing I know is that if I threw myself in front of a train this pain would stop for good.

She left me about a fortnight ago, and i've taken it fairly well up until now. She kept saying she still wants to be my friend, and that she still cares about me, that I still have a place in her heart, but actions speak louder than words and she ignores me when I need to talk to her the most, holds the smallest of things against me, and is generally making me feel worthless/like she wants me dead.

what makes it worse is that I've always tried to give her the best of everything, and being with her was the only thing I looked forward to at the end of the day. I no longer speak to my family for personal reasons and have no friends where I currently live, and i'm not able to move anywhere else due to a lack of funds. I literally tried to give her the world, before I lost my job I was saving up and was going to surprise her for her birthday in 2 years, letting her choose where on earth she wanted to go, and for how long.

Now I just feel like I'm falling with nothing to grab on to, I can't take pleasure from even the smallest of things like playing a video game over the net with a few guys I know (once again, met over the net) because my thoughts always go back to her and her beautiful smile.

I can't see any reason to go on when the only reason I truly care about doesn't care about me anymore, please, just give me something to look forward to, something to change my mind before I do something stupid, because it seems like it's the only way I won't feel like I've been poisoned from the inside at the moment.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your support, it's still going to be hard but from what you've all said taking some time for myself is definitely the best idea at the moment. In answer to one of the questions, I do contact juggling (I believe you call them Fugashi balls in America) and I'm learning a few card tricks, so I have something to keep myself occupied.

again, thank you all."

"Iâm a dick and drunk!I really fucked up. I was having a good time with someone - someone who I enjoyed chatting with  but I messed up. 

I was supposed to be spending time with them, but I got drunk. I didnât realise my being drunk would upset them, but I should of. Anyone who was sober would have realised. Who the fuck wants to listen to some fucking drunk, rambling on? I just didnât think and totally pissed them off. 

Iâm trying to balance so many balls, but what I failed to realise was that all the balls are already on the floor - Iâm just pretending that Iâm still keeping everything in the air. Iâm faking it so well I even began believing the lie. 

The thing is, this person, for a brief moment when we chatted, I completely forgot about the balls. It didnât matter where they were. I was lost in the moment but tonight I failed. Being drunk ruined everything. 

Now Iâm not writing this post for sympathy, to make them feel guilty, or as some kind of - itâs not my fault please forgive me crap. My actions are my own, no one elseâs. I just want them to know that appreciated the time I spent with them. That for the short time we spoke, they made a difference, and that I truly appreciated their presence - however short and random it may have been. 

Thing is, this isnât the first time something like this has happened. The common denominator?Me. There is no easy fix. If my attempt had worked a few days ago, then this wouldnât have happened. I would have been forgotten like a dream. I wouldnât have known their disappointment. 

There are a few things I know for certain -
1. I wrote this for myself. Iâm not looking for forgiveness. In fact, I hope they never find and read this. They donât need to. 
2. Iâm a dick. A complete arsehole. 
3. This world is better without me. 

I will fix this. I will erase my presence. I will make everything right. "

"I am afraid of my future lifeI am afraid that I'm going to end up living a shit life with not a lot of good friends or wife. All I ever wanted was to become a professional athlete. I train MMA and it seems like it is a tough road. I am 20 years old and I did not graduate highschool because I was in a lot of trouble with criminal adults. I even got good grades the first year before I got into trouble but my absent became too high. I have always had high ambitions for my life, if I can't get a good degree or live through sports I feel like I don't want to do anything. Right now I am looking for a job with night shifts so I can move to my own place and live my own life. I think If I don't become succesfull in MMA I am going to live a shitty lonely unmotivated life, where the only joy would come from working out. I don't even want to find a girlfriend because I wanted to be with someone from university and I feel too old to pursue that now as I don't even have a highschool degree. I wish the worst for the criminals that dragged me down that road and they began using me for criminal activities when I was 13 and they were 18+ I have never had good friend or a good life since I was 13.

"I like her so much but she hates me Since last year I've had a crush on this girl in the grade above me. A few days before the covid lock-down (it might have actually been the day before) I found her snapchat on snapchat. Since then I've been trying to hang out or play a videogame with her. She always said she was busy when I asked to hang out but seemed willing to play something but we have different consoles and most games she had weren't cross-play. Our friendship peeked in September when we were on the same minecraft server that my friend made and we were actually having long lasting conversations but then in October she started dry texting me and then ghosted me a week into November. I ended up creating a second account just to see if she was doing it to everyone or just me (in hindsight I realize that I probably shouldn't have done this). She responded to my second account and I responded with, ""thanks, that's everything I need to know"". She took a screen shot and sent it to me to ask if it was me, I denied it. She stopped ghosting me but was dry texting. In January she agreed to play a videogame with me multiple times but always gave a reason as to why she couldn't the day of. Now I'm trying not to text her but it's so difficult because she's so pretty and I don't even care if we date, I just want to at least be friends.   I want to text her but I know it will be bad for my mental health if I do. She probably hates me. 

Tl;dr I've spent like 11 months trying to build a friendship with a girl I like and I'm pretty sure she hates me"

He was good at football and loved it with a passion and i just got into football. I constantly was hoping to meet him and tell him how my team was undefeated. 

I play center and he did too.

I knew he would be proud. Although i never really knew him, i really wanted to know him. We were both fans of football and i knew we could talk about so much if we knew eachother. 

It pains me to know i couldnt tell him i wanted to play college football just like he did

But he was 95 and he was ready to see his wife

I'm already 1-2 years older than everyone in my class already due to the switch from American schools to Canadian. I'm 14 and from what others tell me I'm not an easy sight. I cant be held back it would just ruin to much. It isnt just school thats made me make this decision, its been building up for a while. My mom wasnt with my dad when I was born in Rhode Island, I've never met him and for all I know he's face down in a gutter. At some point my mom moved away from my grandparents house (who she always bitches about) and began living with a man named Kevin. Kevin was a pot dealer and violent. We were living in Colorado for a while, then the police busted down the door, a little while later I was on all the front pages of Leadville Colorado, my mom moved away with me while he was on parole, we were to meet up with him at a later date. Now living in California we settled in Somes Bar California, after a brief stint of my mom attempting to keep contact with Kevin while he was in federal prison in LA we moved around between Hoopa, willow creek, and happy camp (real place). at some point we went to the coast (eureka) and my mom then told me we had no where else to go but the streets. I ate in a soup kitchen and slept in a hippies van. We moved in with Bob a fat ass and his homosexual companion (also a fat ass), I was molested by Bob, my mom pushed no charges and instead moved out, he never even was reported. We finally had a stable house when we moved in with Kathie a nice person who owned a huge home with a bed and breakfast. We got her 4th house and my mom did maintenance, it was one room not including the one bathroom. My sister was born then and I slept on the couch every night when I was about 8. She met Ian a 20 year old Canadian college student who was hitchhiking. Skip forward a little while and my mom is telling me that she's only marring him to get to Canada (at this point Kevin is out of jail and after us). My mom tells me everyday that its my fault she has to have a fake marriage because I didn't like her being involved with drug dealers. Living in Canada, our landlord is a greedy asshole. We live in a 5 room house. We get kicked out half way through winter and end up in a 3 room basement apartment. Over the years we slowly got better, we now have the whole 2 stories and 9 rooms. But our landlord wants to sell and we cant afford it. We have to move out in the middle of winter during Christmas. The only social life I have is lying to people here in the wealthy city of Calgary. I tell me ""friends"" that I own an Xbox, and my computer is good (its really bad) and have all of the never ending stream of video games they have. I bullshit my way through everyday, all activities people my age find enjoyable aren't fun for me (I lose the will and boner long before orgasm) and pretty much stay inside most of the time. I have no extra activities and all the girls in my school are super rude to me. I get bad grades even though I try my best. I lie to myself and those around me. If I don't get at least an 80% in all it will be the final straw and I will do it. Whats kept me from doing it in the past was the fear of how it would affect my sister. She told me recently that she only cares about me enough as to how many gifts I can get her. I'm sorry if I've wasted your time but I just want to get it out so I have less baggage to deal with now. I'm not sure if you want proof but I'm sure I could find something if thats an issue. No tl;dr I cant sum up my problems that easy. I'm most likely going to delete this post either at the end of today or tomorrow. "

"My daily life #19 Today day was absolutely hillarious

My best friends finally came to school (only for this day) . We enjoyed every second of our meetup. In science lab , we did practicals on ammeter and voltmeter. I and my friends did something else. We created sparks of electricity with it and burn the nichrome wire.  Couldn't stop my laugh for an entire minute. After I came home I went to sleep and ate my dinner . And here I am at 2A.M. writing this.

Hope you have a good day/night"
Iâm tired of this worldI find meaning then i lose it. I find something to enjoy then it goes away. I say ok now Iâm comfortable with myself and find âMeâ then something destroys it. I try to communicate it then it gets muddy again. What is it with this world? Iâve been experiencing this since i was 18 now Iâm 27 and still feel it. I find love after so fucking years and lose it in a heartbeat. Every since I understood that circle I decided Iâm too tired to live like this but i was afraid to hurt my family and my mum. I donât anymore. Iâm afraid. Not doing it and coming here and talking to strangers kinda helps. Does this circles break at some point or does it keep going? Iâm really tired.

"I'm a Terrible PersonI have dealt with depression and thoughts of suicide for over 15 years now. I have self harmed but never made a real attempt at suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm struggling today though, and everything that's wrong is due to my own hand. I feel like a terrible person and wish I just didn't exist so I wouldn't hurt the people I care about. I don't have many friends and have made many of the friends I've had online. I've also been married for 5 years now. I love my husband but he doesn't suffer from mental illness and doesn't understand that some days I will just feel bad for no reason that I can pinpoint. He gets upset when I have days that I feel sad so I try to hide it. It makes me feel guilty. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although I've been talking to one of my online friends for over a year now, I've recently become much closer to them. This is in part because I don't feel guilty for confiding in them when I'm having an off day. They made plans to come out to where I live and hang out for a few days. I let my husband know this weeks ago and he was fine with it until today. The other day my friend bought the plane tickets and now suddenly my husband is not okay with me being friends with him. I love my husband very much but it feels like whenever I make a new friend, he does not approve of them. Today he told me he would never put me in the position I'm putting him in and it's making me feel like a terrible person. He never voiced his concerns before and I thought everything was fine, but now he says it's fishy. It seems like either way this situation plays out, I'm going to hurt somebody I very much care for. It makes me wish I could just disappear. I feel like the worst person in the world for it. I don't want to kill myself per se, but wouldn't mind if something happened that made it so I wouldn't have to deal with this situation which I see no win for. I honestly wish for some freak accident to occur so I don't have to hurt the people I love anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I may be overreacting but this situation truly is killing me."
"Rant about my schoolâs new grading system. So all of the schools in my district have adopted a new grading system.  The lowest grade you can get is DNM, or Does Not Meet. Above that is a P, or Partial. Above P is M for Meets, and then E for exceeds. When I first saw this, it made sense. But the teachers at my high-school have changes into this weird individual-based grading system. Basically, they decided that Meet didnât mean that you met the standard, but met their expectation of you. That means that if a teacher thinks that you will exceed on a standard, you will get an M if you do exceed. This essentially penalizes you for consistently doing well, and rewarding you for doing bad most of the time, but doing well occasionally. Because of this new system, I canât get an E grade anymore because thatâs what the teacher expects of me. Now, since no human can keep up with doing significantly more work than required for more than a few months, I have become burned out.  I canât constantly exceed, so now Iâm getting partial grades for meeting the standard, while other students are getting exceed grades for doing barely anything, because they donât do good all of the time.

And thatâs the end of the rant. I just needed to get that off of my chest."
"Day 4 of keeping an online journal I was very depressed so I skipped school and stayed in my room in the dark until my mom yelled at me to do chores and once I was done I went back to laying in bed wishing I wasn't ever born until my mom came back and yelled at me more

I had a dream the night before where me and my brother in law were a lets-play channel on youtube kinda like gamegrumps and we were doing a live show and interacting with the audience but there was this one guy who was very keen on touching me at first it was like a pat on the back and then we was holding my hips and it escalated to him basically groping me and even though I said multiple times to stop he didn't eventually my brother in law noticed and told him to stop and the guy kinda just went back to holding my hips and so my brother in law told him to stop more sternly and the guy backed off and was kinda pissed

I looked behind me seeing most of the crowd and the creepy dude retreating to his seat he was an overweight man with light acne and a beard with brown hair and he was wearing a navy blue shirt with vertical thin white stripes

"I think my birthday must be the worst day of the yearIt's not the fact that I'm by myself, that's been like that for most of my life and I'm already used to it. It just remind me that years ago this big useless mistake was brought into the world. It reminds me of how I fail to accomplish every little thing I tried to achieve. And when I tell my mother I just don't want to celebrate it and just spent it as a regular day,l and don't want any gifts, she gets mad at me and calls me ungrateful. I just want to stay all day in bed and cry myself to sleep until this awful day is over. Anyone else who just can't stand their birthday?"
"Things Didn't Get BetterI posted here back in 2015 or 2016. At the time I was living in old trailer in the woods without plumbing or electricity. My only help and transportation to get food or showers was an abusive family member. I'd pinned everything on getting my driver's license and being able to get a job and then improve my life. 


I of course failed the driver's exam and was banned from further attempts since my state doesn't allow more than 3 attempts.


Today nothing has changed much. I have a job I love but it doesn't pay much but I still can't drive and am helpless and dependent on an abusive relative. They verbally rip me apart and destroy my things. When I stil had to physically go into work they would threaten to withold rides from me, and now that I work from home because of the pandemic, they will make louds calls talking about slurs and rape and things when I'm supposed to be taking calls from customers.


Nothing has changed or gotten better. I'm still helpless and abused. I actually developed a brain mass that damaged my vision. I have carpal tunnel or arthritis and have lost all my hobbies (drawing, gaming) as a result. My abusive relative wastes the money I earn--I pay all our bills, they don't work. My brother, the person I loved most in the world, killed himself a year and a half ago. I feel like it's just an inevitability before the abuse drives me to do the same. 

I did manage to live on my own for a year and a half. And I never managed to make friends, except for one person who would not openly be my friend because ""my ex will think we're sleeping together"". What does it say about me that the only person who would willingly be around me will only do so in secret?

I just cant believe how helpless and easily controlled not being able to drive makes you, and there's basically no one way out if you don't have a supportive family or friends to loan you a car and help you practice. Society doesn't care at all that it's basically condemned people to die or live as helpless victims their entire lives. 

I hate this. And I see no way out."
"It's when I'm not depressed that I worry myself the most.The last few weeks, on and off, I've felt psychologically numb. It's not a particularly good feeling. Well, actually it isn't much of a feeling at all. It usually interrupts the depression and leaves me feeling completely empty. I haven't spoken to my family in almost six months and I honestly do not miss them. My wife pretty much cannot stand me nor I her. I think she's sick of my neurotic depression and anxiety or whatever the fuck it is that's wrong with me. There isn't really much reason to keep drawing breath, well other than cowardice. I've always found it strange that suicide is often referred to as the ""cowards way out."" If it's really so cowardly, then why is it so hard to do it? One of these days I'm gonna work up the courage. I think it'll be during one of these emotionally dry times when I do. I'm only writing this because you guys seem to care when people go on long, melodramatic rants like I so often do. Eh, I guess I can always delete this post if I later feel like an idiot. "
"Ok you wonât believe what my school just did. They PAID this guy to come in to speak to our high school.  (I go to a Christian school for context). Here are some of the points this speaker made:

1. âEvery one of you in this room is depressed.â He said that word for word. Like, Iâm not depressed at all, but dang thatâs offensive to those who are actually depressed. Being sad for a second is not being depressed.

2. âBoys and Girls should not be friends.â He said to avoid temptation, boys should not be friends with girls. And they should NOT ride in the same car together, and you also should ride in a car with the same gender if theyâre older than you.

3. âYou will never be the strongest, the smartest, the cutest, etc. and you will never make it in lifeâ There wasnât even a But. He just said we were never gonna make it in life and changed the subject.

4. âIf you were to die in a car crash tomorrow, odds are, nobody would care. Nobody would probably go to your funeral. Yeah, your parents might be sad for a bit, but they probably wonât even skip a meal for you.â WHAT THE ACTUAL HECK!!! Imagine being depressed and hearing this. Imagine thinking about suicide and hearing this. Do you realize how awful this is. He didnât even use it to prove a point, he just said it!

5. âIf you listen to music, it is literal garbage. The only music that is not garbage is Worship music. Cleanse your playlist by downloading all the worship music that you can, cause all other music is garbage.â ...no. I mean of course there is garbage music (cough Cardi B cough), but that doesnât mean all music is garbage. I honestly canât just sit and vibe to gospel music, does that make me a bad person?

6. âThat girl in the back, yeah her, she didnât give me a fist bump in the hallway today.â Okay first of all, that girl was known to be depressed. Second, you just finished talking about how she was worthless and nobody would care if she died. Third of all, youâre getting upset because a 15 year old girl didnât give you a fist bump. Hereâs the thing though, when he said that, everyone applauded the girl and it was hilarious cause he was like âwhy are you cheering for herâ itâs safe to say that nobody liked the speaker.

7. There was a lot of smaller points that I canât remember but there was a lot more. 

I was FUMING after this. Like youâre seriously coming and saying this to a group of 13-18 year olds and getting away with it???

"How do I avoid death Today I accidentally slept through all of my online classes. My school has a shortened day on Wednesday, and I had woken up 2 hours before my classes started.

"Iâm alone and I have already planned my suicide, I just needed a little push to end it all, today I got it.I lost all my friends and people I could trust throughout last year and last mouth. I was only left with 2 people that I THOUGHT I could trust. I realized that I couldnât trust one of my 2 left friend when he told some people about my problems, not hoping to help me, but to make fun of me.

"No desire to do aniethingLast 7 years since I graduated high school I basicly did nothing with my life I just waited the days to pass I slept for 12 hours a day I just waited till the weekend or till the next party so I can get drunk , I attended difernet universities and dropped out because I wasn't doing shit at them just waited for I don't know what. I don't know and I don't want to do anything so now I set my mind during this Sommer to do something different to not wait to do something  I didn't do before something that noraml people do and if I fail and return to the same waiting for something to happen mentality I'm going end it.
Biggest problem is my crippling anxiety and depression that one of the reasons why I never even try is of the mentality I'm going to kill miself eventually so why even bother now I'm on the brink of it and it's all of nothing. Any advice from people who changed everything about the way you think would be apriciatedt."

"BLM needs to focus on black on black crime more than it has 
Iâm as Liberal as can be, but BLM needs to focus on black on black crime big time.

The stuff theyâve already done is amazing. Theyâve already defunded a few police departments, and are pushing for what is right, but by far the biggest problem is black on black crime.

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/US/black-black-crime-loaded-controversial-phrase-heard-amid/story%3fid=72051613)


Many children live in impoverished hoods in large cities. They need to push to fund the families in those hoods and be able to support them. Many people in that place canât see any way out besides selling drugs, and with that comes violence and corruption. BLM and really everyone needs to work to end that relentless cycle in the hood and urban areas. Itâs the main reason for black on black crime, which is by far the cause of most murders.

Donât get me wrong. Most of the black communityâs problems are from white people. The way many modern US cities were designed were to keep white people in certain areas and black people in certain areas. You can guess which on got the worse area. Now those hoods are over-policed, and that leads to the infamous police brutality.

Another thing is, many âhoodâ areas are completely forgotten about by the government, and mayor of that city. They donât care about them. We need to care. They wonât reconstruct anything in these old neighborhoods, they wonât get people living in poverty in those neighborhoods the right social services.

Itâs horrible, and needs to be spoken of more."

Itâs my birthdayItâs my birthday and I want to kill myself. Iâve never had a good birthday in my life. Iâve been depressed and suicidial for the past 3 years. No one cares about and no one would care if I was dead.
How do I reach outMy friend posted an article on my fb about suicide and told me to never say goodbye. She happened to do that on a day where my bipolar symptoms were acting up and it made me feel even more suicidal. I have another friend who I know also has mental illness problems and he is always there for me I know but idk how to tell him that I want to die. I mean he knows that I'm generally suicidal but I just want to talk to someone who loves me and I can't start the conversation cause idk what's going on in their lives and I don't want to burden them with my problems. I just want someone to love me the same way I love them. No one seems to remember that I exist. I just want a friend who really understands and a friend who will always respond. You guys always say to reach out and talk to someone so how do i do it. Cause I am one more step away from taking all my pills.

Even the repercussions Iâd have with suicide arenât enough to deter me anymore, even with how selfish it sounds, I donât really.. care that people who love me will be hurt anymore. And itâs terrible to say. But I feel so. So fucking miserable..
I know I think differently from most people and itâs a curse, I think I might have some fucking.. disorder because no one seems to function the way I do. And Iâm not saying this to seem smart or edgy but Iâm just.. not right. 
Iâve been in therapy for years and years, a majority of my life.. and they all say the same thing. âIt gets better. Everyone gets sad. Iâm here for you.â But in reality theyâre paid to say that, they say that to everyone, everyone says the same fucking thing but they donât really mean it and even if they _do_ it makes no difference because I genuinely donât want to live

not to forget iâm toxic in general. always looking to start conflict with others if i see it or iâm just a generally aggressive person. people around me tell me it takes a lot to be truly toxic and that iâm not toxic. that could be the case but how dare i let myself think about anything remotely positive about myself? 

i want to take my own life, theres been a strong urge this year."
"Giving me one last chanceThis is my first post and i really don't know why i'm doing it...

So as a lot of people from here, i've been suicidal for a lot of years,thinking about not being alive is kind of a relief for me but it always was more like a illusion...

Recently was my birthday, another shitty one but i think that maybe i can give me another oportunity before being serious and kill myself at least.

I want to give me one year to get thinks better,maybe found something that i can enjoy,someone or anything that can give me...hope...

If in that year everything seems the same or i failed and still hate my life, i will plan my death in the best possible way,so no one have to pay something or causing more troubles after it.

Sorry,i really don't know why i'm writing this, maybe i just need to express it,  have no friends or someone to talk about it.

Thanks for reading...and sorry for my english, is not that good.

Have a nice day."
Everyday I'm lonlier and closer.Everyday I care a little less.  Everyday I feel more detached from reality.  Before the only thing that kept me from doing it was that my parents are still alive.  But they understand less and less about me and we've drifted so far I don't even care anymore.  My friends sure as hell don't care.  Why should I?  No one cares and really at this point neither do I.  What's the point when all I know is hate?
how do people not get bored                t                i                 t               l                e
"I'm getting closer.It seems like every week I get closer to actually taking steps to initiate suicide.

Some days are better than others, and sometimes I actually have a glimmer of hope for my future. But for every step I take forward, I take 2 steps back.

To make a long story short, last year I dropped out of a prestigious university my first semester because of severe depression and social anxiety and failed half my classes. My parents were angry and disappointed. I got a job and started going to a community college to transfer to another university in a nearby city. Presently, I quit my job a couple months ago because I was no longer able to cope. I've lost faith in my education. I had a job interview for a place I really wanted to work at but I fucked it up. My family is so disappointed in me and I am a burden to them. I'm already in debt. My mental and physical health has deteriorated. I destroy all of my friendships because I'm stupid.

The only thing that gives me that little piece of hope is the possibility that I can make it through undergrad and apply to medical school and get in.

I've decided that if I don't get accepted to medical school then I 100% will kill myself.

So 1 of 3 things will happen:
1. I kill myself before I complete undergrad.
2. I apply to medical school, get denied, and kill myself.
3. I apply to medical school, get accepted, and go from there.

I am so uncomfortable being here I just want to go...I keep getting closer and closer. My plan is to buy a bunch of over the counter sleeping pills (I'm talking about a shit ton) and take them mixed with alcohol and my boyfriend's pain medications. I'm too fragile to be alive. I used to want to get better, now I don't even see the point."

"My 1 am ramblings Hello! Itâs 1 am and I should definitely be asleep. Anyway have you ever thought about life? Itâs a big concept isnât it. Now if you were religious itâs a lot easier to think about life, weâre created to show Godâs magnificence or sum shit (idk Iâm not religious). However, for any non-religious folks, what is the point of life? Nothing we do will have an affect in the grand scheme of things. Eventually the universe will die, our legacy will NOT live on and everything we did will have been for naught. So I suppose life is meaningless. But it is definitely fun, so many small moments you enjoy in life. Itâs still all for naught when you die though. Sometimes Iâm extremely curious what comes after death, but I can wait and see
TL;DR life is meaningless, enjoy it"

"I'm so very, very tired.I've been told to keep fighting.

Part of me thinks, I've spent a good half of my life pushing a boulder uphill, and now I'm tired. There isn't very much fight left at all.
But I've been told to just try a little harder. Wondrous things have a chance of existing a small ways higher up the hill. Amazing, fantastic experiences lie just ahead, they say. Even though that's what they told me the last time the boulder slipped, I haven't seen the wondors they speak of.

In truth, I am trapped in this human skin. intellectually, I know what is expected of me, appropriate responses, smiles, reactions. But on a base, instinctual level, I am lost. I don't understand how to do any of this. Friendship. Relationships. Planning ahead. Responsibilities. Being satisfied. Being happy.

If I asked you to describe how a particular image looked to your elbow, you would have no way of responding because your elbow not only lacks the functionality to see, but could not even attempt to approximate an answer as it never has known sight. Sight is foreign. Sight is both an abstract and conceptual term, to your elbow.
This life is the same. It is foreign. As if I was born missing some vital data chip. As if I was only reincarnated 75% completely before the connection was lost.

And I'm getting so very, very tired."
Hey u/mz62021. what's up with all the hand pics lmfao? I am amused but confused at the same time lol
"No goal in lifeI don't have a goal in life. Life feels pointless. Don't know what I want, but I know I don't want anything other than to stop existing. I don't even ""want"" death, it just happens to be the only way to not exist.

""Make finding a life goal your short term goal!"" Yeah, fuck you.

I don't understand why everyone has this idea that life is inherently good, and try to hammer that idea into me. Either that, or assume inherent goodness in life and try to give me reasons to want life. No, convince me why life is actually good, and I'll decide if it's worth it and what I want to do with it.

And no, ""think about the happiness you can have"" isn't a good argument because I can literally end my life now and happiness and sadness will both be irrelevant rather than going through sadness hoping for some dismally small amount of ""happiness"" that may or may not exist, may or may not satisfy me, and even if it does, it'll be like a piece of moldy bread thrown at me after I've been starving for days."
How do I run away and kill myself with the pandemic going onIâm done with life and Iâve made very bad mistakes and everyone hates me. I wanna die and run away... maybe hoping that running away will get me killed. But with the pandemic going On Iâm worried people will notice
"Not really feeling it anymore...I have been struggling to keep myself together for quite a few months now. For a couple years now it has felt as if I've been wearing a mask. People always tell me how I smile all the time, but inside, I'm not, nor do I know how to tell them. My family fails to understand my situation and brushes over it by changing the subject. Doing what I used to find enjoying is no longer enjoying. I fail to find happiness in everything I am doing. OCD isn't making my condition any better. I am a first year university student in honors classes which take up all of my day and deprive me of my sleep. I tend to go to sleep at 5 AM everyday only to wake up at 8 AM everyday feeling like it would've been better if I had not awaken. I tend to feel like a burden on everyone on a daily basis and fail to understand the value of my life. Everything I found the least bit enjoying has diminished with university starting. All of classes are extremely weed out, fast pace, and this online format is unbearable. I was also forced into honors classes by my advisor and sibling which has led me to feel even worse by losing trust in those I trust most. I am also not very social which doesn't help. Having self-taught philosophy has only led me to question the meaning of life more and incorporate that with my own. I guess I am just looking for help and I know I'm not the only one going through this."
"No driver's licence and unemployed. I don't see a future. I wish someone would kill me. (big rant)TL;DR: I've been unemployed since the day I was born, failed the driver's test a lot and I don't mind dying soon.

I'm attending college right now and things are okay there, but outside of that is a never ending stressful daily life. I'm applying to jobs here and there with a well reviewed resume but always have to deal with employers not giving me a call at all. All I want to do is get experience in any kind of part time job so I can add that to my resume. Isn't it funny that I'm willing to work hard but they don't want me? Plus, my dad has been very upset that I still don't have a job at my age. I've been also practicing driving a lot for about 3 years and failed the driving test 7 times. I talked about all of this several times to my dad but it seems that he doesn't empathize with any of what I say. At this point the thought of being killed isn't scary anymore. Thanks for taking your time and reading all of this. Sorry for my rant."
"maybe i'll see the game over screen maybe i won'tIm sick of this endless cycle of misery , cant even afford a pup to bring my hopes up. The only way out of this hell hole is to endure a few more years of the same bull or going through with my sick and twisted ideas of ending my conscioussnes . I feel no joy even doing a few push ups or talking to anyone. Isolation has made me literally insane

I really regret the day i decided to put the blame on me for the shitty things that happened in my life, it has been a non stop spiral of missed oppotunities, broken relationships, dreams getting crushed by my own impulsivity, all while my family watched and waited for me to magically snap out of it. 

I feel this lingering sensation of comfort knowing i won't have to deal with this anymore. Like anyone cares really, maybe i'll burn in hell "

Only alive for my moms sakeThe idea of hurting my mother is really the only thing that keeps me alive most nights. She's put so much effort into giving me everything I've ever needed and done everything possible to help me through my depression. I wish I could get hit by a car or diagnosed with a terminal disease so that at least she would know there was nothing she could have done. But I'm fighting a downhill battle and I don't know how much longer I can keep going for her sake. I just wish she could understand why I'd be happier in death. 
Just another day..As I sit here I am once again contemplating suicide. Nothing different from usual. Just like all the other times I will probably not go through with it. It doesn't help that this is the second time typing this since I accidentally closed the tab :/ Everything has become too much of a burden lately. Not even my usual emotional problems. School has once again become too much for me. It doesn't help that I have to deal with my parents calling me while drunk and telling me that I will never graduate. That I will fail out. That's a lot to handle when it comes from the only people that should be encouraging you. I believe they are right. My grades are slowly going down. As I type this I have a test in two hours that I am likely to fuck up. I can't handle the thought of failing. I'd rather end my life than fail school. This depression is so heavy and exhausting I need a rest.I know you will come here and tell me not to end it. That is why you are here. So do not worry I'm not immediately planning on ending myself. I'm waiting for winter break so I can rest and assess my situation without any stress. There are of course some serious emotional problems to handle on top of school but I will deal with those some other time. I wish you all to have the good day that I cannot. 
"Worried rant about my gf ðª- also give me advice plz Hey yâall so first of all TW for ed, sh, suicide, neglect, drug use, and maybe other stuff idk 

So basically Iâve had this girlfriend for almost a whole year now, (we starting dating on January 1st) and I love her more than the earth itself. This girl means so much to me. 

Recently, sheâs been opening up to me about her problems and stuff. I myself am not very stable as you may be able to tell from some of my previous posts. 

Anyway, so she tells me sheâs diagnosed for bpd and depression. Okay, great, I can deal with that. 

I find out her mother, her only parental figure, just. Doesnât buy her food. Her mom is either working or gambling, and even though has the money and resources to do so, doesnât give her enough money to buy her own food with or buys her groceries. She has also body shamed her for many years, so next thing I find out is that my girlfriend has an eating disorder. I also have an Ed, so I wasnât sure if I was really the right person to talk to her. 

Next thing I find out is that she cuts herself when sheâs bored. Just. Self harm for funnies yk. 

Next is that sheâs been using various drugs for many years. Sheâs been stealing her moms weed since Iâve known her, (we were 13, 15 now) and had lots of morphine given to her after a surgery. This brings me to my next subject. 

Tonight I found the worst of it, which is that she tried to kill her self mannnyyy times. Tonight being one of those times. She took way too many morphine pills and for the first time ever told me about it. I wasnât really sure what to do ngl, I canât go over to her house because I literally donât have her address and so I also canât call an ambulance or anything.  Nobody who knows where she lives is awake right now. Iâm super worried about her right now, even thought throwing up probably isnât a good idea given her ED history, im trying to convince her to throw up the pills. 

Iâm sorry if this made no sense Iâm trying to get thsi down quickly for advice."
Dont mind me just passing through To anyone who opened i hope you have a nice day.
"I HATE online school. Iâm so done with this. And itâs only been one situation. My Algebra teacher assigned a chapter one review online. I was like ok Iâll do it. So I start doing it and immediately start running into problems. Am I the only one that was taught that when their is a subtraction sign in front of a number itâs negative? For example the equation x = 7 - 18 would be x = 7 + -18. So it would equal -25. The computer thinks it equals 11 cause they read the equation as x = 7 - +18. In my chemistry class she just makes videos to teach the class, even if your physically in the call. Like YOUR RIGHT THERE TEACH THE CLASS! I might be stupid idk it just makes me so mad."
"I'm lostI'm 15 F and I have no friends, not even one person I'm a bit close to (except my family, but I'm not really close to anyone here either) and I feel like I'm gonna be alone for the rest of my life. When I'm surrounded with other people at school I feel like I'm just being awkward, not talking to anyone, and even if someone talks to me I just wanna be alone because I'm afraid my awkwardness will mess up all my interactions. Sometimes the only two solutions I see are either totally isolating myself from the society or suicide. But I know I don't wanna die I just want a solution to my problems."

"My annyoing little sister brat So I was in my own bed but my little sister stayed at my bed for too long, I told her it's my bed and want her to get out from my bed but she keep refusing. I tried pushing her to her own bed then she started crying like crazy! 

She won't listen then my mom came in then my little sister keeps crying like a baby. She acts like it's her own bed and acting selfish. I tried to have her a warning to get out from my bed but she cries and refuses to get out from my own bed. I know she is older than me but this is very annyoing why does my little sister even exist?!

I gave her 5 minutes to stay in my bed, after 5 minutes I asked her to get out from my bed but she refused again. Then I started pushing her to her bed with my feet. She cried like a autistic brat. But eventually my mom and dad caught me then lectured me.

I feel like I want to kill my sister violently. Man I wish I didn't have a little sister."

Hello my fellow normal teenagers So what can we agree on is normal
"Everyone should learn the same language Iâm not saying we should all learn 1 language exclusively but we should just all agree on a language and teach our children that in addition to the local language 

It would probably be either English or Latin but as much as I hate Esperanto itâs kinda perfect if youâre going to teach it to everyone but thatâs all itâs good for, imo it should be either Latin or Korean probably Latin cuz you wouldnât have to learn a new writing system and the grammar is relatively flexible, technically itâs not flexible but you can rearrange the words in a sentence in any order and it will mean the same thing even though only a couple of those will be grammatically correct"

"I don't want to die I just continue to make choices that are unhealthy.My family has a history of suicide. My grandfather and sister that I know of.. I don't want to die but each day I make unhealthy choices.  I suffer from alcoholism since the age of 13. I was molested by an older sibling as a kid. I forgave him because I know he was messed up too. I got pregnant at 14 and my kiddo just turned 18. He is great but I have failed him in lots of aspects. 

I somehow was able to create a decent career and income out the chaos so that at least isn't factoring in. Most days I wake up riddled with anxiety and self hate. I can't seem to forgive myself for past mistakes and am a constant embarrassment to myself. If I dont get up and go to work there is very minimal I want to do. I am addicted to my phone. I cant break put of my self imposed self hate cage. I have a decent house but don't show it the respect I should. Sure the pills have provided temporary fixes in the past but I don't want to relay on it. My problem is I have numbed myself for so long idk how it is to feel normal.  It's like I live through one shitty scenario after the next.  

Death doesn't scare me and the only reason I feel I am still here is for my kids. I cant intentionally take my life and leave them. But here I am everyday just a shell of a miserable human who struggles to find happiness.  I know my purpose is to provide and that does make me happy. But nothing else brings any type of joy. Not nature, not shopping,  not creating. And it might have to do with my addiction to my phone. 

Just want to say to anyone else who struggles you aren't alone. And knowing others experience my same pain is comforting as messed up as that is. One of the ways I got through being a teen parent was telling myself I wasn't alone. I wasn't the first or last to go through it."

Cum balloon
You and your friends are having a water balloon fight.
Everyone is being splashed with water and having a good time.
You, on the other hand have a more malicious agenda, you stayed
inside relieving yourself whilst filling up 3 balloons to the brim.
You step out on to the patio, strutting triumphantly into battle.
You take aim at your first of 3 victims and fire. Bullseye!
The first one hits Tim's head, drenching him in your sweet sticky love milk.
Keith and Jake look in terror as Tim has been desecrated and you
walk towards them with a sinister grin. Like clockwork, they scatter
predictably, letting you land a hit on each of their heads.
All of them lay on the ground crying, covered head to toe in your hunk spunk.

"What are my options? Because I don't see any.- 30 y/o M, Europe
- After getting graphic Design degree, started ""working"" (super casually) from home in a niche field. Was getting pennies (fraction of a minimum wage) but I liked it because it's comfy. Even though I have a bit of portfolio, my CV is completely empty.
- Not even paying any taxes (so no pension), just minimal health insurance.
- Started to feel depressed (obviously), spent few years doing therapy and trying different meds â no effect (positive or negative) or improvement.
- Somehow managed to get a job at a general graphic design studio. Still was depressed except now also tired and stressed. Quit after half a year because death seemed more attractive.
- In total have spent 9 years basically being a NEET and still feel like 16. Still live at home in the same room I have always lived.
- Don't want to kms but really don't want to live either. Have Nembutal ready to go.

I know the answer is probably obvious:

- ""Get a job, any job. So that you get a routine.""
- ""Start going to a gym, meet people.""
- ""Move out of home, start living adult life.""

But the problem (the way I see it) is:

- It's all generic advice while I'm honestly still a teenager in a 30 y/o body. I really don't know how ""career"", ""relationship"" or ""networking"" works. I need a lot of handholding. I need a dad I never had.
- Even if knew how to get a job, my CV is empty. Even if I did get a 9-5 job somehow, I hate the idea of it and have no energy.
- Wageslaving for minimum still wouldn't be enough to move out (so why bother?).
- Even if I did, I'd be all alone in some shitty cell far away instead of a house where there's family, quiet and a yard.
- And I didn't even get to my looks, especially fucked up teeth which put me in lose-lose situation: if I smile, I look retarded. If I don't, I look creepy. This means I can't fit in anywhere. To fix that I would need an expensive jaw surgery which is a catch-22.

"Finally timeIâm 33 years old, Iâve been suicidal since I was probably 7 or 8

I used to put all my pillows and blankets over my head at night and weigh them down with whatever I possibly could, hoping that I wouldnât wake up in the morning. 
Obviously, I would get restless in my sleep and escape my half assed suicide fort. 

I donât think I really knew what it meant to be âdeadâ, I just always knew Iâd rather not be alive. 

That feeling has never left and I think every decision I have made throughout my life has only been pushing me further toward this ultimate decision. 

Without getting too much into it, I have some childhood trauma that keeps me from fully forming relationships with the opposite sex. Iâve tried therapy and it does help to some degree but thereâs truly nothing that can stop these feelings. 

Iâve ruined two amazing relationships because of this. Two incredible humans with nothing but potential have had a lot of their lives destroyed because I came into their world and left only pain and hurt in my wake. 

The only thing that has kept me from taking the plunge is knowing that I will upset my loved ones; I know this is a common theme around these parts, but I donât care anymore. 

I have friends that I love, but theyâll get over it. Most of my family just thinks Iâm the weird one anyway, and theyâve seen this coming, they wonât be shocked or saddened, theyâll just have more to gossip about. 

I know Iâm rambling at this point, I just want to get it all off my chest. I have literally no reason to be alive any longer. 
My ex wonât let me see our pets, and thatâs my fault, I own up to that. I donât care much for my family, nor they for me. I love my friends tremendously but they, unfortunately, canât keep me happy enough to stay, and itâs not their job to do so anyway. 

I really donât know anymore. Iâve been taken with the idea of drinking a dangerous amount &amp; sleeping in the snow. Another month and itâll be cold enough to go quickly."

Someone who has been on the road to death their entire life. If you're reading this, I've probably overdosed on pills, and I'm now dead, finally at peace, and I hope that none of you have to suffer the same life as I have had to, and that no-one has to resort to the same option as I have."

"My suicidal thoughts now are so calm it's scaryI pretty much joined reddit and came straight here because I really need to let something out. I used to have suicidal urges a lot and I've attempted before. It used to be that my mind was in chaos and pain and suicide was a way to escape. It was panic and desperation. But over the last few months it's been different, I've contemplated my life, really deeply and I keep coming to the same conclusion. That after my mother and my dog passes the best thing I can do is die.
And I don't know if I want to die. Some days I do, some days I don't. But I spend maybe an hour or two each day, more on bad days, actively thinking about killing myself. And there is no panic. It seems like cold logic. And though I haven't attempted it scares me more than my attempts. I don't know how to fight my own mind when it's being rational. I don't even know who I am anymore. I don't know if I'm suicidal with a part that wants to live or if I want to live with a part of me that is suicidal.
I don't even know what I hope to get out of this. I guess I hope getting it out will help. Idk."
"There's nothing I can do. Seriously. [15M]First off, I have depression, I'm gay and no one knows, I'm a creationist along with my family, I don't have friends, and my school/ parents choose to ignore all the bullying I deal with. I haven't told anyone I'm gay, but I get called faggot daily, a kid stabbed me with a pencil yesterday and another person told me some people deserved to be stabbed. My parents just say ""I'm sensitive, I need thicker skin, I don't really get bullied kids are just cruel."" I don't know what else to do. Sure school will end then what? Go to college, get a job, never get married, die, the end. Why not just skip all the cruelty. I'm not that sad I just don't want to live in such a cruel immoral world anymore."
"Things fall apartI attempted to commit suicide when I was 15, 5 years ago now. I lived and got diagnosed with depression, put on medication, etc.

I thought I was getting better. I really was. I'm in my last year of college and I'm trying to get into graduate programs. I have a wonderful boyfriend of 2.5 years and everything was going fine. At least until a month ago.

My bf lost his job and we had to move back in with my parents. We quickly searched for a new job for him and luckily he landed one with pretty good pay/benefits. Maybe things weren't so bad. That isn't the case.

We're both miserable. Living with my parents is not healthy mentally nor physically. We can't sleep cause of incessant barking from their spoiled dog, there are moths invading every part of the house that they refuse to do anything about, and the place is just unpleasant to live in. Both of our depressions are getting worse. His new job has been stressing him out to the point where I think our relationship is going to die. Not like he'd be happier if I was there, though.

I don't want to be here anymore. I've been trying so hard over the past month to find a new place to live and get a job and quell my loneliness but there's nothing to show for it. I can't even go to my boyfriend cause he's so tired from working he just wants to come home and do nothing. There's no one for me to talk to. No one would miss me if I die. He keeps telling me that he loves me and that he needs me in his life but it's just so hard to believe when we barely interact with each other anymore. All I know is that he can't focus on me right now and it hurts, even if I think about it rationally.

I've been trying to help him as much as I could. Nothing seems to make me nor him feel better. He says he doesn't feel appreciated but neither of us know what to do to try and change things. I'm tired. I feel like a burden. No one will miss me.

As for my parents, they work all the time. I barely get to see them and I can't really talk to them. I don't want to stress them out with my suicidal ideations either, especially since we all thought I was getting better.

I just want the pain to go away. Everything just tells me removing myself from the equation will make everyone else's life better. I don't know how much longer I can go on like this."

"On the Recording of Zoom Meetings of Class To all students on distance learning:

It is actually illegal for teachers to record zoom meetings without the consent of everyone in the classroom. If you complain to the teacher about you being recorded, the teacher should stop recording immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Zoom makes it easy for hosts and participants to record class sessions. While it is useful to have a record of the class, each session will contain images of your students, along with identifying information about each of them. Youâll need permission from each student in order to record a class session. Youâll also need permission in order to use or share the recording anywhere outside of class. Once the recording has been shared, it, like everything on the internet, is now outside of your control.Â  The safest approach, in terms of student privacy, is to refrain from recording class sessions entirely.Â Â

"One sentence, one hard hit.Hello fellow brothers. Yesterday I happened to read an article on the news about australian Lucas Fowler and american Chynna Deese, who were murdered while travelling together through Canada last week.

&amp;#x200B;

There was a sentence pronounced by the family of Lucas that hit me like a brick. And is as follows:

 

&gt;*""We have lost our dear Lucas Fowler, son, brother,  grandson and friend in the most terrible of circumstances.* ***To lose  someone so young and vibrant, who was travelling the world and just  enjoying life to the full, is devastating****,"" the family said.*

&amp;#x200B;

Now, while we know that when people are in shock they have more chances of saying something not so adequate because they cannot think clearly, this particular sentence has some horrific dark connotations that   us here can catch at lightning-speed, unfortunately.

To lose someone ""young"" and ""vibrant"" is devastating, because he just came into this world, and did not had the time to experience all the marvelous opportunities awaiting for him out there. All his life was before him, he could have been become someone greater, a sucessful businessman, go out, party, have friends, form a loving family, become a renowned doctor, grow and learn, and now he cannot.

What about the depressed and suicidal individual, that perpetuates its misery since childhood? What about the socially awkward that is so afraid to talk to people that he misses opportunities of growth in high school and university, only to find out when he is 40, that not only is he yet a virgin not-by-choice, but has no friends, no pleasant life experiences, the only thing he does is work, eat, sleep and mindlessly dooze off to TV or videogames, and only looking back at his past, he can summarize his life as ""gripped by worry, anxiety, and depression""? Then it would not be so bad if this same man died 20 years before? If you were going to tell this man: ""Hey dude, your life is going to look like this shit in 20 years"", we can be almost certain the man would have taken his own life himself. Only the expectations of hope for change kept him alive all these years.

If the guy is ""travelling the world"" and ""enjoying life to the full"", then it is devastating if he dies because he appreciates life and what it offers to him, he is travelling because he has this curiosity and willing to know other cultures, grow, meet new people... 

And yet, what about the man with crippling depression, whose energy is sucked every single day, barely going through the day with enough energy to survive its life-sucking job, with just enough money for bills and food, and is only looking forward to the weekend so he can just feel a moment of relif until next Monday? Travelling? Enjoying life? When your mind is so fucked up that all your energies go to surviving depression, addiction, and anxiety, there is no more space for growing experiences. Then, would it be okay if this man were to die? Since he is not living life, and has no apparent willing to have fun, would it be less devastating?

Just what the hell is happening here?

We have the same right as anybody else to be happy. We just happened to have a set of circumstances, biological, circumnstancial, environmental, that have made us the broken individuals that we are today. But even so, we do not deserve to die, we do not want to die, what we want is just a relief of this neverending nightmare that is being in our mind.

I almost cried when I read that because there are some people that do not care anymore to live because they have been dead inside from a long time. I wanted you to know that you are not alone, nobody taught us to live, and we did a miserable job at it, but we did the best we could with out limitations. Let's just keep trying one more day for the hopes of a better tomorrow.

If you have survived until now while coping with your mind's nightmarish thoughts, then pat yourself in the back because you are made of fucking steel. My heartfelt thanks to you for keeping to fight at my side.

Peace."

"Just had the weirdest mental breakdownBackground, Iâm a closeted trans woman in the south. I was having a gender dysphoria episode and I did what I usually do to calm myself: I practiced the organ on the other side of my college campus. The organ is up about 20 feet from the floor below with very minimal bars to protect the organist from falling. After finishing my practice session, I sat there just staring at the fucking balcony. I kept thinking âdonât fucking do it, just come out and shit will get better.â Then the other side of my mind was like âWhy not do it? Youâll never pass, and you said it recently yourself online: youâd rather be dead than be a man for another second.â I sat there like this for 20 minutes. Then it started thunder storming and I needed to get back to the dorm before the dorm buildings closed. 

Then I get this fucking crippling feeling like Iâm being watched (I checked like 20 times, no one was watching me). I wanted to get back to the dorm via the road, but then I heard a pop, and my fucking brain thought it was a gunshot and I bolted for the dorm.

TL;DR Being a closeted trans woman is going to fucking give me depression and severe anxiety, and I donât know what to fucking do."

"I can't stop wanting a girlfriend and it's making my life miserable.I'm 25 years old and I can't help but think why my time hasn't come yet. Every girl I've talked too either didn't like me or already had a boyfriend. Every single one of my friends have a girlfriend except me. It doesn't help that I was left out on a lot of things growing up, like getting picked last in sports or not getting picked at all and working alone when it's suppose to be a group project, and now the same nightmares still haunt me as an adult. I'm left out again on something that everyone wants. I guess maybe I only want one because everyone else has a girlfriend. If everyone had a Lamborghini but you didn't, wouldn't you want one too?

Any free time I get is spent thinking about what went wrong growing up and why I havn't found anyone yet. It's making me depressed and suicidal. It's making my outlook on life boring and bland and pointless. This just means that I have to keep myself busying from thinking about all this but it's already hard enough going out on public and seeing all these couples.

I'm watching everyone else live my dreams. I guess I could just accept it but then what? Am I suppose to sit and watch everyone else live my dream that doesn't require a degree or specific training? I don't even know how to accept this. I don't know where to start. I've read so many stories of people who stayed single their whole life and it wasn't their decision too. I just can't believe this is actually happening to me. I don't want to wait until I'm 30 years old or 35,40,50, 60... to finally find love and experience sex that people half my age are already doing. This kind of thinking makes me want to end it all. I wish I was asexual. I don't want to want women anymore. They don't want me.

I cannot afford to have it looked at, I can't get on disability without having it looked at, and I cannot get a desk job to hire me.

I only have my fiancÃ© and my dog..

My brain torments me everyday. Im scared that if I goto a therapist I'll be institutionalized which will just destroy me. I just want the pain to stop, I want my brain to stop yelling at me! I want to be myself again or I want to be dead and so far... I don't think I'll ever be me again."

"Talking to non-sufferers about major depressive disorder*I've spent a lot of time thinking about how to properly articulate some of my thoughts about our condition to non-sufferers, or people who just simply don't understand or believe in it.*

*I decided to finally sit down and try to put it in writing and I want to share this with you in case it may be able to help anyone talk to family, friends, or colleagues who've struggled to understand what you're going through, while giving them a new vocabulary to use when discussing depression with those suffering from it.*

*Feel free to share if it you think it would help. I also [published this on my blog](http://l-a-t-r-a-c-e.com/talk-about-depressing/).*

**/// ""Talk about depressing"" ///**

There are people you will encounter at some point in your life, including your own friends and family members, who are struggling every day with a condition that is well-known but frequently misunderstood: depression.

Major depressive disorder is a lonely condition. People who struggle with it typically feel that they are fighting a battle for their life all by themselves. Depression also often causes a self-imposed isolation and unfortunately, mainstream attitudes towards the condition makes it difficult for sufferers to reach out to friends, family members, and colleagues for fear of rejection or stigma.

No one should have to die alone. Stopping the stigma towards depression and suicidal ideation will help save lives.

Think about this: If someone you knew and loved came to you this very moment telling you that they had a plan â and a will â to end their life, how would you react? What would you say? Is this something youâve ever thought about before? Itâs an important thing to consider.

Despite what advertisement campaigns for anti-depressants depict, depression is not just sadness. Itâs not just an emotion and itâs not a âcloud.â Itâs also not a choice. Clinical depression is a real mental illness that affects peoplesâ ability to thrive in their life and career and build meaningful, long-lasting relationships.

The way we talk about major depression and other mood disorders has an effect on peoplesâ ability to cope with their condition and the way they are perceived by the people they love and work with.

Here are a few common tropes that Iâve heard over the years and my suggestion for a better response:

âthat sucksâ = âIâm sorryâ

âman upâ = âIâm here for youâ

âhide the crazyâ = âit takes all typesâ

âwherever you go, there you areâ = âwe all take different pathsâ

âthey couldnât hack itâ = âthey didnât get the help they neededâ

When someone does ultimately end their life, itâs a loss for everyone in their community. The theme of someone not being able âto deal with itâ or suggesting that someone âtook the easy way outâ is a cruel reaction based in social Darwinistic thought in which only the strong survive.

This way of thinking is to suggest that the person who was lost didnât deserve love and didnât deserve dignity in life or death. Itâs simply a way of thinking that devalues life.

It also suggests that displaying vulnerability and suffering from depression is a sign of weakness.

Weâre all trying to make sense of the world and our place in it. For some, itâs much harder than others.

Thereâs also the theme of depression being âcontagious.â It may be unfair to expect too much of any one person or friend when going through an episode, but people who rebuff or put down those who are struggling are only further emboldens the stigma of the condition and those who open up about their experience with it.

âWhy canât you just be normal?â This is something sufferers probably ask themselves frequently. Itâs not easy thing to deal with, and getting older and taking on more responsibilities and higher stakes only makes it that much worse.

The trauma of being pushed away by friends, being fired from a job, or struggling to find a partner also becomes increasingly more difficult to bear and increasingly more internalized. We ask men to be more open about their emotional state, but turn them away when they are.

Thereâs more we can do for sufferers than point them to the suicide prevention hotline. By simply changing the way we think and talk about depression, thereâs a good chance that we can collectively put an end towards the stigma and allow people to seek the help they need.

In fact, if we really do value human life, itâs necessary that do so."

"Trying to hold onI thought many of the troubles that had made me suicidal the first time had passed-- I had made friends finally, my parents' marriage was improving, etc. However, my mental health has begun to drop again lately. Im not consuming more than 500 calories a day mostly (yesterday I only had ~100), I began cutting again, I can't walk without constant pain (preexisting ankle injury), my parents' marriage is in shambles, my family has a horrific amount of medical bills so our money is getting tighter, and I'm a worthless wreck that won't get anywhere in life. I'm probably just complaining about stupid stuff but now I don't really know why I should get up in the morning when nothing is improving and I can't even afford professional help. On top of it all I'm starting to question my sexuality which isn't what I need right now with the amount of stress I feel.  I was hoping this was all teen angst that would blow over but it isn't and I really don't want to live as a burden or annoyance to anyone anymore. I don't even know why I'm bothering you guys here...I guess I just needed a place to get my feelings out before anything bad happens to me."

"How can i get helpSo i'm from the UK but working overseas for a couple of months. My depression has reached a point where i consider it life threatening. I don't have a dr in the country i'm in (germany) as i'm not a resident. My Dr in the UK can't refer me for psychiatric help unless i'm in the UK.

Aside from talking to the likes of Samaritans or Calm over the phone i don't have any hope of getting treatment, diagnosis, therapy, medicine, etc. 

Anyone been in a similar situation amd able to give advice? I'm at a loss

"Thoughts on dating through Discord? So a few weeks ago one of my friends said they liked me and I liked them back. Every since we have been dating. Turns out at the end of the school year she moves an hour and a halfâs drive away. We still want to make it work and thought that we could use Discord and visit sometimes during the summer. We met on Discord when a friend introduced us and we were entirely online friends for a year and then when we met in person we realized that we liked each other. So, what is your opinion on dating mostly through discord? Do you think it will work (especially if we visit once or twice person year?) do you think sheâll cheat on me? Iâm stressed and really sad so any help is very much welcomed."

"Why do people stop others from killing themselves or guilt trip other people when they let the suicidal person die?I really want to know why. Please don't say that ""life is good"" and that ""you can always find hope"". Because it's not the case for everyone. Some people suffer their entire life no matter how much support they have, some people can't afford/get the help they need and some people just can't find it in themselves.Help is not reachable for everyone and even at times, it can not work. And for the 'life is good even though it has its ups and downs', no life is different for everyone.Sometimes life can have more ups than downs for some people and sometimes it has more downs than its ups for some people.Sometimes the 'downs' are more stronger than the 'ups'.Sometimes the 'ups' aren't enough for you to hold on.Sometimes they are. So, i'm asking: is it better to let someone kill themselves or is it better to force someone to live a life that they don't want to live and make them suffer even more? Some people are just lost causes.No matter how much support they have in their hands, sometimes they just can't find the motivation to get better in thenmselves and there is NOTHING no one can do to 'cure' them. Sometimes the only way is to kill themselves."

"Worried I have finally reached my limit.Iâve dealt with severe depression/anxiety since i was 12. The self harm started then, too. That didnât stop until I was 17, and cutting stopped giving me the temporary distraction i was looking for anymore. I always thought finally becoming old enough to move out would be the answer to a lot of my problems, as my mother was extremely abusive and was often the cause of my breakdowns. But it has been almost 4 months now of me working what I thought was my dream job, living in my own apartment with my best friend/roommate, my own pets, doing everything EXACTLY the way I always wanted it. 

But every singly morning for the last 2 weeks I just wake up and instantly feel more dread than usual for my day, I sob uncontrollably for at least an hour each morning while trying to get ready to go to work. I sit through my meaningless job for 9 hours each day, to then go home miserable with nothing to look forward to, except doing it all over again the next day. I havenât felt this deeply submerged in sorrow this consistently for as long as I can remember. I feel I may finally snap and end my life, finally. 

I texted a crisis help line this morning while I was at work, trying not to start sobbing again. It provided temporary relief for about an hour, but all my normal feelings have resurfaced, and all I can think about is driving over the bridge instead of to my home once I leave this building in about an hour. 

Not sure what I thought posting this would do for me but, I guess I just needed to get that off my chest. Iâm hoping I donât make it to tomorrow. "

"I have nothing left. Everything is gone.I have lost everything. My job. My partner. My mind. 

My parents would be devastated if I killed myself but I just canât do this anymore. 

I had a breakdown and had to go stay with my mom. I wanted to kill myself every day. I had vivid scenarios play out in my mind of how Iâd do it. I attempted several times. The only thing that kept me going was the possibility of coming home to my partner. She didnât come visit me once. She wanted me to come home and wouldnât see me unless I did.

I finally made it home and she said sheâs not in love with me anymore. She keeps waffling between going to counseling to work it out with me and going to convince me to be her friend. After she asked me to marry her one year ago tomorrow. So thatâs it. Everything is lost. I have nothing. Everyone can only give me useless platitudes about how everything will work out. No one knows that. Itâs been going more and more to shit with every passing day. I want to kill myself. The most painless way possible. But I canât. I couldnât do that to my parents. But I have nothing left to live for. I pray every day to get killed while Iâm driving. The least God could do, if he exists, after all Iâve been through, is to just kill me."

"I think i fucked upI'm supposed to graduate next year and I still don't know what to do with my life. Everytime my family asks me what career i'm gonna have, the answer changes, from artist, to surgeon, to musician, to military, to video game design, etc. I lost the inner artist in me, they straight up deny me of being a surgeon, can't join the military because of a past surgery that fucked me up real good, they laugh at the thought of me doing game design, and thats just to name a few. I took up guitar and that sparked some hope in me that i could be a musician, until they told me its a hobby and not a job. They think what i mean when i say musician is playing music for people in bars, clubs, and shit like that. What I mean is making music for things like video game sountracks and stuff like that. My godbrother seemed to understand what i meant when i told him i wanted a music career, he even recommended a great college. But then again, ""its a hobby, not a career."" I don't know why my parents can't understand. I just can't win. I'm scared of the future. "

"I'm just tired of all this shit...Since i was five shit started happening. After i was born my mom moved all the way from nice, crisp, polite, warm-heated colorado, all the way to cold, humid, ghetto, dirty south florida. I've grown up seperated from my family. I've only lived with my mom and sister (and dad up untill i was five). My father was always a heavy drinker. He would come home late and piss my mom off. One day she had enough and kicked him out. It wasn't till i was eight that i figured out he wasnt fucking coming back. Since then i've only seen him ten times and last christmas and my last birthday he didnt call like he usually does. I wish i actually knew him as a father. He's just another asshole in this shit caked world. My mother is verbally and physically abusive. More verbal than physical. My sister couldnt be more of a bitch. everyone always puts me down. Mostly them two. My mom always tells me that i'm just like my dad. good for nothing low life. That i'll never amount to anything. Fuck her. I have a lot of anger, but i keep it bottled up. No one cares about what i feel or have to say. None of them understand. And it took me an entire month to figure out that i was completely alone. All i had was me. I cant keep a girlfriend, and the one i have now doesnt fucking understand either. I live in constant fear that i will end up like my dad. He haunts me 24/7. This causes me to struggle with things. I am a D student and always get into trouble, i do bad things, fight, talk back, tell teachers/cops off. even friends. I've came close to killing myself. I pussied out because i was scared of what happens after death. But i often wish that i would have done it what i had the chance. I hate this world we live in. People = shit. people tirelessly try to get to the top. They step on people to get there. It makes me fucking sick. I = shit. i wont ever do anything to change anything. For me or for others. I try my hardest to do good. I volenteer. Help people when i can. BUt i'm always never appreciated. And i'm sure as hell nothing would change if i were gone. I've helped many people with their suicide problems.... But i cant help myself. I want death so bad. I think of it was a nice, cold, drop of sugar water after a long, dehydrated, hot walk through a wasteland. Help me reddit... You're my only hope."
"Student loan debt and lonelyI made the grievous error of going to law school and accumulating hundreds of thousands in debt. I recently graduated and am looking for a job while waiting for bar results, but even if there's a slim chance that I pass I will still have no means to pay it off. I don't think I make a good attorney -- I'm socially incompetent and get flustered when given simple assignments. Any job I acquire I'll surely be fired from. 

This would all seem like nothing if if I felt like I had more of a social network. Last year I lost my best and only friend due to drug induced psychosis. I recently tried to reach out to her parents to see how she was doing and received no reply. I've lost other friends because of the person that I was, and although I believe I've grown the memory of those friendships still haunt me. I wake up from very vivid dreams where these people are still in my life and I didn't make any mistakes.

For the past hour I've desperately been trying to find a way to acquire nembutal or some guaranteed painless form of suicide, but to no avail. I just don't want to exist anymore with my pain and lack of social grace, and yet somehow I fail at that as well. "

"Unloved, meaningless, broken, worthless.I feel like, in just a few short months, I've gone from ""struggling twenty-something hanging on and trying to make it"" to ""poor lower class broken cog."" I have zero sense of self-worth or pride in myself. I can't carry a conversation with people I used to be good friends with because all I can think is that I can't say too much or they'll see that I'm defective. I spend at least half the time I'm awake thinking about killing myself. Statistically, I don't matter. I can already hear myself starting to sound like a ""crazy person,"" the sort of person I would have mocked six months ago or more. I just feel so broken and I don't want to live this farce anymore. I exist only as a cog in the machine of wage slavery. My youth is gone and the last door of opportunity are closing. I'd rather die than keep suffering indignity."

"I don't want to live.It's really just that. I'm 18 and I don't want to live. I don't enjoy living. I want to be with my girlfriend but we're seperated by thousands of miles right now. I can't afford to see her. I try for jobs everywhere but I can't find one. I want to kill myself but that would hurt too many people. 

If I was truly alone I would probably have offed myself by now. The only reason I won't is because I don't want to hurt anyone. My girlfriend would be devastated and so would my parents when they found out. I also have an 8 year old sister that deserves a good big brother.

I really want to kill myself but I couldn't because of all the harm I'd cause. I won't kill myself, I just don't want to live. I don't like telling people this because I'd rather them think of me as a happy guy. 

I don't really know why I'm typing this out now but I wanted to vent. It makes me feel a little bit better."
"Feel like being gone is the only way to winIâve never posted here before and I donât know why I feel like I should today, because Iâm really not at my absolute lowest point. 

Iâm just struggling a lot with some past traumatic things I experienced last year and canât seem to outrun them, or to really outrun anything honestly. 

Iâm depressed, Iâve gained so much weight the past few months, Iâm not adapting to anything well, I cringe endlessly at everything I do and say because Iâm so grossed out at myself and who I am, and Iâm just fucking tired of being here. 

I have a constant dialogue running in my head that says âyou could just kill yourself,â or âyou wonât be here long enough for ____ to matter.â It can be as simple as fucking up a gift Iâm wrapping. 

The really overwhelming thing is that I canât shake the thought that dying would mean people would finally believe everything Iâve needed them to believe. Mainly about the traumatic event that seemed to be a joke to the police, like I relish the mental image I have of writing a letter to them and mailing it before I die so they know what they did and what others did ruined a person. 

But even just in a larger sense, everyone would realize I was always struggling and this isnât just some phase or something I want for myself. I want out of the pain but I donât feel ready. 

Iâm just tired of fighting with myself. Even though Iâm better than I was a year ago, Iâm still fighting daily and I donât understand how thatâs sustainable. "

"I Keep Taping Bread to the CeilingI have Bipolar type 1 and my manic episodes have been increasing. Usually when I have these episodes I start throwing stuff and screaming along with severe hallucinations. I keep seeing this old lady in the corner of my room. She has really outstretched smile to the point that it looks like her jaw is dislocated. Originally she just stayed in the corner, but now she is moving around. I tried to go into my garage last night to scream and I saw her walking up to the door. This is the first time Iâve ever seen her visually move. I have a voice in my head that keeps telling me that if I tape bread to the ceiling sheâll go away. I attempted to run back to my room and get the bread and she tried to grab me when I opened the door. She grabbed me on my ankle, which is where my other hallucination I have often grabs me. It was like a cold, familiar feeling. I have now been in my room for the past few hours taping bread to the ceiling. She hasnât come back since I started, so I think itâs working. Iâm just scared when my parents come in my room that theyâll think Iâve gone insane. Does anybody know what I should do and how to stop hallucinations?"

Don't get me wrong, he is a great bro, I play mc with him all the time, we go to the lake and chill, etc... But lately he's been acting pretty gay  (in a joking way) like grabbing my behind or making sexual jokes very often.

This is getting very annoying and I'm afraid I'm gonna lose my temper very soon and hurt him

"I am all out of options.I graduated college in 2008 with a great well playing job. Made great connections and people were telling me I was ""going places"" it was a good time. In 2012, I get laid off and the company was cutting budgets. 2013, got laid off again. 

I was unemployed for a year looking for jobs, hitting up my connections, took an unpaid internship. Nothing. Nothing happened there were no jobs to be had, even as a receptionist. I had a break down and I went into therapy. It worked. Still went on interviews and I would come up as not exactly as what people wanted. Interviews would go well, great conversation about the job. I would back up my past experience.  Still nothing. I finally get a part time job working at a cafe. Nothing in my career. 

I said fuck this and moved to NY so I can have more opportunity. I've gotten a few things but nothing to pay the bills. My contacts all tell me the same thing, we like you but we have no open positions. I've been here for 6 months trying to change careers and I interview and I come up short everytime. I am never good enough and I don't know where to go from here. My connections will not talk to me, they all say they are worried about their jobs.  I am 31 and at this point I am only qualified for entry level where as a person I feel more than that. I don't portray that ""I am better than this"" in my interviews.  

I can not get a full time job. After therapists and job coaches I still can not get a job. At this point I see no other way out. I feel like I am worth more dead than I am alive and I feel like nothing that I do can change my situation. 

Now I am getting older and more and more further detached to the working world. My friends have no issues, but I cant and I just don't get it. They all tell me to ""keep trying"". Well I mean that has been my full time job for 3 years.

It's been 3 years since my layoffs and now I feel like I am at the point of no return that I am suppose to be jobless. But I need money to live."
"I hate it when people assume I'm a SJW who hates everyone who's not a minority only because I'm a left leaning centrist. Every demographic has its own issues and is discriminated against to some extentent, so instead of fighting against each other, let's fight together, I love y'all. &lt;3"
"I think my friends don't like me anymore So, I have been part of a large friend group at my high school for the better part of 4 years, and only recently it has become apparent to me that I have been very slowly dropped from the inner circle and I'm on my way out of the group in general. Now, of course, mentioning this to any of the people in the group ends with the same result, a half-assed response which is a blatant lie to try and keep my feelings from being hurt.

Very recently, I feel as if nobody actually wants me in the group, from a massive lack of acknowledgement during conversations, constant jokes directed to me which at times just feel like plain bullying, a pure lack of trust in anything I say (Despite the fact I have made an effort to speak as honestly as possible), leaving to go elsewhere when I approach the group, to straight-up eye-rolls directed at me in very rare cases.

I might sound like an anxious, attention-seeking loser who overthinks everything I do, but I genuinely think that they all don't like me anymore. Being left out of things isn't the worst part of what they do, but being directly lied to, knowing that it's a blatant lie, with evidence to prove that it's a lie, hurts the most. 

Does anyone have any advice or personal experience on this subject?

Wait no people can see your boners Oh god this opens up a whole new realm of embarrassment I donât even want to think about
"I don't get it.Why won't they let me die. WHY!?!?! I DON'T FUCKING GET IT! Why can't they just kill me. Every day gets worse. I add nothing to the world. WHY why why why. I can't tell anyone this or they will lock me up in the psych ward again. I don't get it. I just dont get life. I just can't do life. I'm losing my fucking mind over here and can't tell anyone. I can't even drink to get to an altered state of mind. I'm too young. I hate my existence. I hate everything about myself. I feel like an animal on the road that got ran over, it's guts hanging out of it, yet it is still alive. It is in tremendous pain, but everyone keeps driving by. No one is helping it. "

HelpI canât function. I am out of work for my mental health and yesterday I was told a coworker killed himself. He was such a smart and amazing guy. I am struggling to understand why I am here and he isnât. Itâs not fair. I feel so guilty. I didnât help him. I had to distance myself to keep myself on the right track. I feel so selfish and undeserving of life. Nothing matters anymore. Nothing. I canât see a point to holding on. I canât. I think I need to be done here
"This guy like me or no? So, basically I have this friend and he keeps giving me little hints that he likes me, but idk, HE IS SO FUCKING MYSTERIOUS! so pls help me.
2 days ago he said I looked like an e-girl. Then, today, I was talking to him and he said: oh, Iâm not going to kiss anyone, just this e-girl ( IDK IF IT WAS ME OR NO) 
Also, the other day I slept on his shoulder and he texted me later saying: you slept on my shoulder 
Then I said: yeah, I know 
Then he said: it was on purpose thenð³ð³ ? ( YES, HE ADDED THIS FUCKING EMOJI) 
And I said: yes, thatâs what friends are for. 
Anyways, does he like me or not? I DONT FUCKING KNOW AND IM DESPERATE"
Date is approachingI have been trying to commit suicide for the past couple of months. I've been trying to hang myself by a belt and doorknob and I got up to 4:24 without passing out. After that I chickened out and couldn't take it anymore. I plan on commit suicide in the next few weeks. I have rope and I'm going to duct tape my hands so I can't untie the noose
"I want to stab my heart with a thousand knifesI feel so rejected and unwanted. For once I stood up for my life decisions, my open marriage to my family, and they scrutinised me, and I left the house to go home and they said I was selfish to leave and that Iâd upset everyone. 

I have had messages all day about how I am messed up and need help, how Iâm crazy, even though I regularly visit a therapist, take medication, exercise, socialise, and do everything I can to ensure a healthy mental state. 

I left my coat and book at the house, which is an hour away from my home. I gave my husband gas money to drive and get it and he forgot the book. Itâs a library book. I have a responsibility to return it but I cannot go all the way back there and face those people who reject me.

I turn to my husband, angry and resentful because I gave him one simple task and he tells me that itâs my fault anyway for leaving the house. He went to sleep on the couch and I yell at him and he calls me a bitch. I thought we were a team. 

Everyone is making me feel crazy. I hate them all. I am not crazy. I imagine tearing out my heart and stabbing it until I feel nothing anymore. I hate them. Why the fuck is this happening? What the fuck did I do to deserve this shit? I have no one to turn to anymore. 

The library is going to hate me too."
"I used to be the best now im at my lowesti used to be the best last year, i loved my life. i had just recovered from one of my lowest times in my life and i had just gained the best friends a guy could ask for, my grades were high and i kept a 4.0, i felt like i was living in all vibrant colors. but then, flash forward to this year im fucked, i cant bother to do anything anymore. my grades are at their fucking lowest, im failing for the first time in my life i dont know how to deal with this shit and all my friends who ive worked so hard to outplace are all living happy lives while i fucking suffer. i used to suffer before last year too, why canât i have more than one year of success. why the fuck do i have to go back after all ive done to get out of the pain i cant fucking deal with this shit what kind of cruel god puts me through one of the best years on my life only for me to come crashing down to my rock bottom. i donât want to deal this this shit anymore im going to od tonight fuck school fuck my teachers and fuck everyone"

"âdonât talk backâ is stupid Itâs not stupid in every situation. If a kid is being a outright rude, then I understand. Unfortunately though, parents (shitty ones) that use the âdonât talk backâ card when theyâre being a prick and want to get away with it are actively displaying crappy communication skills to their kids and itâs completely counter productive.

My grandmother is a light sleeper and my father has a pattern of being inconsiderate to all other people if he feels like it sometimes. Itâs definitely his main character flaw to say the least lmao. Anyways he was in the kitchen, slamming drawers and the microwave, and I asked him to try and be a little quieter so my nana doesnât wake up. This apparently was wrong? 

I was told that heâs gonna âdo whatever he wantsâ (keep in mind he doesnât pay rent, utilities, or much else for that matter cause itâs her house), and that Iâm a bitch for âtalking backâ after this and defending myself, anddd that as âhis childâ I cannot âdisrespectâ him. 

In my eyes, heâs the only one being disrespectful, to my grandmother and to me lmao. I donât get it. Why are some parents just on a power trip and want to use this card? Itâs infuriating."
"Life gets darker and darker everyday.Soo..

Im chosing to do it-commit suicide. When i dont know. How i dont know, but here is why.

My family now has split apart. Im with my brother in school and mother and father are in diffirent country. 

We are poor too so i dont even now have money to go home. 
Im stuck here in schools hotel.

My school problems keep piling up and i cant deal with it. Im not smart enough for this school or for any school. 
My life were fu*ked up before but now is the end of the line. 

Once i hit 18 im out of the school, they throw me away, i wont get a job too. 

And i have many difficulties with money. I eate once a day. At evening. I drink coffee and smoke to get my head streight everyday. I can afford something good sometimes but very rarely.

Everything keeps piling up and i cant run away so suicide is easy road out of this. I dont care how parents will react and how somebody what i know reacts i just want to get out. 
Actualy i dont think anyone will notice that i'm gone. 

Anyone else have a situation like this? How did you manage to fix it? And why did you wanted to fix it?

I think i have lost all hope."
"I played first piano concert last night!! I hear my name called, and I am instructed to walk out onto stage. I'm sing, quivering. As I walk out, I trip on some wires, so that was embarrassing. I get to the piano and bow, people clap, I sit down. 

The very first note I play. Is wrong.  

But then I correct myself, and now. I'm shaking so hard. I black out. Luckily it was all on camera, but in my head, I honestly remember nothing of the rest of the piece. But, according to the video, apart form the start, I nailed it ;)

Ughhh. Why is it that whenever a girl punches you it's just playing. But ohhhh no when guys punch a girl we get charged with assult But why. Why would you do that?
"Can't cope with guiltBackstory: I was recently married this past year to an amazing women who i love deeply but it has triggered some depression and anxiety over not being good enough. (Years of physical and emotional abuse by father). My mind has looked for everything in my past for any wrongdoing on why I am not worthy.

I am a little fuzzy on the details because this happened about 10 years ago. So during one party in college one of my good friends who was a girl was there and we all drank pretty well and all had a good time. At the end of the night i went to bed seeing has i had to much and decided to end the night for me. Well said girl friend decided to sleep in my bed with me and came in shortly after i had laid down, so not long enough for me to fall asleep. I was feeling pretty frisky and motioned to kiss her when she laid down on my chest.(we had a affectionate albiet platonic friendship) She said no no casually as she new the state i was in. I didn't actually kiss her or attempt anything else and simply went to bed. Well a few hours later i wake up and she is cuddled up against me and I realize i have my hands down her pants. I froze and by then shes awake and she casually takes my hand out and both of us go back to sleep without me doing anything else.

A few weeks go by and she has dinner with my other three roommates and she must have brought it up because one of my roommates asked me about it. I admitted it and didn't talk about it further. A few weeks later i see her at another party and when we crossed paths in the hallway I simply said I am sorry for what i did and she casually and quickly said its ok. I wish i would have said more but i was too embarrassed and ashamed. That was the end of the matter and hadn't really thought about it much. By that point in our college careers and friends groups we drifted apart so there wasn't really a follow up chance to talk. Maybe its me maturing and the scared of my own inadequacies of marriage or even the recent metoo stuff but i have been overcome with extreme guilt and depression over it. I ask myself what if i ruined her life, what if she hates me for it and said it was ok just to get over the situation? I talked with her on facebook a few months back and she talked  normally and congratulated me on marriage and asked how things were going. I've had many other interactions with women since this, drinking and none drinking, and its never been an issue but i feel terrible for being a predator and potentially causing pain. There is no excuse for it but i feel guilty and pissed at my younger self for doing something i did not intend to do or even had any recollection of until i came too and froze.

It was a mistake and now i am drowning deeper into guilt that im starting to not be able to control. Im getting more to the point where I am now questioning everything I have ever did and if there is anything else I did that I am not remembering or choosing not to feel guilty about until now because I am a shitty person. "
DyingI donât think I even wanna die I just want to end the pain and make everything stop. Living is just hurting me and everything is shit
If you have no friends. Whats the pointI enjoy dancing/going out to clubs/dressing up and going to concerts. I always thought my 20s would be filled with these moments. But I never made any friends through university that also enjoyed doing this. I never had a friend group. Just one friend who at most we go out to dinner together. My dad asked my brother behind my back if he thought I was happy. I think everyone has now realized that I'm depressed. I'm turning 24 in February. Life is bleak after college if you don't have any friends. I want to hang myself in my apartment as soon as I return to school this Monday. 
"Mom dying of cancer, I want to die firstMy mom's terminal illness is all I think about. I read about how people are never the same after losing a parent. Life is going to be absolutely miserable. Why would I want to stick around for that? Fuck it, I'm opting out of that misery."
"Beautiful day and I'm miserableIt's gorgeous out and I'm riding my bike. I can't shake this depressing feeling in my chest. I don't want to die anymore, but I think it's inevitable. I don't know where to begin to turn my life around.  "
Its painfulLaying in bed entire day because I have zero motivation to get up. My heart hurts. I'm crying all the time. I'm mentally broken... I dont even have enough motivation to commit suicide. This will last forever I have to end it hopefully I'm able to get enough strength to end it.
Fuck my job fuck my lifeFucking kill me I hate my job and I wanna die because of it but I can't quit I only have 2 weeks left and then I can quit but I don't think I can handle it. Fuck I wanna die so bad but I don't have the guts to kill myself

"I joke about suicide all the time, but I actually want to do it.For the past little while I always make little jokes here and there about how I'm just going to end it all.  I know it makes people uncomfortable, and they do a little half-chuckle where they think I'm just playing around but the subject matter still bothers them.

Thing is I'm not actually joking.  I've wanted to die for a while and literally the only reason I haven't done it is the thought of leaving my GF and parents with the aftermath horrifies me.

I just don't know how much I have left in me.  I think if I did do it I'd rather find a way to do it in a secluded area where I just disappear one day without a word to anyone.  I don't want to be remembered or mourned, I just want to be forgotten about.

"I wonât survive the weekend. Iâm killing myself tonight.I feel so at peace now that Iâve committed to ending my life tonight. Iâve been in so much pain for so long and now I wonât have to face it every day. I wonât have to wake up each morning as this huge disappointment to myself and others. I wonât have to face my abuser day in and day out. Yeah, part of this is hugely selfish, but I hope that everybody who knows me can see how badly I need the pain to stop. 

If anybody out there knows who I am, know that is isnât in any way your fault. Thereâs nothing you could have done to prevent this from happening. I believe that Iâve been depressed my whole life and the weight of it for the past 28 years has been exhausting. I hope you all will be happy to know that Iâm at peace now. Iâm still so sorry."
"Can a young person be really suicidal?This post was inspired by this exchange https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kfpjrv/what_are_the_conditions_for_not_feeling_finegood/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf .

Most calls for help here can be divided in two groups: the younger than 30 years old and the older. Both groups are capable of gulping too many pills, but Iâm wondering to what degree weâre observing very different situations. 

An 11 years old who wants to âkill herselfâ is in pain. The pain is overwhelming and her experience doesnât give her ways to find relief. There may not be relief. In any case, her focus on the pain of the moment makes the potential of a good future completely disappear from her option. So, ok, letâs tell her that we love her and try change her mind.

But a 50 years old is an adult. She went through multiple experiences, the death of her parents, the birth of her son, a good job, a good friendship, an abusive boss, a betrayal. The 50 years old knows what sheâs feeling, sheâs less likely influenced by a road rage episode from that morning. If she wants to die, she must know what sheâs saying.

If we really want to help, our attitude to responding to these two profiles must be very different. We could use white lies with the former, but we donât want to say bullsh*t to the latter and further destroy her already crumbling faith in humanity.

However, most of times, support comes only in the first form, like we were all 11 years old. Are we sure weâre not making more damage than benefit? Personally, with the second category, I believe that empathising is more useful than trying to change their mind. Sharing that Iâm suicidal, too, will make her feel less alone and think twice to her choice.

Any experts among the readers?

Thanks."

"I'm sad, lonely and don't want to be aliveI don't want to live. My life has since I can remember been full of sadness with very few happy moments. I am lonely, I have no friends or colleagues. My best ally is hard music like dubstep or extratone because it makes me forget about life. But it's only temporary. The only reason I'm still alive is my mum, but I secretly wish I could just die in an accident or something I can't prevent. I've cut myself in the past and have had serious suicidal thoughts before. Back then, it got a bit better after I started seeing a psychologist, but now over the years it's been getting worse and worse again. I don't know where to start. I want to have... anybody. But I'm a bad person - not funny, moody, anxious, full of negativity and just quite boring overall. And loneliness is what's killing me."
"Can someone talk too me?I feel like killing myself and I'm listening to music so I'm not really doing anything but thinking about suicide.
EDIT: Nvm I'm just gonna go kill myself"
"Not really sure I have any other optionFirstly, I feel completely stupid even posting here in the first place. I've been thinking about suicide for years and years. I've always had something planned (when I say planned, I mean, something to postpone dying for), a next life event to wait for (holiday, college, moving, etc) but now they're about to run out. I don't know if I would actually kill myself, but I'm convinced that one day I'm going to wake up and realize I should have done it years ago.

See, the thing is, I broke the law (years ago). In a serious way. I was convicted of a very serious crime. It's amazing that I didn't spend any time in prison. If you ask any reasonable person, they'd tell you that I should be in prison now.

But I'm not a bad person. I have excuses as to why I broke the law, and I also don't think that what I was convicted of is truly indicative of what I did, but at the same time I don't think anyone could ever justify what I was a party to.

So now I'm up against a wall. I moved. Changed name. Tried to get on with life. I had a girlfriend who I met after the crime was committed, but before the court proceedings. We stayed together long after it was all over. She knew about it all. We broke up a while ago.

Since moving to the other side of the country I have made new friends, have a new girlfriend, and am at the end of college (2nd time around). My life here is completely separate from my old life, which has my family and old friends. My current girlfriend has never met my family, and it's long past the point at which she should have. I can't continue a relationship with her and not tell her about my past, but if I tell her then we are finished (definitely). Also, by telling her, my friends here will find out, and I will lose them too.

I am about to finish college, and to get any job in my field of study requires a background check.

So this is where I am; friends/partners will never stick around if they know about my past, and I will soon have to face the reality that I am near-unemployable based on my past.

I don't want to die, but I don't want to end up old, pathetic, and lonely.

I've read several times that if you are truly ready for suicide, then you should realise that you are free, and have nothing to lose. I feel like in my situation I have everything to lose (and will lose it), and nothing to gain. This is most likely the high water mark in my life, so I would rather go now, rather than in 20 years time, long after I've had time to muse over my ruined life.

Not sure what I'm expecting. I've never had this discussion (or even breathed a word to another about it) before. Thanks for listening, Reddit."

and im sure if that person ever found out you shared that personal message to others theyâd probably at the very least be uncomfortable, probably even mad. it just feels odd. no hate tho, you can do whatever you want, but i get this feeling like im invading someoneâs privacy when i see a text posted on this sub."
"How to prepare to dieWhat are some things I should take care of before leaving. Obviously wiping my computers and stuff like that, throwing away and giving away a bunch of things.

I'm not looking for reasons why I shouldn't do it, or how life will get better or any other lies like that.

"Hopeless.Nothing Iâve done helps me feel better. Things seem eerie and dark and endless, and Iâm thinking about killing myself probably 100 times a day. Itâs all I can seem to think clearly about, itâs the only thing that seems real or possible. Itâs all I want. I think of all the other things I used to want and it all seems so pointless. Thereâs no joy or relief to be found in anything but sleep, and I canât even do that for more than an hour at a time. Gaming, sometimes, when I can throw myself into a different life. 

I used to vent through art, or writing, but I have no desire for either anymore. I used to read all the time, but I canât focus on anything anymore for more than a minute. Life these days feels like itâs saturated in darkness. 

I mentioned something the other day to my mom. I said that most of the people in our family are depressive, and she said itâs just the blues. I felt offended, but? Maybe itâs true. Because I donât even cry. Itâs easy to step out of my room and be the person that everyone thinks I am. I smile and joke and laugh and clean and cook and play with the dogs and then when I have space I just sit and wait to find the courage to just end it. 

Do people who arenât depressed struggle like this? Do you think about suicide this much? I hear that sometimes itâs okay, because thinking about it is just a coping mechanism. I donât know."
"Does someone else jiggle with their leg when they're nervous? I'm in a new school and so I really dont know anybody, and my social anxiety makes it worse but whenever someone tries to talk to me or sits next to me I get really nervous and my right leg moves up and down really fast. I cant stop it (it goes away after like 30 seconds or sometimes Minutes)and it makes me even more nervous. Is this a normal thing or am I weird.

"Rock bottom is really beginning to feel like home....I don't even know where to start. I genuinely don't care to see tomorrow. In the last year, I've been cheated on by my soon to be ex husband. After a rough night at his work with a 18yr old waitress hitting on him, my now ex best friend told me they'd been cheating for four months. I found out in late February 2020. In the beginning of February, I met someone (I'm polyam/enm) who quickly fueled emotions and feelings inside me I'd never felt before. I'd felt whole for the first time in my 27 years of living. 

Then Covid hit. I decided to stay with him. I couldn't stand to be quarantined with my husband. I spent time on and off in between places. I loved being with my new partner (NP).

Recently, I've really hit a mega depression. I'm financially, mentally, emotionally, and physically failing. I can't seem to keep my head above water. Between financial issues, having DID, severe Complex PTSD, politics, and the common SAD, I can't seem to keep my nose above water. To add on top of it, I feel completely worthless, or of no value. I feel completely unwanted by everyone in my life. Recently found out my grandma blames me for my marriage issues. Found out my other grandma is near her death bed. I can't do this anymore. 

I honestly don't care to see tomorrow. I really don't. I won't do anything and I'm physically safe, but I don't want to be here... I feel so alone... People touch me and I can't feel them. I'm scared."

"Not so urgent collection of thoughtsHello world. This isn't an urgent thing. Disclaimer: The following isn't coherent or structured in any legible way. I'm just a peasant recording my thoughts. Proceed at your own peril.

&amp;#x200B;

I posted here long ago when I was having some issues, mostly because I don't know where else to post these things. I often worry about everything having its right place and inconveniencing others, but then I never actually do anything so I guess I'm being a little lazy and selfish. Folks were open and communicated to me in a very human way and I appreciated that a lot at the time. I am a dark man with an old soul, so I don't often get to talk freely and open. I just don't have the disposition for it. I keep to myself and all my few friends are distant and online. I have been in an self-imposed pseudo-exile for about 15 years now and you tend to develop a deep reservoir for the chaos of life, relationships and everything else. Sometimes that well fills up to the brim, and I'm sort of at that point now. In such times I'm normally okay to ride the waves until the sludge subsides, but not today. Today I need a little catharsis or I might lose a bit of myself that I won't be able to repair.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 31. That's really old to me, mostly because I still feel like a teenager. That's okay and all, but I have a deep seeded preoccupation with mortality. Time is running out. I have to leave my mark before I leave this earth. My field is artwork and has been for 1 year now. Actually, it has always been my weapon of choice, but I wasn't really serious about it throughout my entire 20's. I have always been a slowpoke in life. A slow grower. Slow to choose, slow to move. Just slow. That's fine, but it was always in the back of my head, like a splinter or a light. I wouldn't say it's a calling because I'm not very good, but I enjoy it and it brings me fulfillment in a life that has otherwise lacked all significance. Being slow is relevant to note and that will become apparent later on in my story.

&amp;#x200B;

My life has been a junkyard of failed starts. I don't really fit into the boomers or the millennial or the whatevers that people use to categorize themselves these days. I just sort of exist. Sometimes I feel like a lost soul. I don't value much in this world past integrity and happiness. That's convenient for someone without a real job or experiences to say, I suppose, but it's true and it's a huge part of why I am the way I am. I am as simple as simple gets and as complicated as complicated gets. I'm a real basket-case, as folks over here would say. Back home, we call such people headcases. It isn't so different I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a good school. It was a local school in the country where I lived for 28 years (Ireland). It was an odd school in that it's common for the schools back then to be segregated into one of the two major religions in the north. My school was integrated, which was great. You can consider it a progressive school in that sense and it's reflected in its teaching values. Why do those differences matter? What's I suppose ironic, and this became apparent to me in my later years there, is that political division was instead replaced by economic division. I grew up poor and money would play a huge role in how I developed as a person. The majority of my classmates were extremely wealthy and it reflected in their attitudes. I was in on merit only, you know? They were too, but also wealth. I developed a deep resentment for privilege and entitlement. I stand by it, even today. It's important to remember that we are all the same people. We're all peasants, ultimately. I could go through the list of situations at my school that made me develop such bitterness, but we would be here all day. Entitlement sucks to deal with. Fuck the wealthy.

&amp;#x200B;

I left school early and I have been adrift ever since. I was in and out of CBT for most of my early 20s until I realized that it was time for me to just think my way out of my problems. So I did. Despite being in and out of jobs and in out of education, in my mid 20s I finally completed 2 A levels without quitting. Of course, I fucked up my favourite class (Politics) that I was nailing because I walked out of the last paper in protest of the boring question (essay based on lame-duck presidency aka dry-ass contentless curveball prompt) and disappointed my teacher, but oh well. At least I had 2 A-levels. The problem with this is that I couldn't go to university on just 2 A levels, so there I was adrift again. Around about this time I had just come out of a chaotic relationship that deserves its own paragraph.

&amp;#x200B;

Women have defined a lot of my life. As a man, with pride and a big ego, a man that has toiled for what little he has had throughout his entire existence and is fully prepared to be homeless if it means that I die with my integrity intact, women have defined me. I grew up in a single household with my divorced mother. My father cheated on her and left us in the dirt. She didn't contest any of his military affluence. Fuck him. For all her shortcomings, I will forever love and admire this small part of our story. She just took me and left. This unfortunately made life difficult though. I was a work-baby and almost died of boredom whilst my mother cleaned the houses of the wealthy for a living. I guess that's part of where my resentments come from.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is a force of nature. In many ways she is still a child. When I think of her, I like to think that she raised me until I raised her for the remainder of our time together. I love her and I loathe her. She's great, and she's awful. She is the embodiment of empathy and also so woefully human. I wouldn't know where to start with her, but she had a huge impact on how I developed of course and for the first part of my life our relationship would define how I treated other women too. What you don't hear very often from people in similar situations; it's really hard being the man of a family. Really hard. I spent a lot of my teenage years and adulthood dealing with my mothers boyfriends and their dysfunctional relationships that were often abusive. I wasn't prepared, but I learned valuable lessons. I will never put anyone in that situation nor will I live it myself. Domestic abuse and those environments are maybe the worst things I can think of. There is something perverse about your safe space being corrupted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, women. Of all my girlfriends, the Romanian probably left the biggest impression, topped only by my wife. She was strong, beautiful and smart. Most of all, she wanted me. I flew to Europe to see her and then I flew again. It was a whirlwind of a few years and then it blew up spectacularly. My trip to Romania was maybe the worst experience I have ever had. There is nothing quite like being in a foreign land where you don't speak the language with no allies to hold onto. Something broke in me then. I have had a couple of situations that I would consider breaking points. At those points in your life, you lose a part of yourself. I'm not sure what it is. I can almost hear it snap off. Something important goes down the drain and you can't get it back. 

We fought bitterly, like rabbits. On leaving, I knew that was it. I hadn't accepted it though, so it was still a shock to hear it happen when I got home. What's worse is, it was a couple of months afterwards and there were already plans for me to spend Christmas. What's even worse than that is that I found out our mutual German friend was coming to stay with her in her apartment. You can probably guess what was going on there. I loved her, you know? Sometimes I still stalk her. She's one of the heads of the EU Commission now. Good for her, I guess. Cunt. Anyway, this prompted a pretty steep spiral for me that almost landed me in a mental institution. This is where the second piece of me broke off. 

3 years into my schooling and attempt to champion myself into a better man, with lungs that were about to eject out of my body from the 20 cigarettes a day I was smoking post-breakup, I had finally decided I had had enough and wanted out. I wanted to die. My plan was to go visit my Kiwi friend living in Essex and then wander off in the middle of the night after saying my goodbyes and kill myself in a field. I made the stupid mistake of telling my school counselor that I was seeing for some reason. She freaked out and got me into a lot of bother, but I guess I'm still alive. When I went up to commit myself, they wouldn't take me. They said it wasn't a serious case. They showed me the door at 10pm during winter with no way to get myself home. I was stunned. I sat down against a building on their grounds and held my head. I had nothing and I had no one. I broke then. I only had myself. I realized that. No one gave a fuck. We're all just animals, in the end. The best part was when security came to remove me from the premises. A nice touch. 

&amp;#x200B;

Such is life, I suppose? That's what I told myself. After that, I worked a shitty job for 3 months, quit, and then drifted from crappy relationships to crappy homes and then back to crappy Mums. I did some illegal stuff and I did a whole lot of nothing. I wouldn't call myself a shell of a man, but I developed some pretty dark philosophies. I realized that everything is relative and that everything is just about perspective. I realized that I was the only thing that mattered. I still believe that, to an extent, but as I'm about to get into, I did remove myself from that philosophy to a degree. I still being in the practical easiness of life, where grand super-philosophies hold no precedent and common sense takes over. I consider this a dominant Irishism. The ability to put your bloody torso and maimed limbs to one side to have a laugh about how stupid it all is. If you didn't laugh, you'd cry, right?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm married. I met my wife on here. I met my wife after I posted my rambling nonsense on this very subreddit 4 or 5 years ago now. She's American and I now live in America with her. I have mentioned all of the above for context. My life has been hard and I am the way I am for a reason. I am not a bad man, but I can be a difficult man. I accept that. However, despite this, I have tried my very best to be a better man for my wife. After-all, we are married, right? I have shed a lot of my self-developed ways of dealing with the world so that I can function with another person. I did that for her and I did that with a lot of thought and feeling involved. Now, I am hopelessly vulnerable and as much as I hate it, I recognize that it is healthy too. Sure, whatever. 

The problem is that 2 years ago she cheated on me. It isn't your standard cheating. When I came to visit originally, 6 months after we had decided we wanted to be together and 6 months 2 weeks before we had started talking to each other here on Reddit we had a lovely time. It was just so easy. It just made sense. I felt as if I was waiting for this my whole life. A reward for putting up with so much garbage. Some relief. Some respite. I can't begin to describe to you how happy I was. I really can't. Once you've been through hell and you make it through, it isn't even elation really. It's just fatigue and relief. A great wave of it. Fucking finally.

She got a text message that Christmas from some guy. This guy was from her history and she was still in contact with him. We never really shared our relationships in any great detail and my wife is a little wishy-washy with the nature of her relationships. She is dangerously intelligent and very savvy when it comes to wordplay. It's difficult for me to know what she means when she is guarding herself. We had an argument that Christmas, before I went home and we started the visa proceedings about the nature of this guy. I said, fine, fuck it, I'll let you deal with it and deal with it she did.

One year later I was now in America. I had packed up my whole 28 years of life in the country I love to come here to be with her. It took us a year to get me a drawer to put my clothes, because her job is stressful and life is busy, I guess. That's fine. She left her phone at home one day. I looked at her text messages, because, reasons. There he was near the top. I went through her text messages all the way back to when we were talking about being together and how much of a done and dusted deal it was. She was talking to him about taking him to bed. I was shattered. I paced the house for 6 hours until she came home. 6 hours. I did. I walked for 6 hours. I couldn't sit still or my heart would break. She said it didn't mean what I thought it meant, after she was done being outraged that her husband looked at her phone that is. 

Several months later, I decided that if this were to work, I would need to let it go. We argued a lot during those months. I almost walked out on more than one occasion. It wasn't so much the event that bothered me, although it did basically corrupt any notion of something pure for me, which isn't supposed to happen because fuck me, I guess. It was mostly her reactions afterwards. It was defensive, not apologetic. Even to this day, she is defensive, not apologetic. I can't really get over that. We're 2 years in now and I'm sleeping on the floor. She's at her parents in another state for Christmas. 

We have dealt with death together and done all the married things, but it doesn't seem right. It seems broken. I feel broken and lost. I feel so hopeless in this country that I actually loathe with every fibre of my being. Something else broke off of me during these years. She just doesn't care and if she does, she hides it very well under some very well developed defense mechanisms. Most days I wonder what I'm doing here still and I am definitely wondering that this Christmas. I told her it was fine to go, and it is, but it also isn't. It just isn't as simple as that anymore. Besides my time in Romania, this is the only other time that I have felt so alone. I actually have nothing left. I'm trying not to dwell on it because I might break for good if I do. However, I just wanted to get that off my chest.

We discussed going to marriage counseling because I'm trying not to add to my junkyard and I'm trying to champion myself again, but this one definitely feels like a struggle. The bedroom has been basically dead on arrival with stress cited as reasons. I can't really approach her anymore after those text messages and she doesn't care enough to work on it. Stress only goes so far, you know? I'm a man, and I'm just not getting anything. I'm frustrated. I was working hard on my artwork up until 2 months ago where I just lost all motivation and started sleeping in the other room. She has to sleep with an industrial fan that I have been okay with and understanding for most of our life together, but only under the promise that she would work on it so that we can sleep together. She didn't, of course. So, in order for me to take control of myself once again instead of being passive, I started sleeping elsewhere. I'm glad I did, but it also means that my marriage is basically dead. At least I'm getting sleep. She doesn't care that I'm sleeping in the other room. She's scared of me because I shouted at her during arguments. I actually find it completely absurd that she claims she's scared of me. Absolutely absurd, but everything is perspective, right? To me, it just seems like she's playing victim, though. That's my perspective. So, I just don't discuss anything with her anymore. And that's my life. I sit here and waste time until something happens. Until a meteor lands on my head, I guess. I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I gave up a lot to be here. I have sacrificed a lot in my life to deal with demons that were forced upon me or accidentally summoned by me. I just wanted one pure thing that wasn't anybody elses. Just mine. Me. A reason to be, other than just being for me. I guess I don't even get that and I am doomed to carry the weight of my history and me, forever. I just don't have anything good or anything to look forward to anymore. It's going to be a long Christmas, y'know? Anyway. Thanks for listening, if you got this far. Cheers. Have a good one."
"Screw Politicians Both sides hate us and get paid by corporations for campaign money and then use that to actively vote against us.

Of course, it won't be surprising to know that defense contractions pay for campaigns for some polititions) I siriously wish that any 3rd party would win, just to get the corrupt out of office.

I'm afraid to drive home.My depression is hitting hard today. I'm afraid to drive home because that is an hour of me by myself in a car with just my thoughts. The urge to drive into oncoming traffic or off the road in general is already there. I know it will only get stronger as I get closer to the actual time to go home from work.
"I am not adjusting wellI've never actually posted on Reddit before. I don't post on social media often - I'm insecure. I don't really want people to see me. 

I'm really struggling. Ever since I was a kid, I've had a difficult time handling and regulating my emotions. I haven't actually been diagnosed with anything, although I've been in therapy off and on several times since I was little. I know I am depressed, and I am almost 100% certain I'm also experiencing generalized anxiety disorder. 

I can't function. It seems like every year brings something newer and more difficult without something good in equal weight. I can't pretend that there aren't good things in my life or that I don't have opportunities. I just feel so heavy. All the time.
I started dating my boyfriend a little under a year and a half ago, though we've been friends for over six. He's amazing, he truly is, and I have no idea where I'd be physically, mentally, or emotionally without him. A couple months after we started dating, he confessed that he was struggling with depression (which was ongoing for him, as well) and talked about suicidal thoughts. He didn't have much of a support system where he was going to school and ended up moving back into his mom's house. He has a good relationship for her, but he was basically in the same situation, just a different place. He and I were ""long-distance"" at the time, but could usually see each other twice a month. Every day I would wake up, go to work, go to school, come home and do homework, then talk on the phone with him for hours at a time while we played games together. Video games aren't really my thing, but we found some that we both liked to play, plus it gave us both a way to distract ourselves. Sometimes he would disappear for a day. Sometimes I could tell he was extremely drunk when he texted me. Sometime the things he said didn't make sense at all. He was hurting. It took a toll on me even though I was willing to do anything to help him. It killed me to know the person I loved was hurting and that I couldn't do anything about it.

I was focused on him, but there was still so much else I needed to pay attention to. My longest, truest, best, and most fulfilling friendship fell apart and I don't know if we'll ever be friends again. I moved out of my abusive stepfather's household to a new city with her after I graduated high school - we lived together for nearly four years and were friends for almost six. We weren't mature enough when we were younger to communicate when things were wrong in our relationship, and so neither of us said anything when we were displeased with each other. It built up. We got in arguments about money - she rarely paid rent on time and we were getting shutoff notices from our utilities. I got home one day last January after my first day of the new semester, working, and running errands all over town without a car to find a shutoff notice for the electricity after getting a notice from our landlord the day before. I felt out of control, like I was being overlooked. She didn't seem to care. I couldn't move back in with my parents like she could if we got evicted and couldn't find a new place (which was likely). Something in me snapped, we argued, we stopped talking, she didn't pay, she told me she was moving out, and that was that. We've talked a few times, but I'm still angry. I'm sure she is, too. 

My boyfriend moved in, and things were good for awhile. I finished my last full semester at the community college I was attending with only one summer class left, and with good grades. Our apartment was starting to feel like home, and it was so good to finally have him by my side. His mental health got better. He found a job here that he loves and has been happy and healthy for over seven months now. 

Summer was when my mental health got really bad. I started seeing a therapist again at the end of April. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been helpful, but honestly sometimes I can't focus enough to try to change what I'm thinking or feeling. The only thing that gets me out of my head is distraction, and I'm convinced the buildup just shows up later. If one more person suggests I meditate, I swear to God...anyway. ALL of my friends moved away, aside from the friendship that fell apart. So now I am mostly alone and feeling guilty for putting my mental illness on no one but my boyfriend. I started at a four-year university this semester, and I am not adjusting to it. I feel out of place, I feel weird, I feel unfocused and less ambitious and driven than them. I'm intelligent, but I can't focus on anything anymore. I'm so tired all the time. I'm only taking 11 credits but I feel like I'm constantly dragging my feet. I was working 30 hours a week, managing the coffee shop where I met all of my friends that I made here. I had to quit, I just couldn't do it anymore. In retrospect, I left one of the only safe places I had left, no matter how much it stressed me out. 
Suicide is always at the back of my mind. I haven't talked to anyone about it, not even my counselor. I'm scared to give up any freedom I have by admitting I have these thoughts. I haven't told my boyfriend, but I'm almost certain that he knows. He called off work the other day because I was in such bad shape and knew I needed someone to be with me. Sometimes it doesn't even come from a particular stressor. Sometimes it just starts - I feel heavy and my throat swells up, and I cry all the time. I cry so much. I can't stop. I hate being in public, especially at school. I don't know how to move or how to interact with people. I'm so tired. No one I talk to understands. I can't make myself understood. 
I don't think I'm going to kill myself. I've made it through hard times before, although they didn't last this long and weren't as intense. I'm going to Planned Parenthood to change my birth control method next week, which I'm praying is going to help. I have to find a new counselor because mine is no longer going to be counseling. If I'm still having trouble after being off the pill for awhile, I'm going to ask for a prescription. I need to be out of this hole. I need to be lighter. I need to find some sort of light in the world again."

"It's my brother's ducking cake day party.And I'm in my room, being depressed af and googling about the exit bag.

I know, I'm still far away from actually committing suicide, but I still want to get this off my chest.

I've been depressed since I was 12 years old (I'm currently 16), but I'm not constantly sad. I experience depression more in like.. phases. Sometimes I'm really happy and cheerful and then (after a few days/weeks/months) I'm suddenly too sad to function normally because of no particular reason.

It is really hard for me because I never know when the next phase is going start and there are no reasons why they start. 

In school, I'm known to be the happy lovey-dovey kid that always laughs and smiles, that's why I'm too scared to actually talk with someone about how I feel. Some of my friends do know that I used to be depressed, but I'm too much of a chicken to tell them that I still am and that it is getting worse again.

I should be happy, I don't have any problems in my life. I don't have the right to feel this way and get help from others. I don't even have the guts to properly talk about it with my boyfriend (he is probably going to read this post tho, but I hope he doesn't) Speaking of my boyfriend, I think he loves me because I'm always so happy (at least in in his eyes) and I can't bring myself to ruin the way he sees me. If I told him what I actually feel, he would probably be sad and maybe even disappointed. Still, I wish I could just tell him everything that is going on in my head, it would help me a lot. 

I'm even too afraid to ask my parents if I can take more therapy sessions, because I just can't admit that I'm still depressed. 

At this point I'm just asking myself why I'm still alive, even though I hate myself this much. 

Sorry for wasting your time with this long text, I just needed to let it all out in one way or another."
"I don't know what to do in life, and I just want to end it.Hi. Title really says it all. I'm starting my sophomore year in high school and I used to have a clue as to what I want to be in life, but I'm starting now to realize that it is impossible for me. My step father pushes me to be the best version of my self but I just don't want to continue. I get good grades in school and I excel in sports, but every single time it's never enough for him. I'm afraid of going downstairs for the reason of being yelled at every single time. 

He'll always figure something out to just lash out at me, and I can't take it anymore. I really want to leave and just not have to deal with him. Everything I do is always below his expectations for me and I always get yelled at because of it. I do everything by the book and how he wants me to do it but he finds a way to insult me and say that it's pathetic. When I try to explain that I feel bad that day or sick, he shrugs it off and says that it's pointless and that since I am a child I should not feel tired or bored. 

I know this sounds pathetic because this issue is not as serious as everyone else's, but I have had these thoughts for a couple of years now, because of him. I've researched how to buy cyanide pills, and all I have to do is earn some money to buy them. It's pathetic though, I am on a foundation for success yet I don't feel any of it. I'm constantly reminded that when I feel satisfied, that it's worthless and amounts to nothing, and that I have to do even more. I just get so so tired of doing more all the time. I'm expending myself, I get pains in my legs because of all the extracurricular activities I have to do in order for my step father to feel proud of me. Everything I do is just unacceptable to him."

"'If I'm to slip beneath the train ment to take me, know that I believe that it was worth it.'Song lyrics from 'if im to die' by Keaton Henson. I'm obviously not creative or talented enough to think of such lyrics.

I think the song is about how death is inevitable, love and falling out of love. I'll never get the chance to experience that, the love part of course. I think I've accepted that now."
"TIFU by accidentally saying something rude to my aunt So this happened not even 5 minutes ago, and I'm fucking *reeling* -

Me and my parents were in a virtual meeting with our extended family members for Thanksgiving, and when it came time for us to go, I was going to say ""goodbye"" to my aunt, but my dumbass brain decided to say something else. 

You see, I'm autistic and while my family members do know this, sometimes I can accidentally do things that are very rude without meaning too because of it. However, what I said was very uncharacteristic because normally I'm not this rude when I am accidentally rude, but I digress;

My aunt was about to log off the video chat, and I decided to make a joke so I said ""wait, who are you again?"" and I was going to follow it up with something else but after I said that I froze after I realized what I had just said and then my aunt hung up. 

So naturally, I was upset asf after realizing how rude I was, so I ended up cussing up a storm which only pissed my stepdad off even more however he ended up comforting me but not even TWO SECONDS after I exited the room, he went to go talk to my mother and say that I was stupid asf and tell her about what I had said to my aunt before she left. 

And then my mom was also like wtf and then I realized the magnitude of what I had just done, as my aunt is a major narcissist and would most definitely use it against me, *ESPECIALLY* my parents. 

So I went and apologized to my aunt, and she said it was fine and so did my dad, given that he said had my aunt actually heard it she would've been blowing up my parent's phones, and I'm sure she hasn't either but now my stepdad thinks I'm fucking stupid and so does my mother and now I want to go curl up into a ball and jump off a cliff into a pit of hellfire. :D

TL;DR: Accidentally said something rude asf to my narcissistic aunt and mild chaos insued."

"I'm tired and afraid of having to push through life when I know ill kill myself eventually. Now's as good a time as any.I've been an underachiever for most of my life and I've come to regret it more and more deeply throughout the years. Everyone around me has always believed in my potential and my capability, my teachers, my friends, and my family. But really im useless. From the age of nine until the age im at right now which is 25, ive been addicted to computer games. I live in a country where the youth graduate college at 21. Now two of my siblings are doctors and one is a lawyer. Meanwhile I've been in 5 different colleges, caused a car accident, got drunk enough to wake up in an I.C.U. and am still living purely on my parents' purses and good will. Throughout all of this, the most effort I've ever put into are two relationships. One that lasted two years in which the girl left me because she frankly didnt think I'd amount to much. The other one is with Marie. I love Marie more than anything. And I like to think she loves me too just as much. And everything is so much brighter with her.  But Marie has her issues too. And sometimes she hurts me. She bites and hits me hard and she eggs me on to hit her too. I don't. Somehow after all of that she cries. And its my fault. Sometimes the crazy becomes too much that on impulse we break up. But we always get  back together within the week. It happened again recently. Now she tells me that we should stay broken up. She tells me that I deserve someone better. And then she tells me she doesnt forgive me for leaving her. And no matter what I say I can't get her to change her mind. Now I'm awfully depressed. And i just think that im so weak. I've wasted so many opportunities in my life and I've disappointed everyone I know. Now it all just feels like shit. And I want to die. Im tired. Im afraid. I just want to die now. "

"I'm not depressed I'm angryMy suicidal thoughts have evolved from being depressed to just being anger towards life. It's not the same as when your sad . This is much darker. I could never harm a soul. But I don't know how to continue to go on. I turn 21 on 9/14 . Life is just starting but is it honestly worthit? I can't control my feelings anymore I just want people to support me/my actions I feel like I have nothing to live for.
 I recently been able to distract myself with a couple of hobbies but the thoughts are still there. I need people to talk to. Anyone "
Iâm 2 years in Reddit! :) woohoo! I came to celebrate in my favorite sub
"Iâve tried to reach outI have tried countless times telling friends that Iâm not happy and havenât been for a long time. I have had suicidal thoughts for about 5 months and like a month or two ago told my best friend that I wanted to kill myself. All he said was kinda âouch.... Idk what to sayâ but not really put like that. He just said thatâs not good. Birthday was a week ago. Not one of them said happy birthday to me. Iâll never find the girl that I need to pop in my life. I gave up a few years ago trying to get with girls. Always rejected, called ew and just never gonna try again. Iâm so broken dude and nobody cares. I hid it for 11 months before anybody knew, and even when I tried to open up they just donât care. Fuck."
"Silence wench I just wanna be happy Dude I don't want a boyfriend I just wanna hangout with my friends. Over break I've literally just sat around and done nothing all day. 

To top the shittiness my friend literally called me and talked to five minutes about how great his break was and then left to go hang out with his friends(it's a guy's sleepover lol he didn't intentionally leave me out). I'm so tired of trying to make plans with people and nobody is reciprocating. 

Anybody else got the same lonely vibes?"

"2nd time postingHi everyone. This is my second time posting and Iâm honestly surprised Iâm even here to make it. Itâs my 20th birthday today. I have a severe case of strep throat. Today I woke up feeling better than I had in a few days. Less achy and sore. My mom was wonderful and make me my favorite breakfast and the Chiefs won. I still feel empty. I went to watch Netflix in the other room and my mom makes a comment about putting my dog down. I visit my grandma and grandpa because theyâre my favorite people on earth. I help her write an email and I feel needed but still so empty. I love her. I stay so late at her house that I canât make it to my home at college so I have to create an outfit for dinner in what I have at home and I donât like it. I have to do my hair and makeup with whatâs there too. I came home in a hurry after I got found out I was sick. My mom and dad leave before me to get a table at the restaurant for all of us. Iâm running very late. I get in my car to find my gas light is on because, even though I just got it this week, thereâs a problem and my dad needed to look at it. So my mom drove it to and from work and for any errands she needs. I have to fill it up at the scary gas station and get stared down by a scary man. But Iâm not scared. Iâm hoping heâll do something bad. I drive all the way to my college town and pick up my two friends. One of whom is very sweet and says âoh I totally understand why youâre lateâ and the other continues to make comments about me being incapable of being on time to anything. We go to dinner and I try to talk but in crowds I shut down. Nothing I have to say is worth anything anyway. My friends talk more to each other than me. After we all leave my friends continue to talk to each other more and more. They even decide to take the dog on a walk without me because theyâve my throat hurts and I wouldnât want to come. They yell up at me that I need to move my car for a neighbor and I leave. They do not text me. They do not call. They do not ask where I went or why I went there. I finally text one of them to explain and she responds with sheâs sorry but she stays. I continue to explain and she continues to stay where she is. On my birthday with a friend I introduced her to. I finally explode in a long winded text about how itâs happened to me many times that I introduce friends and then get kicked out. I tell her that her âI love youâ and her âIâm sorryâ doesnât mean anything because sheâs still doing the thing sheâs âsorryâ for. I am now selfish because I donât want them to hang out without me. I texted my mom about this. She hasnât respond. All of this proves to me I have no one. My grandma couldnât wait to talk about my cousins. Or my brotherâs girlfriend. Or why donât I have a boyfriend. I chose the restaurant because my friend is celiac and she can eat their food. But I am a doormat. I do not matter. I am empty. There are moments when a flame flickers inside me but not for long before someone or something puts it out. I am 20. I have fought for 20 years. I do not want to fight for 20 more. Or 10 more. Or even another day. Iâve made it to 20 and I can say it really doesnât get better."
"The fragile boys of my old highschool There were a couple of guys at my old highschool who were very hypocrite and annoying. They liked to hit and squeeze people in their necks with their cold and wet fingers, so one break I had enough of being hit in my neck or one of my friends getting her neck squeezed so I hid myself between some sophomores and started moving my hand around the bicep of one of those guys (Damn actually ð) and because of that they started gossiping about that was somehow in love with him and they started giving me a disgusted look. Now do they know how it feels when someone touches you without permission."
"I'm visiting my suicide site tomorrow!My parents have this very small extra apartment with a small bathroom that I decided will be my final location. I'm borrowing keys for it under the pretense that I'm gonna check on the bills and mail but really, I'm surveying the bathroom. On my way there, I'm gonna buy duct tape, plastic wrapping, rubber, etc to plan out how to make it airtight for my charcoal suicide. I am excited and nervous as fuck, I don't know if I'm gonna chicken out again but at least this is a first step to what I want. I really hope a few weeks (or couple of months, depending on how long I'll chicken out), I'll be successful.


I'm fairly sure about the process but if you have extra tips on how to make it more foolproof, hit me up!"
"Nothing I do makes me happy anymore I'm not in the mood to play video games, everything on YouTube I get bored of after 1-2 mins, I dont even have the motivation to finish a drawing. Life just seems so bland now and idk why. I wanna listen to music, I have ~3k songs in my playlist and I'm sick of every single one of them. I dont have the energy to talk to any of my friends.

I just feel numb and empty."
"Don't know what to doOver the past week my mind has been in turmoil, I just can't seem to shake the idea that I would be so much better off not existing. I don't sleep because my mind is so active trying to think of the best way to kill myself, and when I manage to get a bit of sleep my dreams are all horribly violent scenes of my death. 
I keep wanting to talk to someone but I know I'm a burden to everyone around me so there's no way they'd want to hear what I have to say. Every day I have to force myself to get out of bed and go about the day but my thoughts leech into everything I do. 
I looked into counselling at my university but it has at least a 5 day wait until they get back to you and I'm scared of what will happen between now and then. I really don't know what to do. "
"Iâm slowly going insane Been doing online school for a year. All I know is wake up, smoke a bowl, get on a game, smoke another bowl, etc. etc. until the day ends. I havenât talked to anyone in a long ass time, and my social anxiety is crippling when I try to. Iâve gotten taller (6â2) without gaining weight so I look like a Holocaust survivor or some shit. Iâve got a lot of shit to work through but the loneliness is the worst of it. Itâs a cycle of being too anxious to even talk to someone, but hating myself for being alone. Iâm an Instagram addict but scrolling through that shit sometimes really highlights how lonely my life is. Not trying to get too heavy on the fucking teenagers subreddit of all places but sometimes I just need to vent and I thought maybe someone my age could relate."

"School just makes me want to kill myselfI canât fucking do math. I canât. Itâs literally impossible. So instead of trying to help students, schools just punish the students who donât know how the fuck polynomials work (like me). The only thing school has taught me is that Iâm the reason I canât do math and I should just get rid of the problem.

And the stuff I am good at (mainly drumming) gets taken away when I fail a class, so I canât even do that. All of the problems in my life are my fault."
"It breaks my heart to see so many young people feeling suicidal hereNo 12 y/o or 14 y/o should have to feel this way. Iâm so sorry to all the kids out there stuck in this cruel life of pain. I genuinely hope you find a way out of this.

Itâs too late for some of us, but maybe it isnât for you"
"Lets see if I make it to 20.Where do I even begin... I'll (17F) try not to bore you with details about everything but I've been depressed for the past two and a half years (brought on by the death of my father). I didn't tell a single person until this year, when I told a doctor and started getting help. Recently I told my mom and my tutor at school, also a friend from my class. 

I can't talk about depression. My mom was standing there trying to get me to open up and I was just giving her one worded answers, barely getting my words out and avoiding eye contact the whole time. Then she said something that just hit me I guess, because the next thing I knew I was full on sobbing in her arms (like that kind of crying where you cant even speak, keep hicupping, breathing weird, runny nose). She said everything she could to comfort me, then after that ended I just felt awkward around her again. Like i'd shown too much of myself, even though shes my mom and is like the one person I should be really open with. 

My family think I'm a freak. They really do. I act so strange around my extended family, probably from not knowing them very well and not wanting to make a bad impression, which I usually end up doing because I'm so such a backwards idiot. This has gotten so much worse since my father died, not sure exactly why. You're probably reading this thinking I'm over-reacting, I'm not. I act like a fucking idiot in front of my family, I say stupid things, react inappropriately to situations I'm not comfortable with. 

I'm weird around guys. I don't mean just because I'm a straight girl and I'm shy around people I'm attracted to. (Well I am, but thats a story for another day). I've been like this for as long as I can remember, before I even developed attraction to the opposite sex, being around most men/boys I felt like I had to...sort of prove myself to them? It's like I search for validation when I'm talking to guys but with girls its completely relaxed and normal. With girls, I don't feel the need to make them like me. (Strongly feel like this is linked to my relationship with my parents).

Theres a few more reasons why I don't feel like existing anymore but these are some of the main ones, *some*. I get suicidal thoughts in waves throughout the day, some massive and some a little smaller but painful none the less. At the moment, in my sleep deprived state, I see the way I'm feeling at the moment as drowning. Foot caught on a plant on the bottom of the river so no chance of swimming back up to the surface at this point, though occasionally I manage to get high enough to breathe in a bit of air, feeling the sunlight warm on my face, before being sucked back in and reminded that people like me dont belong under the sun, we have a place at the bottom of the river, where nobody has to see us. 

To put it bluntly I seriously doubt I'll still be here to see my 19th birthday...maybe not even my 18th. The only thing keeping me around is the thought of my mom having to deal with my death but thats not always enough to keep me from planning it.

"I've never been this close before.I... I'm new to this. I've had suicidal thoughts when I was younger but this is the only time I've ever really been driven to almost doing it. My mother is the absolute WORST with politics, so anytime someone tries to have a conversation with her she blows up on them and then drags my dad into it. 

My brother tried to ask her something about Bernie or some shit and she went on an unrelated rant about corona virus and then I tried to mediate like a dumbass and I was screamed at as well.

She and Dad and my brother got into a pissing match and I escaped to the basement to cry it out. But then she came down and told me how worthless and selfish and high and mighty I am and brought up my inability to find work and my own place. It just.... This whole thing is the last straw. This isn't even the first time she made us all bolt because she was in some fucking fit.

I have my athame, I have all of my brothers weapons. I'm so fucking close to doing it just so I don't have to be here anymore. I've wanted to die since I was 12 and now at 20 I may actually go through with it."
"I hope I don't break any rules with this  

Hello, Iâm here to tell you about the step I took away from suicide. I hide it reasonably well in my life so I canât really share the good news with anyone.  Iâm a med student in his last year, near the exit in both senses. I have struggled with anxiety and depression for a long time and high pressure didnât really help. I lost total of 3.5 years during my education. From outside I look perfectly well and I have ridiculous amount of trust from everyone I know. I have been entrusted things that no one in my age should be at times since childhood. For med school, they reacted to my every failure that something must have happened, I must have done everything I could, proffesor must have failed me on purposeâ¦ etc. Me being anything less than perfectly fine in any situation doesnât seem to be considered. It really took it's toll for quite a while.



So I finally had enough and said I have one more chance, no more. Only one more chance to betray expectations, only one more chance to betray their support. I put together a travel bag. In the bag I had 3 methods I could use to commit suicide and enough money to travel if I want to do it somewhere away. I had access to so much information on case reports, forensic medicine lectures, autophsies of successful attempts etcâ¦ I settled for 1 general way and two medical drugs of my choices, working at a hospital made it easy to get acquire them. So, I prepared that bag and carried to every single oral exams I had in front of professors. It was unhealthy but also calming to always have an option. Every month I opened the bag and checked the valvesâs pressure against leak, checked the drugs for expiration or heat-moisture damage. I felt relieved when everything checked out. Then I would put it back only to check it open it a month later. During this time I manage to get through without failing so the bag stayed unused.    



Good news I want to share is that at the beginning of this month, I threw the bag away and destroyed everything inside apart from the money. I think that I can contiunue without having it as a cructh. Sorry for writing here to brag about it but I really have no one to tell about it. I'm not completely free of suicidal ideation, I still think about it everyday but I'm safer without that bag. Also sorry fort he long text I didnât know how to cut it down to managable size. Also sorry about the possible grammer mistakes, english is not my natice tongue. Also sorry for being a coward and writing this with a throwaway account."
"I feel like Iâve already sabotaged my own dreams and thereâs no point in living out the rest of my pathetic life.Hey there. Iâm 22. Iâm married. I have had depression and anxiety since I was 14. Every November it gets almost unbearable as itâs the anniversary of my first suicide attempt when I was 15. Iâve let depression run my life and Iâve lived in fear. Iâve blown my aspirations and dreams (donât really want to go into specifics, but there isnât really anyway around it). I donât feel like there is any other reason left for me to be alive. Iâm sick of playing the game and faking it. I literally hope I get killed in a car wreck every time I drive anywhere. The only reason I donât act on it is because I know my husband would blame himself and I love him way too much to leave him with that burden. My future is pretty much what I never wanted for myself. Iâve had counseling. Iâve been on meds. It all just makes me feel numb and dead. Sometimes I like the pain better. "

I can't run, I can't go in the water, I haven't been at the beach in years, I can't do half if not three quarters of the things that  I want to do.
My dream to join the army was crushed because of having a prosthetic. Every time I gave out my heart it was stabbed and abused. Had surgeries where I lost count on how many I had to get on my leg. Last one needed more Skin, so part of it was taken from my left side which one looks like a Shark took a bite out of me. My friends don't hang out with me anymore, all of my exes left me after I gave everything to them. I am just tired of it all.

i dont cae about my marks or my future, because at the end i will die, and even if my future is bleak i can just kill myself

i sometimes feel like nothing really matters since i can kill myself whenever i want to, of course the process in itself is hard, but there are many painless ways to pass."
"I'm feeling ill and it's getting worse for each dayHi, I guess... I don't know how to do this. I posted in depression but maybe I should've posted here...?

I've been depressed for nearly 6 years now, and you know it has been worse (suicidal) and slightly better. There was a time for a couple months I thought that maybe life was worth living but it came crashing down again. And I can't realy blame myself, I wasn't worth enough to have such feelings. I don't think I ever was.

So I guess when reflecting and talking to my sister we had a pretty sad childhood and got lots of problems still lingering from it. And one of my firends when we were out at a pub, he's been my friend for like 12 years now, he said about my father ""I can understand why he remaried with someone with children, cause he knew he'd fucked up with you and wanted to try/start over again"". And I guess that is true cause all he did was to put my sister and I infront of the TV or computer. Though my mother wasn't that good either she put me infront of a book (good, made me scary litterate as a kid) but she always had a bad temper. Like a hellish scream I never heard before. And she's very controlling. So that wasn't that great either. Both had to work alot to get things going for them so I guess I didn't really spend that much quality time with my family. So I waited for my time to leave and then moved out, and today I try to never visit home because I always feel bad when I'm there.

And I have been kinda suicidal lately. I remember someone asked me if I was ok and only slept bad. I kinda then proceeded to do as I always do and push those asking away. I don't want to and actually would like to talk with that person about how I feel but I think it's not right. I think I will try and talk with her about something but I don't know how to ask...

How should I bring it up that I want to talk about something? Should I do that? Won't they be bothered and worried which is worse than not knowing? Worse than to be surprised than me taking my life, and not knowing or believing that they could or would do anything. Is it right to burden others with the weight of your thoughts? Especially since you meet them and word could spread?

I wish I could cry in front of someone and be hugged. I wish I could talk to my friend and tell her how I feel and that I need someone to talk to, but I'm not quite sure she could take it or help me. Is it ok to talk to someone? Is it ok to share what I feel like, looking for some sort of comfort? Can I find comfort in this by talking or will I just ruin everything and risk having her never talk to me again, can I risk talking to anyone about this? Is it right of me to press something on someone, is it right to ever make someone possibly feel what I am feeling and my suicidal thoughts?"
"Laughing at the thought of finally ending my misery (TW)I think I try to be optimistic, maybe Iâm lying to myself. Doesnât matter. I think Iâm happy in my misery, maybe thatâs why Iâm laughing. I want to mutilate myself but thatâs kind of an inconvenience if Iâm still alive and end up in the hospital. I really do wanna live though, thatâs why itâs so fucking funny.

Gave up on LifeIt all started when my mom and her fiance broke up and I quit the cello. Later I developed a bad picking habit and ruined my skin. Now I'm a 30 year old loser and want to kill myself. I'm thinking about trying again. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. No therapy or medication is helping. I feel like its my fault my parents arent doing well. Just wish id die already nothing helps me anymore. My life has been over because of my scarring.

"I really, really, really feel like I'm just ready to die and go home.For the past, few days, really - no, scratch that, ever since this morning,when I woke up this morning, I felt this strong, strong, strong feeling of ""goddamn it, I don't want to be here anymore."" That feeling has stayed with me all day - ALL day. I'm a high school graduated, failed five hundred times over filmmaker with no family except my mother, who never really recognizes my sadness and I have no friends, my mom and I are poor and we live in a shelter, meanwhile in a shelter, I managed to get together an investment prospectus for one hell of a good damn psychological thriller film that I had hoped to direct, a prospectus that had a solid plan for investors - but what happens? It goes absolutely nowhere - **at all** because no one - **no one** wants to give me a chance.

Furthermore, all of my mom and I's family and the ones we did love and care about are all dead and so....I feel like I'm ready to go home. Life isn't going to get better for me because no matter how many times I keep asking the universe, mother goddess - people, to please give me a chance as a filmmaker, the only dream I've had since I was ten, it's just not going to happen. 

All I ever wanted to do was be like my inspirations, my idols, Dallas Roberts, John Krasinski or A.Z. Kelsey or Mark Duplass, but what am I? A thirty-five year old, sheltered, female failure, a loser. So what's the point in going on? In living? I'm very, very, very serious, this feeling of wanting to just end it all is so, so, so strong that I can feel it like an adrenaline rush throughout me. I really don't see any hope or future for tomorrow for me or for my mom, but my mom can make it without me, so I'm just ready to die and go home. I've heard about the afterlife and how beautiful it is in the many, upper dimensional planes, so what am I doing staying here? When no goal that I have, I will never reach? 

I don't even know why I'm posting this here because no one probably gives a shit, but I just felt the pleading urge to express this to someone, because right now, I don't care how it happened, I just wished that I wouldn't live to see tomorrow - another day of losses and failure."
"I feel so stupidUp until a few months ago I [25] had never loved another person in a romantic sense. I had gone on a few dates, but never actually dated someone in any serious fashion. I ended up befriending a woman online about 7 months and it progressed to her admitting she was falling for me. I was naive and inexperienced and after a while I began to feel the same feelings that she had. We would spend hours together every night on skype, watching documentaries or learning about each other. She turned into the best part of my day. I couldn't wait to wake up and read what she had texted me while I was sleeping. It was like a little present every morning. She was visiting her parents nearby after we had been dating online for 5-6 months and she really wanted to see me. She ended up visiting me 3 different times during her trip and sleeping over twice. We meshed so well together, I have NEVER felt more comfortable around another human being. Not even my family. After returning all she could talk about was how amazing the trip was, and how much she loved me. Again we'd spend our nights talking to each other, about our childhoods and dreams, about music and art and food. I could talk to her forever about anything. I wanted to see her again so badly that we worked out a great time for her to visit a month after her first time seeing me in real life. I flew her out to my place again and we spent 4 amazing days together. We hiked and cooked and made love. We would spend hours in bed just wrapped up in each others embrace. I have never felt that level of intimacy with anyone. It took a good deal of effort for her to pull herself off me and board her flight home. After she gets home shes incredibly distant. She tells me that she spent 3 days in her room just burned out on human interaction, not wanting to even see her roommates. Every night shes too tired to skype, or has plans. I sense something is wrong so I confronted her about it. She says after she got home she felt like she didn't love me anymore. That she had ""OD'd"" on me during our trip. She explained that she had hoped her feelings would return to normal but two weeks later theres no change. It was like a fucking light switch. I don't understand the chain of events that went into play. How can someone do a complete 180 turn on me in the span of a day? It's really been weighing on my self-esteem how someone could just throw me away like that. At what point in the future is the next person I love going to do the same? I just keep analyzing it in my head, what I did or didn't do, if I was too boring, if I wasn't funny or charming enough. I can't understand why she doesn't love me anymore. I'm starting to fear that I have fallen down into a place I don't have the strength to pull myself out of."

"I think we saved a life todayI guess this post is the result of my life since the age of 13 to now (30) finally manifesting into something.

I made a transgender friend a couple hours away who's situation was so absolutely horrible (ex left saying they were going to job interview). In reality the car broke down and he was a coward (she is a Lyft/Uber driver so her source of income drive up.

I've myself been very, very close to the edge back in 2011 and was probably days away from throwing in the towel when I had a drug related seizure and my family finally agreed to help.

This person I met, though she never said so, were so close. Something told me I needed to pack up with my wife and go visit them. I'm not religious but there was some inner voice telling me. If there us a God that was him.

My wife, being an amazing woman supported this decision and came with me even though she was sketched out..

What we found was a situation so heart breaking that I am sure the only thing keeping this woman alive was her cat.


Before I continue I should explain my background. When I was 13 my grandfather shot himself. I still remember the cold way my dad ""informed me"" that my grandfather was dead. When I asked what happened he told me ""he shot himself"" and walked away. I really believe when someone takes their life it takes a little piece of everyone in their life. My entire life I've sags felt partly responsible for it.

When I was 18 my mother attempted and came very close. Thank god my dad was suspicious and kicked in the door. She came pretty close to dying.



So I met this girl with my wife and it was the saddest story I've ever heard. He boyfriend of 2 years said he was going to a job interview after their car broke down and never came back. She told me other things I can't share except to sat she's had a hard life. Now living in the country in apartment lacking anything othe than a table, mattress and a few othe things.

She never talked about suicide but I know for sure if not for her cat she wouldn't be here. I know it.

So we told her to leave it all behind. And start fresh with us as a roommate in Fort Lauderdale.

She was reluctant because she didn't want to lose the apartment but I told her the reality she needed to hear.

So she will be moving in with us and I told her it's a fresh start.


I am convinced that if id blown her off or changed plans she might have said fuck it and given up.

The worst thing was her telling me her greatest fear of dying in apartment alone where she would be discovered along with her cat, decomposing.

Me and my wife had to pulln over because we got emotional and that is when I told her about my grandfather and we cried about that.

So the point I'm making is that we must look out for each other in this life and not ignore that inner voice that tells us something us wrong.

If we can all all help even 1 person off the ledge nothing else we do can compare."

"Is it wrong to think I belong in the dark?I feel like I cant look at things without feeling bad about them. Like theyâre painfully alive and I just donât know how to approach them. Like objects and colors. When I close my eyes in the dark, I feel like I belong to that space for eternity and feel at peace. I feel trapped by this world. I can feel something is there that is suffocating me. All these expectations and responsibilities that I cannot shake. 
All these people who no longer care about me but yet their ghosts haunt me with their words and expressions, expecting and waiting for me to be real to them.

I feel like I need to die"
"I feel like there no point in me existing anymoreI grew up feeling no love or affection from my family. Recently found out that the person who I thought was my mother is someone else. My real mom was in my life at some point but was posing as someone else (and is no longer in my life), and I have no clue who my dad is. 

I grew up suppressing my feelings and emotions and was never allowed to express myself. And now I feel like a prisoner in my own head, sometimes feeling like I can never get out. I have a huge hole in my heart that can never be fulfilled, from a love that I never received. 

So whatâs the point, whatâs the point of existing when it feels like I have no one? When it feels like this pain can never be healed?"

Iâm at the pharmacy waiting for my anti-depressants, but only because thatâs what youâre supposed to do, right? Care? Itâs just going to prolong this hopelessness and helplessness Iâm feeling. 
I donât want to die, but Iâm so tired of life. Nothing good ever happens. I miss drugs. Iâm tired of feeling. I want to be numb. 
Iâve never tried hard drugs but today I was thinking maybe going to NA and asking someone for their dealerâa number and OD on several things, hoping itâll be fast and painless. 
But Iâm not there, at least not yet. Iâm close though, thatâs why I came for the meds.

"My experience I shared on other subreddits 2 months agoThis is my story, it happened on valentines day.  


 ""Two nights ago, I commited suicide. I took 10 pills, swallowed them and  went to sleep. I simply cant handle it anymore, I need money I cant get,  pressure from all sides is great so I went with that. Those pills are  potent, only one pill almost killed my day when he took it by accident.  Anyway, I woke up in the morning like nothing happened, at the time I  usually wake up. I didnt have explanation what happened, and I was  disappointed that I'm still alive. I checked the pill case, I indeed  took them. My body felt normal. I got up and took 3 more and sat there,  waiting for them to start working. But no, nothing happened, and still  I'm here. Something is keeping me here, something doesn't allow me to  go. But, in a small chain of events, I managed to borrow the money I  needed and took care of that problem for time being. I still need it but  I will find ways to get it somehow since suicide is no longer an  option. """
"I took a break from Reddit, and hereâs what I learned! I canât survive without Reddit"
"Iraq vet and lost sense in moving forward.Hello, in 28, alone, veteran, and in debt to my parents. It all started when I was in High school, specifically freshman - Senior year. I didn't do well academically, had a GPA of 3.1, the science grades took it down a lot. My parents, specifically my dad, would make a list of things I owe and they've spent on me since grammar school. Each year they send me a paper saying that I owe ~$30,500. This included after school activities, tutoring, oral and medical treatments, auto &amp; car, phone, etc. If I don't pay, they will sue. At end they say that ""I'm not worth the money"" also ""I wish I could spend on something better than you"". Join the Marines after high school because I didn't get accepted into any good colleges and that I could get support after. During my time in Iraq (2009-2011) I got no contact from home, parents didn't even bother sending me letters or calling me. I remember when Christmas came, we got to go home for 3 months. I went home, and I knew I am not welcomed, when my parents are not home just to get my stuff and leave. I remember getting my car and lived in motels or with friends for the rest of the time, spending most on my salary on McDonalds food, cigarettes, and gas. This was the time when my PTSD started coming, I would be more agitated, sad, mixed emotions. Now I live alone, in college, and they keep sending the letter telling me what I owe, I hang it up on the fridge so when I look at it I realize how much of a disappointment I am. I currently work in 3 jobs, working at a marble counter company on weekdays, working blue collar on weekends, meanwhile I take nightshifts doing security. and attending classes. I'm miserable, and I want to end it, I am hungry, bills are piling up, all I feel is hate. "
"Had my first car crash today... (16F)The last couple of days have been really screwed up for me, from failing a test I took days to study for and getting my first B to this today (amongst other things). Iâm sorry to anyone reading this, I know this sounds trivial and other people have real issues on this sub, but I didnât know where else to put this. Iâve been feeling extremely stupid for the last couple of hours because the crash was completely avoidable. A car drifted into my lane while I was driving with my mom and I panicked (I have bad anxiety) and swerved to prevent an accident and crashed into some trees. The other driver kept going with no damage. I feel incredibly dumb and embarrassed, I wasted the police and emtâs time (I wasnât injured, although I feel like I deserve to be), and I couldâve hurt my mom. My parents arenât mad at me and know it was an accident, but the repairs are gonna be expensive, I just know it. I didnât want to become another teenage driving statistic where reckless teenagers crash their cars for no reason, so I always tried my best to drive as safe as possible, but now I am. There are a lot of days where I wake up and and the first I do is ask why. I hate myself even more now, my life has no value. Iâm a terrible example for my younger cousin who is just learning to drive, and I honestly feel traumatized. Nonetheless, this is all my fault and Iâm not asking for any sympathy, I donât deserve any. But I feel so sick right now, worse than earlier and I canât go back to sleep. l donât want to feel this anymore, but Iâd just get found and I donât want to create another unnecessary bill. Thank you to everyone who bothered to read this, I appreciate it."
"I want to die, but I can't. (Rant)I don't want to be alive, I'm tired, I'm so so tired of everything.

I'm tired of being the ""strong friend"". The past two weeks I tried being more open, I tried telling my friends what was going on, but they've got their own problems, how can I ask them for help, when I'm supposed to be the one who helps them ?  
I'm sorry if this sounds selfish, but I'm tired of trying to convince my friend its worth it to stay alive, and that she's loved, but she doesn't believe it.

But then that makes me hate myself even more because I'm a fucking hypocrite trying to talk others out of suicide, when I'm on the verge myself.

Then I can't ask for help because my friends need me, no one wants to see depressed, suicidal me, they want the funny, happy, me. 

And I do get happy, I get happy, and things are okay and good, when I'm with my friends and boyfriend at school. But now because of corona there is no school, there's isolation.

And I can't stand it, when I'm alone I get worse, I don't want to be alone, I don't know if I can make it being at home all day, every day.

The past few days I've stayed locked in my room, only leaving when necessary. If I don't have to go to school, whats the point of leaving my room.

I can't stand being at my house though, mom always leaves, dad is always locked in his room when mom leaves, little brother is too young to understand.

Dad tried to overdose on sleeping pills last night when mom left, it didn't work. Imagine it did, and my brother would have found him while I was locked in my room, and my mom was God knows where.

Mom is leaving again tonight, what if he does it again ?  
I have to stay alive for my little brother.

I want to die, I want to end it all so badly, but I can't bear the thought of my little brother finding me.

I can't even express it with words at this point. I've wanted to die since I was 9, I've held on all these years, it's getting harder and harder and I don't know how much longer I can do this."

He's a great guy, quiet, but really means a lot to me as a friend, and I would feel destroyed if he took his own life. Back in September he was in the hospital for a 'heart problem' because of some medication, but told me today that this was an attempt at suicide, and I fear he's going to do it again because he's become more quiet and generally less enthusiastic about all of things he, my friends, and I usually do together. On one hand, he's my friend and told me this in confidence, so I feel bad betraying his trust. But I love him and can't see him do this, so I need to do something. I don't know what. We're both 16 if that means anything. Thanks for your time."

I lost it at that point and was yelling/crying âwhy!â, âI was so close!â, ânooooooo!â And getting really angry.
I had no remorse and was mad that I wasnât able to complete my mission

It the evening now and I still have no regrets over what I did. Believe it or not I was at piece with myself during that initial blackout and was probably the happiest Iâd been in a long timeâ

My neck is sore and I have a red ring around my neck. I have a headache and some bruising on my body as I think I might have hit something on my way down.

Iâm gonna try again tmr with a belt and see if that works"

"Margaret and her self-destructive behaviour Aight so let's say my name is Margaret and I'm responsible for having self destructive behaviours and it's getting to me because I'm in a important phase of my high school an beacause having desi parents  is an added... uh..thing.

I want to stop ruining my own life and I'm trying my best. I just hate the fact that I use sleep as my escape factor, let it be stress, work or anxiety. I literally slept thu my english orals and I hate the fact that not only did I make my mom pissed, I fuckin dissapointed my teacher too + probably lost my grade.

Our school has a counselor, but I don't think that's a good idea since she might gossip with other teachers. I dunno what to do, I'm tired and want to kill off that part of myself that is fricked up."
"i donât think iâve ever been genuinely happylooking back at it, i think the last time i was truly happy and carefree was when i was 10. since then iâve known nothing but insecurity, self-doubt, horrible depression, crippling anxiety, trauma, eating disorders, bpd and so much more. even if iâm having a good day, itâs not necessarily that everything is great itâs just that those i mentioned above arenât as heavy as most days. is this normal? does being mentally ill mean iâm gonna feel this way forever and never be truly happy? iâd rather just end my life.

"Lost all hopeI never thought Iâd be making a throwaway and post something like this but here I am. 

I have always dealt with depression for years and self harm. Itâs decreased a bit, but some events have triggered it and Iâm just at the end of my rope. If it wasnât for my job Iâd be dead right now. Thatâs the only thing weirdly is thatâs keeping me from attempting is having work at 8 am. I used to be happy, have a great support system, be the strong one out of the people around me. Now I have no one. My parents donât give a fuck, my friends ignore me unless I have something to offer. My life consists of me getting high off Xanax and drinking when Iâm not working or attempting to get my degree. Iâm only in my early 20s Iâm young but just seeing the suffering of those even older than me makes me realize this isnât worth it anymore. I also went thru a very nasty breakup and itâs been six weeks since it happened but the relationship was toxic in a lot of ways so Iâm very fucked up mentally because of it. Two months ago I was doing well in school, got a promotion and had fallen in love for the first time in almost 6 years. Now Iâm just a shell of who I am and I donât want to feel like this anymore. I just want a painless way to sleep forever. "

Have a plan to either hang myself in the basement or use a plastic bag with helium. Need help and guidance to make the dark thoughts disappear. Iâve become a recluse. Would rather live my life in a cabin in the woods. Alone. Possibly end my life there at some point. Thatâs all I have to say really. Need help. Please.

"A ReleaseSuicide has always been a thought on my mind. When I was a kid, I found things to cling to, so that I would never do it. A quote from a book, the cuteness of a puppy, the taste of my favorite food, the fear of the afterlife. It kept me going for 23 years. I felt safe from myself. 

This year has torn me apart. I have always been optimistic. There is a piece of my childlike innocence and joy that has stayed intact, through all the hardships life has thrown at me. I felt like I could endure anything. That I could defy the world and keep a part of me pure. My hope and endless love to give has kept me going. But it's not intact anymore. I feel pieces of who I am dying, being taken from me. At first, I thought it was just me finally growing up, like the world has to take that part away from me for me to be an adult and truly live. 

It feels more sinister and dark now. I gave myself a year to follow my heart, to take risks, damn the consequences. No risk, no reward, right? I did everything I should have. I did everything I needed to. I just wanted a light at the end of the tunnel. I wanted just a glimmer of hope. It seems silly to put so much into New Year's. It's just another day, right? But I used to care so much. I used to feel uncontainable joy and excitement. No matter what I was going through, I could always just focus on the little things in my future that would bring me joy. They would keep me going. Now I'm realizing, I can't do that anymore.  

It brings me to the question, is life worth living if who you are dies? There are small, but unique parts that make me who I am. They have been sacred to me. For the first time, I'm losing them. I can't hold on anymore. As much as I have struggled and hurt over this year, I have held back from this. I haven't posted here. I haven't planned anything out. Never wrote a note. Didn't check myself into a psych ward. Didn't call the hotline. Nothing. 

That has officially changed. I just finished writing a goodbye. It felt good. I don't know what tomorrow brings or if I will see another year. For the first time, I really don't know. That scares me more than anything. 

I think I just wanted to say that. I can't say this to anyone I know. My family and friends don't know this part of me. My partner is the only one who knows and he's grown tired of hearing it. 

I hope I don't wake up. Every night, I just hope that I never have to wake up again."
"I need help.I've had depression for years now. It's gotten progressively worse, and I'm afraid I've finally reached my breaking point. My fiance left me, and I can't blame her. But now I have nobody, and no plans. 

I call the hotlines, and they ask me what I want to accomplish, and what I want from life. And my answer is the same. Nothing. Nothing sounds appealing. If I won a billion dollars, I'd still feel stale, empty.

I don't have insurance, so I can't get medicine or help. I feel like I've run out of excuses to put the gun down. I can't wake up to another day. I just can't. I reach out to people, but nobody notices, or tries to help. Everyone is moving at a pace I can't keep up with. 

I'm stuck in a cold dead town in Indiana. The only jobs are in menial dead end factories. I have no neighbors, and there are few activities besides drinking. My home, if you can call it that, is falling apart around me. I'm just so alone and useless.

What do I do? Where do I start? Or is it finally time to go to sleep one last time?"

"I really don't knowI just got waitlisted for a job that i've wanted for 5 years. I wrote 30 paragraphs for my application, and i poured my soul into it because the place this job is is the only place that has ever felt like a home to me. I feel like i'm never going to find someone who loves me. Every time i've dated someone i never really felt loved, and i know the person i like right now will never love me back. All of my friends are getting into colleges and doing the things in their lives that they want to do, and i just feel replaceable. I know that i'm the disposable friend that's left out of trips and activities because there wasn't enough space for me to go. I know that i'm not going to be able to do the things i want to in life. I want to be a doctor or a musician, but i cant focus enough to remember anything for chem tests. I've been faking that i know what I'm doing for so long that i don't know how to be real about anything anymore. i don't feel like i'm worth anything, and i've been dragging people down with me because of it. the only reason i've dated some people before wasn't because i loved them, but because i just wanted to feel like someone actually cared about me. Plus i have a problem with imagining my future before i know if something will happen or not, and when the match that started the flame of my future never lights, my life just topples. I've been trying to distract myself with the things i like, a few TV shows i watch just came out with new seasons, but now they're over. I wish i could restart my life somewhere new, but i can't. My art wont improve, no matter how hard i practice. I can't memorize anything i need to for school, no matter how hard i study. my music just doesn't fit, no matter how many melodies or tempos or beats i've tried. I was told to fake it till i make it, but i feel like ill never make it, and faking it is all i've been doing.

The only reason I havenât done it yet is because of my mom and my grandma. They say they need me in their lives. I feel like Iâm not going to make it past 18. Everyday I think about how there is no need for me in the world and it would be better off without me. Am I just a coward? I keep on telling myself Iâm going to kill myself yet Iâm afraid to go through with it. Mostly because I donât want my body to be found. I want to like just disappear off the face of earth."

"You Should be Hopeful Compared to MeLife is not a competition, yet I have failed in every way imaginable and compared to me you are a winner. Hitting rock bottom is different for everyone but my rock bottom is truly terrible and it reflects my bad life choices.

I have had no self respect for myself in almost 40 years of living. I have been intimate with over 50 men and most of those occasions I was drunk and desperate for attention. I have ruined my relationships and have had multiple miscarriages, I've never been married and now I know I can't be in a relationship of any kind as I will only damage the other person. I have been an addict and had an awful drinking problem for years and years however I was still a mess before this as well. 

I have no degree and I have talked my way into being hired in multiple jobs and I have built a career I hate and I have burned my bridges so that I can't have references to get another job during this difficult time, and I wouldn't be hired anyways as all the jobs I've wrongly had require a degree now. I resigned my job before Covid and I don't even qualify for unemployment.  I lost my fiance, my cat, and my home from these actions. 

 I am in severe debt, I almost died and had to go in for emergency surgery with no insurance a few months ago. Prior to that I have had to move home to my parents (who I have also neglected over the years) as I was asked to leave my home by my now ex-fiance after losing my job and not being able to take care of myself or afford rent/bills. In addition to being hospitalized I had other severe health problems a few months prior to that and I am still suffering from feeling dizzy, have issues with focus, and I do not feel well enough to move forward or help myself get better in any of the ways I used to be able to. 

Now I see my life has been wasted, there are no more options for someone like me. I was a drunk and a drug abuser for years and years, I am now sober for the past two months and I remember all of the bad things I've done and cannot forgive myself for. I don't deserve to be here still. I don't deserve to have a place to stay, I should be on the street. I spend most of my days researching how to end things, I need to find a method that works and will not fail. 

If you are still reading this long sad rant of my life, karma is real and I am in this place in my life because of my mistakes and my bad behavior and compared to me, hopefully you see that your life still has hope and has options for success. Mine does not, I spend my days researching options to end my life and I have no joy, the only thing I look forward to is sleeping and to not wake up at some point. I have nothing to build on, nothing to feel happy about, and no options to fix the mess I have made.

To recap I have multiple health/mental problems and no way to pay to help myself through them, I have lost everything, I have no job or hopes of getting another one, I am worse than broke, I have no future and I have been lucky to have even made it to this point with my crazy behavior, and being sober and seeing my past clearly I know I have hurt a lot of people and I do not deserve to move forward. I only want out of this life, there is no way to fix things. I need to end this life soon, I have been suffering for a very long time and I have only caused suffering in other people."

"My mom told me to ""just die""Im struggling this morning, couldnt look in the mirror

I'm 17, having trouble attending school

Spoke with my mom about what I should do (go vs stay home) and she was frustrated with me in what felt like seconds. We avoid all talk of depression or mental health with her because it irritates her, so in times like these we get nowhere.

But I also don't have anyone else.

I told her that I just wanted to disappear and she snapped and said, ""okay then, just die!"" I don't think she meant it but it felt like being stabbed. It's been 15 minutes and she left the house, took my car, I'm alone with my dad (not safe). I texted my friends and no one can pick me up. This doubt is creeping up on me and I want to go get the cyclobenzaprine and xanax in my medicine cabinet and chase it with vodka, or the knife sitting five feet away and slice open my thighs. I want to. I want to. If I kick out the screen I can get through the window, but there's nowhere for me to go. I need to disappear."
"Going to school is becoming difficult because of my past relationship with my ex. Is this normal? So, we split, and it was less than clean. Long story short, they wanted to transition to female, but I'm straight. 

They kept me in a relationship for six months by threatening suicide. I got into a pretty dark place. I set them up with a counsellor for their depression and I tried to move on. It has been difficult. I can't see them without being reminded of every time they insulted me about my sexuality and said things like ""It's incredible. All of this because you're straight. If you want, I can just stay male. Just know I'll be dead within the year. Remember that my will to live is based entirely on this relationship."" I can't be around them without feeling the same doubt, fear and hate for myself. I'm still very shaken and insecure about some things that happened during the relationship. 

They're in my art class, and since we are using the quarter system, that takes up half my day. 
My ex has begun to turn my friends against me for breaking up with a trans person. I understand their point of view. I already feel like a dirtbag. I feel like my school life is taking a downward turn, and I know it's just school, but school used to be my escape from home. Now it's just alternation between these two things I hate. 

Have you ever been in a similar situation with an ex? If so, how do you handle this sort of thing? I'm sorry for going on this long."

"ive never felt like ive belonged and it's pushing me off the edgei'm a chinese adoptee. grew up in a white family. didn't fit in with them. went to public school for high school. finally get to be around asian people. didn't fit in with them, too whitewashed, too awkward and immature. i go to college. start dating a guy first semester. i feel like i belong for the first time. bad idea. he cheats on me with a 13 year old girl. we don't date anymore and i have a restraining order. i make several suicide attempts for months and quit school for a semester. i move forward as best as i can. still no friends i feel like i can rely on. he starts dating his coworker (i knew it would happen before we broke up). i don't have problems with her. i'm not jealous of the relationship. i'm jealous of the support. people know what he did to me. but because i'm crazy since i'm suicidal and have bipolar disorder i don't think anyone wants to hear it. even if i hide the really bad stuff. even as a pedophile he finds belonging. but me? no one noticed i was gone. i wonder if they'll notice if i really leave one day. why am i so unworthy of belonging? i try to be normal and i never make any offensive jokes, and i don't speak too much and i'm not shy. i leave space and i act myself. but. its. not. enough."
"It's timeI have attempted suicide more times than I can count. I've woken up in ICU so many times.

I feel like this is really it right now though. I know how to do it now I think.

Even when there are people around me, I am so lonely. The pain is just too much.

I'm going to do it on Friday. I am not worth saving and I would rather donate my organs to those who are.

I did try. I really did. The first time I attempted suicide I was 15. I'm now 29. It's time to say goodbye.

I asked my mom not so long ago about how she would feel if I passed away (I didn't hint at suicide). Her main concern was that she wouldn't want to pay for a funeral. They can chuck me in a random hole for all I care. 

Nobody will speak to me and nobody cares. It's OK because maybe I can make a lot of other people's lives better?

"Bliss used to be niceLet me just start off as I thought I had everything, but it seemed to just be a lie.

I had friends, but they are no where. I try my best to initiate and talk, not just that; I try and I plan things to do. I get ignored. Everyone ignores me, things seem pointless of course. I did try making other friends, but of course... I didn't have hope, along with family, with they always fight. 

I am told I was a disappointment many times, from people I care about to family. I know it's just me, who can I blame. I am ghost, if I was hated that means someone cares to take that time out their day. 

Life was getting me down, I didn't have anything. Until I met someone, but it seemed to be a lie. Even in the end, I really meant little to nothing. Even when I clung on to the happiness I had. I try to do what I can, to be the best as they would like.

The only real thing I have is cancer, I don't want it to take me. I rather do it myself. I try to fight, I try to do my best, to not give up... but look all that hurt. Things are pointless and I can't trust anyone. 

Used to laugh and joke all the time, with a smile on my face, with positivity. Taking the day without any problems and I could handle anything. You can guess how I changed.

Thank you"

"I have absolutely no friends and it makes me wanna dieItâs my own damn fault. 

My Depression made me isolate myself and push people away. 

I think part of the reason why I pushed so many people away is so there would be less people sad over my death when I eventually kill myself. Witch could be any day now, Iâm just waiting for when I finally breakdown and canât handle it anymore"
"I'm tired. 17 year old girl, senior in high school. 

I am so sick of it all. All I do is think and analyze everything...it's as if there are two parts of me and one is always telling me I am not good enough: not thin or pretty or smart enough...and the other part of me is telling me that it's okay, that it's unrealistic to expect so many things from myself. I really can't take it anymore. 

I used to have an eating disorder (not specifically diagnosed, my parents never sent me to a doctor because that would cost money), but I failed at that too. Now it's just too difficult to starve myself to the extent that I did before and still keep my grades up. I hardly ever speak to my parents because, well, I can't even begin to explain the mindfuckery behind it all. I'll be honest and admit that I don't make it easy on my mother (not applicable to my dad, because he doesn't give a fuck about me), and can be quite nasty. I don't know why I do these things. 

I'm fairly certain at times my parents just want to be rid of me. 
My mother only ever talks to me by email now...and she is now forcing me to get birth control pills because she believes I have PMDD...it's embarrassing and insulting to me. What if she's wrong? Can't I just be depressed? Getting on birth control won't make my problems disappear. I'll still hate school and believe I'm not good enough. I'll still think I'm ugly and wish I could be a skeleton...I'll still cut myself. And my problems with my mother won't go away because of some magic pill. There is no quick fix. Well...I mean, not one that leaves me alive. 

I desperately want someone important in my life, but I push away any guy that comes near me. I can't let them find out how messed up I am...I know I'll screw up somehow. I also feel too repulsive to allow anyone close. In a way it disgusts me that guys find me sexually attractive...so much so that I feel sick to my stomach. It's strange because I also have little respect for my body. I don't even know. I just can't accept affection, though I do want it. 

I have no future. I don't want to live the rest of my life like this. I also have no interest in college. I get scholarship notifications and applied to a prestigious school after being sent a special application, but my mother doesn't believe I will get a large enough scholarship to be able to afford going. She discouraged me from pursuing art (the only thing I'm remotely interested in) and really just wants me to go to community college. With my nearly perfect GPA and high ACT score, I can do better. If I go to community college, I'll definitely kill myself. I can't believe I'm still alive to begin with. I had the lethal dosage of pills ready this summer...

What am I supposed to do?

"I'm close to edge Alot of things have been going on in my life and it's like everytime I start to bounce back from my suffering something comes along and fucking kicks me right in the balls, like seriously why do I exist if I'm just here to suffer no matter what I do, I know its pretty cause there is people out there starving and homeless and who have lost loved ones but seriously why is everything in my life completely and utterly fucked, I  have approached my parents about my constant anxiety and depression and u wanna know what they fucking say ""Everyone feels like that at ur age, it'll pass"", it wont fucking pass cause I've been like this for six fucking years, fuck sake, things were starting to get good as well, I asked out a girl she said yes, then 2 weeks later she breaks up with me then I approach another girl who I absolutely love to fucking pieces and she airs me, literally didnt even say anything just ignored the fact that I said that I love her, honestly I'm fucking finished with life now, the only thing from stopping me from grabbing a rope and ending it is my fear of death and thank fuck I have that."
"Life is hardDo you ever just look in a mirror and feel disappointed with what you see? Thatâs me every time I stare at my reflection. I have a car, my own studio apartment, a job that pays well, a family that cares for me, friends who care for me, but yet I feel that I have nothing. Deep inside, thereâs an immense amount of worthlessness. Thereâs this emptiness so deep that thereâs nothing that could ever fill it. Itâs an abyss, a void, a vacuum that sucks all energy except those that are negative. My emptiness knows my weaknesses and it enjoys preying on it.

Life is hard when youâre depressed"

"Going to end it soonI hate for it to be the reality, but the time has come. I developed a severe disability that has continued to destroy my life and livilihood for the past 10 years. I can't get a job due to it and the daily pain is constant

Unfortunately I made the collosull mistake of getting married and having kids. I love them all, but my disability puts me in a perpetual bad mood and I snap and yell frequently at them. They don't deserve that. And it prevents me from providing for my family at all

Fortunately I had the foresight to purchase a substantial life insurance policy in the past, so when I go at least my family will be taken care if

Its grossly unfair that the world has changed in a way to trigger my disbility, and no one cares. No one can help. Its just nevetending pain and dissapointment. Whatever I did to deserve this, I am truly sorry. Perhaps I did nothing and thus is just a testament to the lack of caring that people have for others when they change the laws to ones that trigger pain for people like me. Who knows

I have no idea why i am posting this, i guess I felt like saying goodbye to someone. Goodbye"
"My Mental Illnesses and Fetish made me give up.I am about to turn 19 years old and I don't see a future for myself. I believe my psychological issues are endless or that my anxiety is so bad that I've tricked myself into believing anything remotely bad is what I have. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and was prescribed anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds when I was 16. However, these did nothing for me after taking them for three months so I stopped. I'm a gay male who went through an abusive relationship with my ex, my mother left the family, I was left to raise my 3 younger siblings, I see my father maybe 3 times a year, The stress to maintain a 4.0 GPA in college is taking a toll on me, I'm watching porn that terrifys me. I feel i'm incapable of loving...I don't see myself being able to truly ever be loved or to love someone else. I crave it but yet it doesn't turn me on anymore. I have to reach to extreme porn to even masturbate and it is the only thing that will turn me on anymore and I hate myself so much for it.  I want so badly to just be normal...to have a relationship with a guy. I want to crave plain vanilla sex, even though I've never been able to actually enjoy or get off during sex i've struggled every-time. The only porn that is getting me off these days sadly is \*sighs\* beastiality. The weird thing is growing up I told myself I HATED dogs. To be honest I still do? I don't understand why this is turning me on. I was hoping it's a phase but it's turning into a habit that makes me feel so guilty that I just wanna end it. I don't feel I could be fixed. There is no way in hell I would ever talk to a therapist about something so disgusting. I either will get over this on my own or I'll die. I want so badly to be loved. I am also a psychopathic liar who lives in a fantasy world. I've created this fake image to myself that i've made myself believe that i'm gonna be the richest person ever who has a capitalistic empire and I don't care who i'll have too step on to get too it. When someone call's me evil and a bad person I smile. I want to get better I really do and I don't want these thoughts of beastiality controlling me anymore. I see dogs in public now and i'm so scared my brain says ""I bet that person has sex with their dog"" even though I know nobody thinks like this. A year ago I would've NEVER had thoughts like this. I was only addicted to porn that was a little brutal but it was only humans. I can't live my life like this anymore, it's become too much for me. I try so hard to sext guys who have interest in me and it's something I can think I'd like to fantasize about but it just doesn't turn me on anymore. I have to resort to the nasty porn I hate so much.  I need guidance or else it's gonna be too late for me I suppose."
Reapect to my teacher I started online school today and one of my teachers had us all change our Zoom names to have our pronoun at the end. Ex: (he/him) (she/her) etc. I just thought this was really cool and wanted to share.
"Friday nightToday, I got a huge bonus for doing good work over the past few months. I went out at night to Fry's and picked myself up a Wii U. I set it up at around 11pm (still living with parents btw, and I'm 29 years old) and launched Super Mario 3D World. The screen asked that three other players should join in.

At that point I realized my situation, no friends, no girlfriend (never had one), still playing video games while living in my parents house on a friday night (while my parents are asleep). It clicked and I was ready to kill myself at that point.

I'm still having anxiety over this thought. I turned off my wii and here I am before I try to get some sleep."
"I *kind of* quit gaming :( Yes, you read it right, I quit. 

Reasons:

1. My PC crashes a lot. Specs are 4GB RAM and NVidia GeForce GTX 710A. As of now, my PC lags bad af and now it's completely crashed. I know you would say that buy/build/upgrade your PC, but I cannot spend a huge amount of money on my PC. My dad is running out of temper looking at my activity on the PC. 
2. I am bored. I just wanna quit. I want to get productive and not waste (sorry to use this, gamers) my time in gaming. I want to grow more and in **my** life, gaming is kinda avoiding me to do that.

I have Rocket League, Valorant, CS:GO, Minecraft and other games. I am deleting everything &gt;!except minecraft!&lt; and just refreshing my mind. I don't mean, and I never will, that games are useless and  harmful. Play games, my people. But I can't move on. 

&gt;!I'll earn money and buy a nice PS/Xbox.!&lt; 

I'm just expressing myself and not encouraging quitting of games. All I wanna say is life your fucking life."
"I don't know what to write in the title, so I will use keywords: school life; studies; depression; adulthoodWhen I was in high school, a physics teacher told me once, in front of the whole class, that people like me, who only studied, would end up going crazy. I finished high school 10 years ago and I never forgot that, but not because I agreed. I didn't forget that because I thought it was ridiculous for him to say that. I was raised in a system that told me that the more I studied and devoted myself to studies, the more certain things would be for me. Well, after a few years in adulthood I clearly realize that I was wrong. And today I started to think that maybe my teacher was right. I'm really going crazy. I am isolating myself, I am practically without friends (I only have two), I have no desire to study or work and my affective relationship is falling apart. I feel like depression is taking over me and there are days (like today) that I don't know what else to do. It gives me a sincere and deep desire to disappear. it is not necessarily a desire to die, but a desire to disappear.

Does anyone relate to this? Does anyone else feel like a victim of this ridiculous school system that doesn't really prepare us for life?"

Please help?Can someone please tell me why I should live? I regret so much. I have things I'll never be able to take back or do over and not get so badly hurt. I'll never go back to being ignorant that people really didn't believe me. Was I really just being a drama queen like some of them thought? I know I put myself in a stupid situation and I know I said and did all the wrong things but I still thought someone would help if I told them I was hurt. It was so long ago but the humiliation comes back in waves again and again and again.
"Pretended to be someone else on the internet since 2016 and just got caught by my online bestfriend that iâve know for 6years and now i want to dieJust to be clear i have never used photos of another person. I pretended to be someone other than myself (I changed my name, age and location) because since 9th grade i struggle to make friends. I spent all of my high school years alone i did not make a single friend i was not bullied or anything but everybody at school ignored me because i guess i'm not very approachable (and i'm afraid to talk to people my age because i always feel like they are very judgmental and compared to them i'm a piece of shit).
I have already been to several doctors but they were never able to help me because even to doctors I could not admit that I was pretending to be someone else on the internet. The people I've met and lied to feel like real friends to me, i've know them for several years but I lied to their face and think iâm another person than who i really am. I could never confess to them about what i did and i have tried several times to ghost them and stop all this bullshit as i know it is horrible but i never had the guts to do it as they are the only friends i have and my only emotional support. In some situations i think if they weren't there to make me feel like a worthy person i would have tried to kill myself. I donât have any friends irl. I just entered college and failed to fit in the first few days and I feel more lonely than ever.
The only ""real"" friend i have (who knows me under my real identity) discovered my secret yesterday. At first i tried to lie and deny everything, but he confessed to me that he had suspicions for a while. He collected tons of evidence and sent it to me, so much that i canât lie anymore. Iâm so ashamed that i would have blocked and ghosted him if i could. 
Unfortunately I am deeply attached to him. I sometimes even wondered if I was not developing romantic feelings towards him. Before he found out my secret he was the person i was the most comfortable with in the world. He doesn't know it but I think having had at least one person who speaks to me like the real me and makes me feel like a person who deserves to live kept me from turning 100% crazy and only be in contact with people to whom I lie and who think I am someone else. I guess i just lost my only friend. I can't stand the shame of confessing to him after additionally trying to lie to him.
I am a terrible person and i just wish i had the courage to kill myself but iâm not gonna do it because iâm a coward who canât stand the pain. I have never been so sad in my life. I am so ashamed that I constantly want to throw up and I struggle to eat. Iâm sorry for my english and the way i type, it is not my first language. I donât know why I posted this, I guess I needed to write all i feel somewhere since i have no one to talk to.
Please don't insult me, I already know what I did was wrong and I regret it terribly, I haven't stopped crying and having dark thoughts since last night"

"I ordered something for myself on Amazon and I need help. So today I ordered something on Amazon for myself, and I asked my mom not to open it, for I will be at my friends house when it arrives, and she insisted on opening it to find out what it is.

"the look on my best friend's face so it was new year's eve and I was hanging out with my best friend and his girlfriend and another female friend of mine and it was 10 mins until Jan 1st before the fireworks in our area set off, so I was just sitting there and waiting and reflecting over what happened throughout the year and I look at him and his girlfriend was talking to that other friend of mine and the look on his face was just so wholesome and genuine like he wanted to kiss his girlfriend so bad but he couldn't cuz we were in public and pda isn't allowed where we live in but like, that look on his face was just so wholesome and it lives rent free in my head, it's like he appreciates her existence so much and all the troubles in his life are just gone when he's with her and he's just so grateful, it's really interesting seeing how much we can deduce from plain emotions and looks and yea that's it that kinda made me really happy knowing my best friend has a source of happiness and im glad they're together"

"Just feel like God's punching bagI never thought it would've come to this. Two years ago I had a well paying job, my own house, I had hobbies. I danced. I read. I went out. I met the sweetest, nerdiest girl on the planet. I had my best friend move in with me. Everything was tits. Then I got laid off. 

""Okay"" I thought, ""No problem, this happens. No biggie, I'll get another job in no time."" 

A couple weeks go by, and I get antsy. There are no jobs out there. No one's hiring. No one's calling. My friend's girlfriend moved in with me. Since she had a job, I let her move in. Anything to help pay the bills, y'know? A couple weeks go by, and my friend is acting weird. Like, taking her car and disappearing for 6 hours at a time weird. I chalk it up to meds he's been taking, as he got some teeth taken out. It's not cool, but it's not my place. 

So one night when he disappears, she and I start talking. We talk for about a half hour, when she asks:

""Oh, that's right. Did Lance give you the rent money yesterday.""

Um... No. 

Turns out he was spending time with his ex-wife (who kicked him out in the first place and started dating someone else) and spent close to $300 in fake weed. That struck me like a bullet. I gave him a month to get a place and leave. 

The entire time, I felt like the biggest hypocrite. I smoked the real stuff with him and my girlfriend. It helped me put the worry of juggling bills aside and focus on learning game development. But you can't sacrifice your best friend and your girlfriend for your ex-wife. Not one who kicked you out. Not one who strips at a shitty dive bar and blows patrons behind the place for an extra $50.

My girlfriend at this point knows I'm on the edge. I can't focus on hobbies. I'm missing dance classes. So she offers to smoke with me some more. 

So I smoke. Never smoked, never found the need for it, but it got me focused. I decided to out all my energy towards learning to develop video game assets and programming. 

""Okay!"" I thought, ""No problem. Let's do some personal work!"" 

My computer had other plans. The motherboard fried on it. I have no budget for another computer. I take a few breaths, then upload some computer science books onto my phone. Have to do something. 

So I smoke a small bit and get into writing. That works for a moment. I talk to another very close friend of mine. He's relocating out of state to his dad's house. His dad owns a multimillion dollar company, so he'll clear something with his dad. I'll have a job in sunny California. My girlfriend could go to college. I could negotiate a payment plan and pay back what I owe. I could even take my brother out of the shit he's in and put his life back on track. 

Then I get a notice for a drug test. I start to panic, swear off weed entirely, and begin drinking tons of water. I talk to my friend from earlier, he advises me to just keep drinking tons of water. ""But if you fail, just more reason to come with us."" 

I polish off a case of water and a detox bottle (on the advice of my mother). But I have a nagging feeling in the back of my head. So I message my friend's father on Facebook, introducing myself and asking if he needs any hands on deck. I go in and take my drug analysis. 

""Nothing in the foreseeable future. Sorry. ""

My heart sank so low people in China are wondering what to do with it. And now I'm here, the only good thing left going for me cuddled up next to me. I can't give her the life I wanted, the family I wanted. I'm sitting in a house, terrified the electric is going to go out, and I'll have no means to keep her warm. 

I don't know what to do. I only wanted to do good, to help everyone out. But it seems like no matter what I do, someone or something's stabbing my back. 

I broke down completely last night. Put a pair of scissors to my throat. The only reason I didn't jam it into my carotid was because I didn't want my girlfriend to find me. But I can't keep up with the bills on just unemployment. If that test comes back positive, I'm done. I can't do it anymore. I can't take anymore. I haven't slept in two days, and haven't eaten for three. 

Thank you, for reading. I just wanted to get this off my chest."
"Sometimes I feel like killing myself because I miss my dad so muchMy dad died 6 and a half years ago. He died in a VERY traumatic and unexpected way, on Thanksgiving. 

My dad and I had the most special bond. Words don't do it jurstice.

Is it still supposed to hurt this bad? 

Soon it will be 7 years and I still wake up screaming for him every night, because all I have are nightmares, and all I want is him.

I have a recurring dream that he wasn't actually all the way dead when he was buried. This is not grounded in any sort of reality, after what happened, he was clearly dead. 

What's the point of life when you realize that your whole universe could be shattered so, so easily. How do you go on when you've seen the person you love more than anything in a state that you only thought existed in horror rmovies?

I feel so wronged. WHy did they take him from me? Why did life have to influct his death on me and him in such a devestatingly cruel way? If some god or universal force needed to take him from me, why couldn't they have taken him peacefully. Why on Thanksgiving?

How is that fair?"
Desperately want to die.Iâve been suicidal for several years now but itâs really intensified this year since losing my job in January. I also have some physical health problems which are really making it hard for me to be optimistic about life.
"Hey, do you wanna talk? Do you wanna talk about something? Anything really. Vent to me. Ask for advice, just talk about how you're doing. I'm here for you. Dm me if you want."
"I don't want toOkay, so here's the deal up front. I don't want to die, I don't want to kill myself.

But I can't stop thinking about it.

Little stumbling blocks crop up and I find myself contemplating it, it would be so easy, just opt out of the whole struggle. I hate it, the thoughts depress me and I spend hours hating myself for thinking about it, the hate spirals into anger at the world for making me think that way (logical I know) and I wind up putting it out of mind, at least for a day or so.

But it creeps back, lurking in the back of my head. It honestly is scaring the hell out of me and I don't know what to do, I'm not sure if this is a cry for help or just me finally letting this out of my head, either way thanks for reading if you got this far through a scared messed up guy's confession."

"After the worst year of my life, Iâm just about over the edgeMy life has been chaos from the moment I was born and every time I think I hit rock bottom, things just keep getting worse.

My estranged birth mother killed herself
on my birthday this year and I have an overwhelming sense of guilt for never reconnecting with her in my whole adult life. I always thought about it but i never felt ready. I never thought sheâd just be gone. I was her only family and going through her apartment was brutal. I hadnât seen her since I was three and I was always very cold when she tried to converse with me online or otherwise, but she never forgot me. I wish I got her side of the story. 

But besides that, this year has been the worst of my life. It seems like storm after storm keeps coming at me and the more life I live, the more shame and guilt I feel about all of my actions as an adult woman. 

Iâve been reckless with my sexual habits, resulting in having HPV with my previous partner that evolved into pre-cancerous cells in my cervix, I had to have the LEEP procedure to have those cells removed with no guarantee they wonât grow back and being exposed to the herpes virus. I havenât had any symptoms but I know itâs in my body. 

I did a lot of drugs, that has resulted in deep shame and regret. I also have permanent anxiety now due to the amount of stimulants and alcohol Iâve dumped into my body. I got a DUI / hit and run on my bachelorette party âeveningâ which has been expensive and a pain in the ass. I canât even make eye contact with old friends of mine anymore because I feel so ashamed of my past. 

Iâm bisexual and have completely deprived myself of ever experiencing a romantic relationship with a woman (besides purely physical) before settling down and getting married and part of me has a deep dread about that. Iâve always preferred men in romantic situations but Iâm disappointed I never gave it a whole-hearted shot. Especially since I tend to lean toward damaged men. I love my husband to death but itâs still a regret of mine, one place where I wish I had been selfish. 

Iâve abandoned or screwed over anyone thatâs ever been important to me in some way or another due to my own abandonment issues I have from my childhood. I have OCD which heavily revolves around being abandoned. My compulsions drive me insane to the point where I sit in the fetal position and just tell myself how much I hate myself because of it. They arenât even that bad of compulsions but I get so sensitive to myself. 

Besides the mental issues, I was 2 months premature and was born with my intestines on the outside of my body due to my momâs drug and alcohol use while she was pregnant and I have many physical health complications that come with it. Iâm nauseas all day every day likely due to scar tissue in my stomach. I have insane migraines where Iâd rather die than endure them for 10 minutes. And more. Itâs hard to live a normal life with the mental and physical stuff thatâs happening to me 24/7. 

Iâve been to therapy. Counseling. Whatever. It never really helps much. I get in the office and Iâm this happy cheery optimistic freak who loves her life and then sobs hysterically the whole ride home. Whatâs wrong with me? I talk to friends about it and most of them donât like talking about it much, especially in detail. They get it and can relate but still makes them uncomfortable to talk about. I have my husband to talk to about anything, heâs a great person to bounce this shit off of but then I feel more guilty and more like a burden. Iâve fucked his life up enough as it is. 

I have made so many plans to kill myself. I always imagine a car accident. Or a gun. Iâm glad I donât own a gun. And lost my license because of the DUI. Iâve called and texted the emergency hotlines. Nothing really makes me feel better, though. I try to reach out. I try to talk about it. But nothing does the trick. I day dream about the long, dark silence that is death. Why should I be alive? Why did my mom not abort me like she should have? I wish she had. Life is cruel. If I didnât have my pets and husband, Iâd pack a bag and see how long I could survive in the woods with a tent and backpack. 

Thanks for letting me vent. I could write a whole fucking novel about all the fucked up stuff that had happened to me but I chose to limit it to this yearâs struggles alone. Maybe I should write a novel. Maybe someone will make it a movie and I can get rich before building the nerve to kill myself. "

"Every time I drive I just want to jerk the wheelItâd be so easy, and then everything would be over. I could do it in the night so that I wouldnât harm anyone else in the process.

Iâve been off them for two weeks and I thought I was lucky enough not to experience any side effects...unfortunately they were just postponed until I had hope I could go without it. I donât want to rely on a pill in order to function as a normal human being. Iâm done trying."

My brother repeatedly dismissed me as my niece was calling for me (shes 14) and was literally just trying for my attention all night.
I was just trying to have an adult conversation with my siblings. He kept being like bye...bye anon is calling for you....bye

"Iâm not thinking about suicide in an impulsive way now. Its seems like the only logical option now.The last two months at uni have been living hell. Iâve grown to despise this place more and more every fucking day. Thereâs not a single moment here that I donât think about home or just being somewhere else. Although this place has given me a great start in my field, I think that this wonât be of any use if Iâm not alive anymore. I havenât slept well for the past 2 months whenever I was at uni, the moment I got home I would sleep like a baby.

Iâve tried to make my parents understand this problem and that I want to drop out, but they just donât understand and tell me weather the storm. I think thatâs only possible if I can sleep at night. Iâm desperate. I donât know what I will do if I drop out as the only option left would be to study abroad, and for that dad would have to sell some real estate. I really donât know what to do. Jumping off the fourt floor seems like the option convenient for everyone."

What's your opinion on my body my choice? Say someone is in a destructive habit or are harming their body what would you do?
Iâm very tired goodnight
"I'm letting it all outI'm not expecting any sympathy or given any attention,  I'm really just using to really vent. 

The choice to want to end my life is completely my own. No one has influenced me or drove me to not want to continue living. My first suicide thought happened back in 2013 and at the time I brushed it off but after the next couple of years of poor grades, feeling I had no future, a failure and disappointment to myself and more importantly my family I made my first attempt to take my life in 2015. I waited for my parents to leave the house to which I went and grabbed my mothers Taurus Judge which was loaded and unsecured just in my mother's night stand. Held the firearm to my head and slowly put pressure on the trigger. The only thing that stopped me was the thought of what my parents would see when they did come home.  I was too afraid to seek personal help so I turned to online forums to see if I can help myself.  The repeating answer I found was ""Take it one day at a time"" 

Fast forward a couple of years I did scrape by and graduate high-school and enlisted in the military as an infantryman.  I am nervous about saying this but I turned down some bonus offers for different MOS because I fully expected to be deployed to a combat zone and get KIA. It wouldn't technically be suicide but me doing my job (I know I'm a piece of shit for even thinking that but its true and I wanted to get it off my chest) 

Well the combat deployment I had hoped for never came,  and beginning of 2020 was one of my darkest times. I grew tired of ""taking it one day at a time"" and sat down and made what was a fool proof plan to take my life. I bought my first AR-15 (was only 20 at the time so no pistol) and spent the next few weeks revising my plan. I knew exactly what,where,how, and when to do everything.  The last week before the date I set I tried my best to act as normal as possible. Bought my coworkers lunch, always volunteered at work, did a lot of favors for people so they suspected nothing. I made a mistake of getting absolutely shit faced on whiskey the night before and telling my online friends (whom I'm close with) my plan and saying my goodbyes. 

I know this is long as fuck so I'll shorten it now. They found where I'm at and reported me in, definitely saving my life. I immediately got apprehended and taken to a mental facility which sucked, but I was more concerned with my coworkers knowing of my attempt. Went to another facility shortly after  and now have a therapist I see weekly. It helped a little but the thoughts are definitely still there daily. 

I really do feel like a piece of shit because I have loving parents and few friends,  a steady income job, a roof over my head, and 3 meals a day. I know some people would kill to have what I have, I flat out shouldn't feel this way but I still do. 


If you actually read every bit of it, congrats you know more about me than my closest friend. Like I said I am not really looking for attention.  Just to desperately get it off my chest."

My feelings of depression are slowly killing me and I feel that I am losing all that I love and am not sure I can watch as it disappears.  I am seeing a counselor and am on medication, but it just doesn't seem to help.  I can't seem to connect with friends since I can't seem do to more then what I have to, to get through the day"

"Genuinely feel like I canât get through this.My girlfriend and I have been together for over 6 years. We started dating my senior year and through undergrad.

She recently broke up with me and I have no idea how Iâm going to get through this. Iâve been on the verge of tears all day and I just had to rush into the bathroom of my building so people wouldnât see me cry. I already deal with abandonment issues and she was my support system cause itâs hard for me to open up to friends and family.

I genuinely donât think I can get through this. All I can think about is our relationship/memories or ways I can take my life without suffering too much. Iâm in grad school during the hardest part of the year and I canât focus during class or in my office. Nights are near impossible.

I just donât know what to do. Itâs overwhelming. The only thing keeping me from taking my life is imagining the effect itâd have on my immediate family and my close friends. But I just donât want to feel this anymore. 

I know itâs so cliche and seems dramatic but I just needed to say this somewhere."

"Today is my birthday......and I just don't care anymore. I'm 21 years old and have never seen a point in living. The only reason I still haven't killed myself is my family and girlfriend.

I'm jealous of every single person who is happy. I'm not saying that I've never was happy, but my happiness usually lasts for a couple of days few times a year. I've never felt any long-term happiness. My dad just yesterday called me a life disaster...

Whenever I start doing something, I never finish it... I don't know why I have such an insane lack of motivation ever since I was little. I'm always anxious about everything, my heart is always pounding and looks like it's going to pop out through my chest. I'm never calm, probably have never been. I have memory issues. What has happened to me that triggered all these things? Can I ever be happy? I think I could, but I really need serious help... I'm scared to talk to anyone at all about how I feel every day. A friend of mine said that I should try visiting a doctor and telling him this all, but I just can't.

I started ignoring a lot of my friends, close friends - only because... I actually don't know why exactly. I'm just fucked up in my head. Help... "

"having to face my reality again, and this time i feel like i'm actually gonna do iti've been here multiple times throughout the years, but this time i feel like i'm becoming a danger to myself. i just tried to start another degree, something that i thought would be more my thing, and that would challenge my mind. 

well, i'm having to come to terms with the fact that i'm an idiot yet again. failed every single one of my intro essays, whilst trying my best on every one. university was my backup plan, my safety net. turns out i'm not cut out for that either.   
my only strengths are in mental math, understanding music and writing hollow, pretentious paragraphs about stuff i think i have some knowledge on. Looking through my playlists on youtube i feel like such a pretentious twat i wanna delete everything and shoot myself in the head  
that's my whole life, i'm a fuckin idiot, failing everything, living with my parents while my friends are getting their master's degree. i can't even figure out what to do in order to at least not look like a complete idiot every day.

"Advice?I've been feeling depressed for a while now (4~ years) with the suicidal thoughts coming on hard for the past 6 months or so, but I feel guilty for being like this. I've got a lot of things going for me (one of the top universities in the world, loving family, good work experience) but I just can't seem to keep myself in there.

For a long time I've been telling myself that ""it'll be better at University"" but it isn't, it's worse. Now, I feel even worse about having such social anxiety that I can't leave my staircase without 6~ units of alcohol. I'm incredibly boring, have a face only a mother could love and pretty much a loner.

I actually feel disgusted posting this, it's such a teenage angst bawww especially compared to people who real problems, and I recognise this but I still feel like, hmm.. I don't have much of a point in carrying on. Even if I do graduate and so on, what for? Sure I enjoy doing these things but it doesn't seem to outweigh this crushing feeling I have. I'd really like to just stop living, not actually kill myself and destroy the lives of others.

* Are you diagnosed as neurodivergent? If so, what form?  
 
* Do you have any diagnosed mental illnesses?    
 
* What is your sexual identity? e.g. heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, asexual, pansexual, etc.  
 
* What is your romantic identity? e.g. heteroromantic, homoromantic, biromantic, aromantic, 	etc.  
 
* What is your gender identity? 	e.g. man, woman, nonbinary, agender, genderfluid, etc.  
 
* Are you transgender or cisgender?  
 
* Do you use neopronouns?

Important, heavy thing. So I'm already fighting to just keep breathing this month. It's been worse then your run of the mill melancholy filled times.

But then I'm at a family dinner tonight, and I'm not even really talking, mostly just listening to my brother and a family friend chat about politics and I occasionally would ask a question or chuck in a statement and my Dad kept putting his hand in my knew and shushing me (not odd behaviour between him and I, but that's a whole other fucking post)
But anyways, this started to mute me cause I normally feel like no one wants to hear me talk, but anyone who has experienced this kinda passive aggressive shit, knows how horrid it feels.

Then my Uncle takes me plate and I say ""Thank you so much"" to then get talked at harshly for 10 minutes by my Aunt and Uncle about how they hate that term and it is correct to use ""Thank you very much"" and I just, I just hit breaking point. 
I got up, walked out and got in my car and cried the whole way home.

"Looking for support in hard times.I have survived a suicide attempt that i did mid-summer, and I often think of doing it again. Need support since I dont have many friends, and I feel like no one really cares about me. I just want a hug from anyone who can say it giong to be ok i am here for you, and that they actually care and are willing to be there for me when i need it. I often wish that my suicide attempt succeded, and i was free from all this pain and i cold actually be happy for once."
Please tell me why I shouldn't do it.My life is shit.  Recently it got a lot shittier and it will only get worse.  I don't want to keep living like this.  I hate when I'm sober.  I only have a few hours before someone will be able to stop me.  Please talk to me.

"I'm really not sure why I'm bothering with life anymore.I hate myself, I don't even exist. 
I'm just a veneer of happiness over a body of depression.
never been diagnosed, don't think I need to be. I'm doing terrible at school and cant pass an exam for shit, I never used to fail exams. My friends are peeling off, I had a huge a argument with my parents tonight about what seems like nothing. There isn't a single aspect of my life I'm enjoying right now and I just want it to end.
I can't imagine how nice it would be not having to worry about all the shit in my life.

"I'm very tired.Maybe someone here can convince me that life in general is worth continuing with. I'm 21 this year, and I've been more or less a shut-in loser for three years. I left high school after realizing I simply lacked the ability to be around large groups or even do something so simple as speaking to people. My only interaction with other human beings comes from contact with people through text online, and rare trips out of my bedroom to get food or other needs.

I'm a disgustingly hilarious parody of the basement dweller trope, albeit outside of a basement. I'd be satisfied with this if it weren't for the fact that every day is the same thing. I wake up, do whatever, then go to sleep. Wake up, do things, go to sleep. Every day has been the exact same thing, and every time I try to muster up the will to go out and actually do things, I fail.

What is there in life for someone like me, exactly? At this point, I'm willing to die just to avoid a life full of disappointing others with my worthless personality."

"What's so good about being alive anyway?This pointless, fleeting thing we call life our brains make us cling to for some reason. What the fuck is so good about that anyway?

"I don't even know anymoreHey guys and gals. Sorry to bother you here but I've been sitting here talking to myself for the past half hour and I thought maybe it would be better if I talked to a computer and didn't look totally insane. So...yeah. I've been thinking about killing myself a lot lately. I'm not really sure why but it seems that my life is falling apart a bit. I just ended a  year long relationship (it was mutual, we had been going on for too long with neither of us getting anything) and that in and of itself was pretty hard. I feel really stressed but at the same time unmotivated to resolve any of the problems that are stressing me out. I've returned to self harm recently and I don't even know why. It doesn't make me happy or sad, it just feels like nothing. I feel like I could drop off the earth and nobody would notice. And that's a stupid thought I know but I can't help it. I recently talked a friend out of suicide so I'm trying to keep an eye on him while at the same time feeling so guilty about my suicidal thoughts. Like, if I can't control myself, how can I help my friends? I've been having weird flashbacks to my sexual assault which isn't helping matters and sometimes I think I'm going crazy. I think I'm starting to hear voices in my head, but I know it's my own voice. I know it's my voice telling me to jump into the middle of the road or self harm or anything else really. And it's also my voice telling me that killing myself is a pretty stupid idea. I think I'm going insane and that's freaking me out and I don't know what to do. Seeking professional help isn't an option at the moment and God knows if anyone will see this. Sorry for taking up your time and sorry for rambling but hopefully posting this will help me feel a little bit better"

"Iâm lostIâll spare the details and long sob story but basically the average bad childhood, bad family life, been fucked over by anyone Iâve ever let into my life.

I hate my life, I hate the person I was and am I feel so guilty about horrible things I did in the past and I feel like I could never live down I donât want to be me. Realistically no one really wants to die they just donât want to live the life they have I just canât stand being me itâs so draining I feel so worthless and like such a piece of shit from awful things Iâve done in my past I donât know how to live like this just hating myself and everything I ever was I donât want to be me I donât want these drowning feelings I feel like I can never get out of this endless pit of pain, guilt, and abuse Iâve went through.

"Just read I have bad grammar so excuse thatEver since I was in primary school I've been bullied, the first instance I can remember was being pushed over by a kid called Mathew, I was walking down a path and all of sudden he just shoves me, I don't react other then with just laying face first in the ground crying, I for sent too the principles office and got told it was my fault. I remember being stuck in what's essentially a glass box for the whole day, and throughout my primary school years this would happen nearly on a daily basis just being locked up in this glass box I never got school work in the room so I was weeks behind in school work, one time I remember I was in that room for 5 school days straight because I couldn't do my maths work, it was there fault I couldn't do it yet they blamed me, another time when I was actually out of that room I got mobbed by about 20 kids , I was in I think year 5 and they were in year 7. I tried too run but I just couldn't get away from them, I did smash one of there faces into a drink fountain, knocked both his front teeth out. The rest I don't remember because I think I got knocked out. But I remember after being in the office with a bloody nose and cuts and bruises all over me. Now at home during this time it wasn't much better both my mum and dad were addicted too Xanax and various other hard drugs like heroin one day my dad killed a aboriginal guy, he fell asleep while driving my mum's car and hit and killed him, when the police raided my house they found a meth lab and we got kicked out, I also watched my dad beat the shit out of my mum more times then I can remember, he broke her nose multiple times and then would direct his anger onto me when it wasn't my mum, my brother was treated like a golden child and he got everything, I was alone and had no one so I would go out the back and climb this massive tree we had just too get away from everything. Now as I entered high school the bullying got worse I was basically bashed on a daily basis or I would get help up by the throat constantly as well. I remember one time I got hunted by about 5 kids from various years some of them were year 12s. Luckily I hid and then left school that day, I can't imagine what would have happened if I didn't. I got myself kicked out of that school because I couldn't handle all the bullying. I then moved too a different school and the same bullying happened I had people throw chairs at me push me down the stairs and just hit me for nothing, i cane home crying every single day with bruises all over my body around the time I was in year 9 my dad got out of prison, and it was great he hadn't changed but I missed him, but then he started getting violent again about a year after he got out he tried too bash me he is much much bigger then me and I just ran down my street and stayed in a park for the night, I came back the next morning and everyone acted like it didn't happen, another time he cornered me and just started swinging, and didn't stop my mum tried too pull him off me and she got smashed into a wall, the police did nothing because we had no proof, bruises weren't enough. 

I'm gonna leave this here because this is already really long but if you want the rest message me and I'll tell you what happened after."
"I just want to know that there a good people out thereI have a pretty bad lung disease that is going to end up killing me.. I got a message from this stranger. He went through my posts and saw I was sucidal and chronically ill... I guess I just need help knowing that there are still good people in the world... I got on my throwaway to make this post.. I blocked him on my other one but he made my anxiety so bad. He sent a long message telling me how to kill myself and that I would be doing the right thing ending my suffering. It just broke me and my mind is spinning out of control. I have bpd and my emotions feel more intense than the normal person... Idk this is probably dumb to post.. but I just want someone to tell me this world isn't that cold.

I am exhausted and burned out (I get pushed around n shit at home) noone ever reaches out to me only one friend does talk to me everyday but I stopped tell her when I have these days as I feel like a burden. I made a friend on reddit and it was awesome someone new in my life, today out of the blue she left me and blocked me.... i sleep only three hours a day cause even in my dreams I get told to kill myself.... 

I been broken for years (when and how my fiancee left me) 

I always wanted a dog (when I played with my cousin dogs I'm at peace) but im not allowed a dog at home. Im 30/M but where i live it is hell expensive to afford a place rent or own and Covid didnt help at all.

I honestly feel like killing myself will finally give me the peace I want, no more broken feeling, knowing I'm a failure and let down.... I am just extremely tired.

Thanks for reading...."
"Today for the first time I felt down around friends.Like a lot of you guys I have some pretty self destructive thoughts most days. I have become very efficient at filling my day with distractions. It's mostly mindlessly browsing Reddit, playing video games, binging stuff Netflix or hanging with friends.
In the last few weeks I've lost all interest in video games and Netflix. I'm even getting bored of reddit.

I was fine with all that because I still had my friends, good supportive group of people. I've pretty much spent this entire day just hanging but something was different. For the last few hours I've been having these really bad intrusive thoughts that only happened when I was alone. I'm rambling now but what I'm getting at is it scares me. I thought I had the coping mechanisms down but they're all failing me one by one. I just don't know anymore."
"I want to give up on life.I am 27, gay, jobless, and single. I moved from India to the States hoping to give myself a fresh start after a rather tumultuous childhood and teenage years trying to identify myself and pushing myself to fit in among people who dismissed me as being different. Among a Muslim family who do not know that I am gay. I am jobless today in a foreign land surviving on the last couple dollars I have and I keep getting rejected at job interviews. And for the record I have a masters in Electrical Engineering, something that I am not so passionate about but was hoping to switch careers once I gained my grounding here in the US. Nothing that sort happened. Life just pushed me back into the darkness yet again. I donât feel like going back home because I failed myself, my parents, and everyone who hoped that I would make it big. Never happened. I feel like a corpse starting to rot. No one to talk to about how I feel, I am lonely as shit. I try pushing myself with hope but things just donât seem to be happening.

I want to give myself some rest. I am drained both mentally and physically. Giving up is the only option I see for some reason.

I hate how I'm unlovable and have no qualities that would make someone even pretend to care about me. I hate how I'm disposable. I hate how other people can at least charm or manipulate others into liking them but I can't even do that.

I'm so fucking sick and tired of being alone and scared shitless and constantly in danger and helpless to do anything about it. I'm so fucking sick and tired of the worry and the pain and the nausea and the crippling anxiety and the night terrors and the fight to survive physically and emotionally. I'm so fucking sick of being used and made a laughingstock and a scapegoat and target practice for other sick depraved individuals. I'm so sick of hating and being hated. I'm so tired of it *never* ending.

I didn't even make the decision to be here but somehow I'm the selfish person for wanting to leave.

What can I tell myself so that I *don't* chicken out this time?

I'm so fucking done.

"Iâm 15 and ruined my life my only option is to die and I canât do thatSo in January 2015 I found out I could force days off school then the day after that faked tearing my thigh muscle and managed to get a month off school, then when that month ended I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes which made me have even more time off making it even harder to get back afterwards although for the rest of that year at school (7) I managed to keep an ok attendance and everything was working out then in July 2015 I started to drop off with managing my diabetes which then caused me to lose motivation then in September 2015 I had another month off school, that was the first time I felt suicidal although that didnât last long and everything (except my diabetes which got way way worse) started to improve until after Christmas, in January I had another month off school which caused me to officially drop out in February which is when everything started to fall apart, I started pushing away my at the time girlfriend became essentially a hermit  let my diabetes get worse and basically did everything in my power to make myself worse 2 months later I lost 3 of my 4 best friends (the one I didnât lose being my ex) then just preceded to feel sorry for myself for the next 3 months when I became friends with someone I used to hate whoâs now my co best friend (co with my ex) after that nothing changed until January 2017 when I decided to try and get back to school that didnât work out at all and I just got worse afterwards after that nothing changed until June when I started being even more of a wanker to my at the time girlfriend by stopping talking to her and carried on doing that until October when I started talking to her again in December we got back together and I got a job although me and her only lasted throughout December, in January I badly injured my foot which got infected gave me sepsis and nearly killed me (typical of my luck that it didnât ð)  and I quit my job not long afterwards in March I got back with my ex  and I stopped pushing her away but still wasnât anything close to a proper boyfriend but between March and may was the best period of time Iâve had for years and in May someone kissed her and that was the ""final nail in the coffin"" between us in that way although weâre still best friends but it got to the point where the last thing keeping me going was me and her and now itâs gone Iâve lost all hope because nothings fixable anymore but Iâm too fucking pathetic to even kill myself I went out to jump in front of a car which sounds stupid but still and I didnât even have the balls to do it and I donât know what to do because I canât go back and fix things no matter how much I wish I could and I canât and I canât end it but at the same time I canât carry on because Iâm basically dead anyway all I do is listen to music and watch movies"

There are different people in my life and different things I would want to say to each of them. I've been thinking of leaving several notes and sending them to those people as letter on my last day.
Holy fucking shit do I hate finishing stuff I won't be able to do this thing for Christmas cause I'm going to be visiting my grandparents so I'll have to delay it a while too
"I didnt go to school today, here is why Because it is quarantine, and there is no school to start with.


Have a nice day."
"Any good pills to take to off myself?!I know this aint exactly the right place, but there is nowhere else i know where i can ask this. I just want to know what pills to mix to off myself."
"Haha shit I'm losing my fuckin mind manI'm just sitting here at lunch in my school with my head down and my thoughts feeling like a clogged toilet, as usual. Like damn if I could just die right now I'm gonna dance in the void that I'll be in. My whole existence is pointless and I will never go anywhere in my life, everything is going to come to an end anyways but pain is keeping me alive. Hey like I'm ready to for my conscience to just vanish I won't have to go through the effort of offing myself. If I hurt myself little by little will I build up tolerance? I am a disappointment breaking my promises no matter how small ha I'm a piece of shit this whole world is so horrible, trying to get out of here, here being my body and this Earth I'm ready to fucking go yknow"
"Why the fuck is social media like this? So my cousin who is 14 got obsessed with looking into serial killers, and read books like the darkling, shit with damon salvatore, and other books with edgy men in them. All of this was because of social media, and how it influenced her to think like this. She thought it was cool and constantly went on about how ted bundy was hot. She then met a 23 year old man. She thought he was cute, and GOT IN HIS FUCKING CAR. She then was kidnapped and raped over the course of 2 days.

Stop pushing the narrative that dangerous men are hot. Itâs fucking scary, and most of the people that think so are girls under the age of 18. Media is what starts this shit. Fucking stop, joking or not."
"I wanna kill myself but also notLong story short: Grew up with an alcoholic dad. My dad's parents where alcoholics themselves until they actually drank themselves to death pretty quickly. My uncle (his brother) drinks, too. It's a family issue. I made the decision to don't touch that stuff any further after the first try-out as a teenager. I could feel that alcohol and me is no good mix. My mom was co-addicted. She did let all that shit happen and never left him. She only ever threatened him to do so and he just had to cry and promise he would stop tomorrow, or next week or whenever and all that shot did go on and on and on. 



He was also never there for me although I was mainly HIS LOVECHILD. My mom already had two girls and would have been fine with no further kids. He was also happy with me being a girl. And he didn't want me anymore. He always said he said he loves me, and to be honest, he was the only person of the family who ever said those three words to me and would give me a hug, but then ran away again at the very moment. My mom was so frustrated about my dad that she was mad all the time, she always said and did mean things to me, sometimes she would join my dad drinking and 'cause she wasn't used to those amounts of alcohol she would vomit all over the bathroom and then I either had to clean it up or hold my piss until the next day and last but not least, as soon as I was a teen she give up on my dad and let me babysit him. Main problem was that he would always fell asleep drunk with a cigarette and let that fall to the ground. One morning there was a big whole burned into the carpet. Really really good luck that the fire stop by itself somehow. So, since I didn't look forward to die in a fire, I did babysit him the whole night long. Sitting next to him with all of his different moods. Aggressive (though he never hit me or so), depressive, sad, mean, disgusting. One night he cried like a baby how shit everything is and that he can't and doesn't wanna stop drinking. 



That was too much for me and during that time I started to have panic attacks. I dropped out of school and had to do psychotherapy. It never realy helped that much, maybe 'cause I never adressed the alcoholism in my family. It was a taboo. Other than yelling at each other every once in a while 'cause we couldn't take it anymore, we kept silent. Living in denial. My aunt (his sister) played a big role as well. She was quite a bit the self-proclaimed leader of the family. She was pretty strict about us having to shut our mouths. My mom asked her for help several times ans she got extremly aggressive about it. My other uncle (their brother) was in therapy as well 'cause of their drinking parents and kept it a secret from everyome else but me and my mom 'cause he was afraid of his siblings reaction. 



I finally reached out to my older halfsisters (booth over adecade older than me, we have the same mom but all different dads, though the dad of one is also the step-dad of he other which she sees as her real dad). Biggest fault ever in my whole life! They have huge problems with our mom, for a good reason, but instead of helping me getting rid of my anxiety disorder which would enable me to get rid of my parents, they put all their energy into stirrung me up against our mom. They told all evil things my mom did to them - just imagine me: I was sitting in psychiatry, which they put me into, crippled with anxiety from head to toe - and all they did was keeping on tellin me: Mom did this! And that! Bla bla bla... And some stories where even FAKED! The worst one was where they used a closed family friend for a fake story who actually comitted suicide! 



Of course this DIDN'T heal my anxiety, so I went back home. Because thruth to be told, my anxiety was so bad at that time, I was unable to live alone. My sisters told me at that time it's OK. Sister #2 told me she'd be going on vacation. Then her number didn't work anymore. For YEARS sister #1 told me everything's fine and that sister #2 is just so busy. I was stupid for long enough but then it wasn't possible to lie to me anymore, so sister #1 told me: sister #2 wants no contact to me until I move out and cut all ties to our mom. THAT IS EMOTIONAL BLACKMAILING!!! Especially 'cause I was NOT ABLE  to move out! I had anxiety and I was broke. They never had any issues with anxiety, they have a loving dad who always gives them money when needed and they pretty much never had to live alone by themselves since they always jump from one relationship/marriage right into the next. And she didn't atleast tell me that face to face! She always let's other people deliever their messages. Also really mean ones. When my anxiety was getting better I let out niece ask her (I cannot contact her directly, she even blocks me on FB) if we could met somewhere else, where our mom isn't present. She let my niece deliver me the message that even that is impossible, 'cause as long as I haven't cut tie with our mom, I'm contaminated to her. I feel DISGUSTING since that! 



And if that wasn't enough my dad chimes in. I was finally fed up with his alcoholic antics. Since he left my mom for a better co-addict and actually left his child as well instead helping me going through therapy at least one little bit, he treats me like shit. He disappears and then reappears all of the sudden, meeting me and making me hopes again, only to let me down 5min before our next meeting. Drunk-calls. Driving drunk with me. I started visiting Al-Anon which he got very angry about. Then he drops the next blackmailing: NO CONTACT UNTIL I ADMIT THAT HE IS NO AND NEVER WAS AN ALCOHOLIC. On my 30st birthday he send me a message: ""Happy birthday, darling! I'd be so happy to hear from you as soon as your ready to admit that I'm not an alcoholic!"". 



I also cut ties with sister #1 and my niece 'cause I couldn't take it anymore how they always protect sister #2's behaviour, not understanding my pain due to my dad and saying really mean things about that, like I would be a good thing if he drunk-drives himself to death because I'd get the money then, and concentrating everything on our mom (again, yes she was a bad mom, but that is something I can actually deal with, my emotional distress comes from that other things). 



So... long story short didn't really work, however... this is my life at 30 now! A FUCKED UP MESS! And I see no light at the end of the tunnel, and if it rather seems to be the light of the train riding over me. 



I was born as a happy baby. Bright. Defiantly shy and introverted, yes. But creative. I was into so many creative stuff beginning from a young age and I had so many and such big dreams. I know that Iand only myself are responsible for me but I'm also just human like anyone else and I need only a little bit of love and support. Not even much, just a tiny bit. 



Therefore I dunno if I can keep on living. I WANT to and make all my dreams come true, but even if I would make to technically, like getting rid of anxiety, having a job and move out with my mom: Just HOW could I ever become happy after all this shit? Memories about this will never fade and scars never heal. All those lost time. My niece said to me 'cause I'm 30 I'm old and already wasted most of my live (as if this is all my idea) so I should finally start living until I'm 6ft under anyway. At the moment wish I'd rather be 6ft under RIGHT NOW. I feel so stressed 'cause of this. My heart is pumping and head hurting like shit all the time. I also blame myself so much. I shoud have go to someone when I was 16 or so and asked to be put in a foster home. Or at least not waste so much time trying to keep the family together instead of just fuck them, get into psychiatry as long as needed, sacrifice my dreams and just get a shit job that is enough to pay a rent and then just leave them and call it day. But no, I must be this fucking failure. I would like to try to live a happy life but I just feel like giving up and go just die..."

"my brother is allergic to pears he ate a pie thing with predominately pears in it two days ago and said it felt like there were toothbrushes rubbing on his throat, and his stomach started hurting as well. he had the bread from that pie again and felt no reaction. so now i'm just wondering ""why the FUCK would someone be allergic to PEARS of all things?"" so thats what i've got to say. i'm the ""brother can't eat pears guy"". and you know what? maybe i'm OK with that. it gives me a label, and labels are comforting. but i'm still confused why can't my brother eat pears."
"I think its timeI think its time for me to check out. I have no friends, few family, wife and kids. Kids is the hardest part. I'm getting a divorce after a long time and am currently disabled from the military. Ptsd is a bitch. I am thinking that its the right time now. Within a week to get stuff in order. I have a plan and the supplies to quietly slip into oblivion. I will not say my plan or give it out. I hate what has become of my life. Ive had a crap existence my whole life. I cant stay and suffer. It will not get better imo ive been waiting a long time for that."
"Hi, just dropping something off I needa say somewhere. Hi there. This might come across as a rant or like I'm depressed or some shit but that is not the case. 

Earlier today my insanely disorganized, un-functional had yet another argument. It's kinda driving me crazy cause nobody else really seems to care about anybody and just use the other people for their own benefit.

Now I'll admit I'm slightly at fault there but, I still cared about everyone. Yes I said cared. After today I had another one of those realizations asking myself why I was still apart of a group that didn't care about me? Well tbh I don't know. The only real, true friend I have ended up leaving the group, which is really just a discord server at this point. 

In doing so I was left completely alone with people who have really never cared about me the same way I cared about them. Seeing this hurt cause for 2 years I thought I had friends. 

I'm gonna be a senior this year and I am absolutely horrible at making friends. I don't really tell many people this but I have insane anxiety that I don't usually control. It kinda controls me. Which is why it was so devastating seeing none of these people actually cared for me, when I had tried so hard to be a person they could trust and love. 

I could get more into but at this point in time I'm feeling slightly better from saying what I did say. 

The reason I marked this as social is I wanna know if you guys have had similar experiences. Lmk :)"
"Last checkup post for tonight This is my last checkup post tonight! 

Makes me feel really happy when I make others happy. Just posted about this but Iâm doing again because sometimes people wonât see my post, and those same people might really need a pat on the back.

Are you all doing alright? I enjoy doing this little checkups because seeing you guys happy makes me feel good. You deserve to be happy. If you need a compliment, some encouragement or just a pat on the back, leave a comment or DM me depending on your comfort level. I just want to make as many people happy as possible. It always sucks when youâre going through hard times, and I want to help, at least just a little, because sometimes we just need that little push to get us going."
"I overdosed on some pills last night and it's the best I've felt in so long.I have a horrible headache, I've felt nauseous all day, and I couldn't sleep at all last night. It felt like I was losing control of my throat muscles and I couldn't swallow anything for a little while. But you know what? I didn't spend last night or this morning depressed. I was thinking about the overwhelming pain I was feeling physically and not emotionally, and it was so nice. I didn't overdose to kill myself, I don't really know why I did it. But I'm glad I did it, because for one day(for most of it anyway) I didn't think about wanting to die.

Nothing makes sense to me anymore."

"HelpI donât know why everyone at school hates me. I donât know what Iâm doing wrong. I just wanna be more than a nobody and people just treat me like shit. They call me ugly and unathletic. Itâs because theyâre right. Iâm ugly and short and not muscular enough. I feel like I donât wanna live anymore. I have barely any friends and people think Iâm a joke

"Iâm done with trying to feel betterThe only reason Iâm still alive is because I know my mum will be devastated if I ever killed myself. If she ever passes while Iâm still in this state Iâm not going to hesitate on ending my own life shortly after. 

Iâm almost 23. I take my meds. I go to therapy. Nothing seems to help enough. I just donât want to be around anymore. I hate feeling like this, I wouldnât wish this upon my own enemy. My brain feels like itâs constantly like a static tv here it wonât shut up from all the overthinking I do. I think Iâm running out of options. I donât see myself living past 25. 
I just got accepted into a health science degree but I donât even know if I wanna try. I know Iâm smart, but my mental illness holds me back to where I think I canât do anything and Iâm not good enough.

I hate being serious online but I have to vent somehow so fuck it."
"Drowning is starting to sound niceI recently experienced my first severe manic episode. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder II a few years ago but I never had a high this bad. I was even hearing things that weren't there. I know that when I come back down I'll be thrown into the pits of depression. I've been in touch with my therapist and psych but in the dead of night my brain sometimes tells me to go jump into the nearby river. I can't swim so if I jump off the dock I will probably drown. 

Thing is, I'm super close to graduating college and can't afford to be hauled off to the shitty mental hospital nearby (I've been there and it was a complete waste of time and money). If I go now, I won't finish school and my parents and I can't scrounge up enough cash (even with loans) to pay for another semester. 

My antidepressant was recently halved to make the lithium more effective. I was sick and in pain for a week, then had a migraine for two days. Health-wise it seems there's always something wrong, but I'm only 23. I sometimes feel like I could save myself a life of potential suffering and help my parents get a better return on what I perceive as being a bad investment (me). I'm already on year 5 of college because of a similar event where my roommate talked me into getting help when I planned to hang myself.

This is kind of unrelated but I'm also a lesbian and while both of my parents love me, my mom still hasn't fully accepted that part of me even though it's been 6 years. I'm really tired of hiding it from extended family but I know verbal and maybe even physical fights will breakout in my family if everyone knew, and my parents would take most of the blame. I've also had body image issues ever since a stupid doctor put me on a medicine without telling me rapid weight gain was a common side effect. I put on 50 pounds in the past year and am now considered pre-diabetic with my current A1C.

I'm not about to do this tonight but it's been playing on my mind more and more. The crying spells and mood swings are getting out of hand and I've already made use of many of my college's resources. I feel bad asking any more of my friends and my family doesn't know enough about my illness to support me in the ways I need right now. I've attempted suicide before with pills. It was of the biggest mistakes I ever made. I feel so stuck...please convince me that this is a terrible idea.

TL;DR: Mania and health problems suck and I can't afford to take off school anymore. Please convince me that drowning is a bad idea."
"Iâve had a bad day I know this probably wonât get seen since there are thousands of members on this subreddit, but I need to get this off my chest.

My bad day started when I was in science. Keep in mind that my teacher barely teaches us shit, and we have to rely on notes in a format all of us hate to survive. I recently took a quiz, and failed it. My teacher called us illiterate yesterday since we âdidnât read the instructions properly.â Today we got it back and I missed most of the questions. This made me feel very bad, since I usually get straight Aâs. 

In the middle of class, he got a phone call and answered it. They told him to send me to the office and to take my stuff. I put my things in my locker assuming I was going to get talked to.

I got to the office and my momâs coworker (she works in the kitchen)  was there talking to the secretary. She told me to get whatever school stuff I need for the next 2 weeks.

My momâs other coworker had tested positive for COVID and my mom had gotten herself a rest too, which turned out positive. 

Now, I have to quarantine for 3 weeks, at the beginning of a new quarter where my classes are going to get harder, and my teachers barely post anything on google classroom, so Iâm not sure whatâs going to happen to my grades.

In my opinion, the worst part is going to be breaking the news to my friends. Weâve been best friends since 4th grade and had plans for Halloween that we were so excited for and now we canât do anything.

If youâve made it to the end of this post, thank you for listening. Iâm not asking for anything too fancy or a huge pity party. Iâm just asking for some advice or comments to make this crappy day better. I wrote this post to vent, and since Iâm done, I hope you all have great days."

"Summer InternshipsI have been applying to summer internships for months now and have had a lot of interviews but no job offer. I applied to a job posting Monday that was posted last Thursday \[4/2/20\] that I felt confident about as my resume aligned with all of their wants for a intern, but today I saw that the job was ""no longer accepting applications"" and now I think that the they went with another candidate, but the posting had only been up for 7 days and I saw that they edited the posting on Monday so they must have been considering candidates at least until Monday so that was only Monday to Thursday 3 days to find and interview a candidate and choose them? That is a extremely fast turnaround. That makes no sense to me and I feel like I am at my breaking point with everything as I feel like everything is going wrong."

Donât feed me the âIt gets betterâ bullshit, because I know it doesnât. I have nothing to make me unhappy, and plenty of things to make me happy, but Iâm still totally fucking miserable. As I said I have a girlfriend, plenty of normal friends that Iâm very close with, great relationship with both my parents, get good grades. Iâm not sick, or poor, or disabled, or bullied, but I still feel totally miserable. If this isnât enough to make me feel happy, then what is?"
"Pointless... Fml24/m.  Yesterday night, my family and I went to the movies. My mom took me to watch ""Instant Family"" with Mark Wahlberg. It was a cheesy movie. My mom took me so that would cheer me up but throughout the movie I felt nothing, I felt emotionless. Movies, even cheesy ones always made me laugh, cry, whatever. But I was just not feeling anything. I just felt so cold and empty. My life is in shambles, everything has fallen apart since I graduated college, no friends to hangout with. No purpose. What was the point of all of that, to get a degree? I don't know what to do with myself, trying to figure myself out. The only way I sleep is thinking about throwing myself off a cliff. I feel like I lost it all, I have no motivation to do anything anymore and I WANT to die. What's the point of life? I can't even feel emotions anymore, no happiness. It's too late for me, this husk of a body. An empty shell of what used to be there...

"Music and the apocalypse
I deleted this before after getting downvotes (not sure why) but I still feel terrible so Iâm reposting in the hopes that anyone can help.

Music has, sincerely, been my life. I dedicate most of my free time to making it and listening to it.

Iâll put it this way: America is crumbling and protesters are being disappeared in unmarked vans. Okay, at least we have art to turn to, right? Well, not really, because all our artists are rapists. I guess we can just make art ourselves, right? Well, not really, because every venue in America is going to be shut down, ruining the livelihood of virtually every musician who isnât a stadium-filler. Uhh well things can always get better, right? Well, no, because we live in a rapidly declining nation that - best case scenario - will be subject to worse famine and plague than itâs ever seen before as climate change worsens, destroying our food supply and unleashing diseases trapped under the Arctic ice. Worse case scenario, we go extinct!

I guess my question here is, why donât I hang myself and get that out of the way quickly?"

"For the people who have 3 am motivation I wish ya the best, and try to get some school work done"
"Not existing is an extremely attractive idea.24m. Iâm definitely too much of a pussy to actually kill myself (for all of the normal fucking reasons, not trying to hurt the people that love me etc.). Thatâs why I let my actions and inactions slowly destroy my health and relationships, because self-sabotage is my default setting. It would be so much easier to do it without guilt if people disliked me. I donât have the will or desire to actually end my life, but I have let habits form that will surely lead to my own suffering and early demise. Not only is there zero motivation to change this, itâs actually an ATTRACTIVE idea that I would die sooner from natural or semi-natural causes. I even find myself hoping I get cancer or some other horrid disease naturally, so I donât have to finish the job myself. It follows that this is a disincentive to see any sort of doctor or health professional, in addition to being a disincentive to any sort of self improvement at all. Iâm also 99.99% sure that the afterlife is equivalent to the before-birth, so I have no fear of what will happen âafterâ death. This eternal sleep is very, very attractive but not quite so that I will turn the vast uncertainty of life into the certainty of non-existence in a single moment. Plus, if there is a God and he wants to punish me in Hell for dereliction of his âcreationâ or whatever bullshit religious people come up with to keep people from killing themselves, then fuck him for making me in the first place. I just donât care. This is my version of suicide, a prolonged downfall not only from lack of motivation to improve my life but a perceived incentive to sabotage it. And if you think this is some long-winded bullshit that says and accomplishes nothing, youâre absolutely right.

"Plan, Execute, Bleedout.It's bad today. There's no real reason or difference, everything environmentally is sound. It's just bad today. Even writing the word suicide gives me a jolt. I can't tell you any triggers, any lingering thoughts, nothing I'm dwelling onâ it's just bad today. I don't really want to kill myself on my sisters birthday. But being alive tomorrow seems like such an impossibility... it's terrible to think ""My life is perfect, I've had everything with such fucking ease, and I want to die."" I apologize constantly like a retard. The guilt is extreme. I don't want to ruin lives, I just don't want to live mine. I've seen four counselors, three psychiatrists, taken 5 different meds, and I just want it to be done. Just end it, please, for fucksake, end it. The voice inside my brain is fed up. Get your gun, drive out to the lake, and fire.      They tell you that if you have a plan, go to the hospital. If you have a method, go to the hospital. I don't want any more of that. I don't want any more. The greatest thing ever would be to not exist at all, so â for fucksake, end it."
"i hate everything about myselftrigger warning for self harm shit 

i know i shouldn't compare myself to other people but it sucks. they always say don't judge your life off someone else's social media, they just post the highlights. okay??? at least they have highlights. shit worthy to post somewhere. shit worthy of talking about.

i can't do shit. i'm below average (at best) at everything i do and am, no matter how fucking hard i try. i'm taking the same fucking math class for the third time now because i'm so fucking stupid. my 12 year old sister and 15 y/o brother are helping me with my fucking math homework.

i can't even say i'm doing anything productive ever because i don't even have a fucking job. my parents are paying for my math class, they're paying my probation officer, my court fees, everything. i owe them almost $1500 already and this shit JUST started. i can't even drive because i lost my license so i'm fully dependent on everyone. i hate it. i had more freedom in high school than i did now because i fucked up one night and it sent me into a fucking spiraling depression

i hate being sober. i hate it. i hurt myself so i can feel something. it gives me a high. i love it. my boyfriend hates it. i've made him cry because i do it. i hate that. all i do is disappoint him and everyone else who knows me . i've been trying desperately to talk to people i went to high school with and i was friends wit and none of them want to talk to me. i'm trying so hard to find reasons to not fucking off myself but i can't. i'm a leech i'm a disappointment i barely fucki g exist as it is i want it to be over with"
"My mental illness is taking control over my life and my family and bf are being affected by it. I just want to free them from the burden of having me in their lives.My partner of 2 years is the one who deals with my borderline personality often. Anything could cause me to split and suddenly hate him for no logical reason other than my emotional instability, and it just has worsened with the pass of the months. I know I have to get psychological help but it doesn't solve the problem immediatly. He would still have to deal with my mood changes until there is some significant improvement, and that may take years and years. 
The guilt that comes with this, knowing that with his own mental issues he's still trying to do everything to make me happy... It just destroys me and gives me an (apparently) justified reason to kill myself. So that he can move on from this toxic relationship and find someone healthy that will truly make him happy and give him all the positivity and love in the world. In this state of mind, I can barely reply to his ily's because of the amount of guilt. He says he's willing to stay with me and even pay for my mental health when he gets a job. This fucking tears me apart. How can somebody be so good with me when i've made his life impossible countless times, ugh.

My family doesn't know all the story behind my behaviour. My mother is the one who I turn to the most, but she doesn't understand how fucked up I really am. She just brushes it off saying the neurotypical arguments: ""It's just a phase, you'll get over it, there's people in the world with WORSE problems and you are getting sad out of nothing?!"" ...Well, yeah. That's why i'm asking for help in the first place. There's no fun in living like this.
On the other hand, my father said the same things as my mom, with the difference that he got me the number of a mental health center so that I can call and order an interview with someone and start treatment. I'm a little afraid about it tho, there's just too much happening right now and I would be ashamed to be seen in my lowest by a stranger. But I know It's part of getting help, opening up. 

Sorry for the wall of text, the typos and the incoherences, I just needed to vent somewhere."
"the dream i had today.... ok so it started off with me and some girl i have never seen before,we were talking about food and she told me about her fav snack saying that it was the best thing ever and stuff and then we went to store so i can get her the snack,when we got there she held it then her face changed,she put it back and grabbed some organic snack and i got super counfused,then i realised its because i have diabetes so i cant have sugar,and she wanted to get something we can eat togther......of course i woke up and realised how lonely i am........pain."
"Suicide seems like the best option.I have lived for 20 years on this earth, and these exhausting, painful years are not something I wish to live through again. All my life, I have engaged myself into a fever of academic ambitions and perfectionism, I lived in total darkness, seeing only what I thought existed, burrowing my head further and further into the soil until I was completely buried. Yet when I was pulled out, I did not bloom and bathe in the light, I found these new sights and gaudy colours frightening. Yet, one way or another, I could not dig only again into the ground, I could only lie low, my brain stilted, trying to slip quietly through life. 

I have failed abysmally at this. I have been wracked with depression for so long that I feel nothing, my mind has lingered, coma like, alive but not responding. Then the loneliness struck, so there I was, an atom amongst billions, with nowhere to go, and no one to guide me.

I am scared of death, yet I also welcome it. I have never been religious, but, even if there were an afterlife, how can my mind be reprogrammed and my thoughts untangled? How will I be judged? Am I an evil person because I have dragged so many people down with my with my depression, and practically ruined the bonds of my family? Perhaps, the most comforting view is that of an atheist, I shall lie under the soil with my flesh consumed by maggots and my bones melting into dust, and my mind, and these locusts which plague it, will rot away like another insignificant piece of organic matter. Finally, peace in the form of nothingness. 

I don't know, and I don't care. Perhaps I am a coward because I wish to 'take the easy way out'. Perhaps I am selfish for tormenting my loved ones. But one feeling which overwhelms all reason is a profound desire, ringing from the depth of my soul, for this pain to stop."
"I can't end it, but I want to.Hello, i'm sixteen years old and everyday that passes by, it becomes easier for me to accept suicide. The reason behind it is, I have had a long history of emotional abuse,anxiety,depression. Since middle school I have hated the way I looked, the way I felt but I always went to school with a fake smile and acted out as if nothing was wrong with my life. I get so self-conscious of how I present myself to others that I am now isolating myself so I do not have to deal with that problem anymore.

I started thinking about suicide during my first year of high school because I had a friend who would talk about that all the time. He is still alive today and is the smartest guy I know, I consider him to be my best friend. During those times he worried me a lot and kept saying he'll do it and how'd he do it. I never told anyone because it all started out as a joke but I don't know if he was trying to send out a message or wanted attention. Eventually everything went back to normal, still trying to get by every single day, trying to live with myself.

My mom and dad have always been supportive of me, always cared for me when I was hurt. Now I am bringing them into problems by being truant and running away from my problems. What I mean is I do not like public school, I hate it. Everyday I go it makes me tense and fear overcomes me. I hate to admit it but I realized that I may have been bullied from time to time by the people I cared about and other insignificant people that entered my life.

Back to the truancy thing my mom is going to court because of me. I keep telling her that it's not her fault but mine, but she keeps insisting that it's her responsibility and she has to take me to school. I don't want to go. I forgot to mention my parents are divorced and during those times I was a little kid too ignorant to know what was happening. Throughout the years I blamed myself, my mom, my dad kept asking myself why we couldn't be a happy family like my cousins and friends.

My dad has entered my problems now and is threatening me to take me to a reformatory because he thinks I don't know whats going on, what my actions are doing to other people. I already know what's going to happen and that's why i'm sad and scared. For the longest time I was under the notion that a beautiful girl would come and save me from my problems and we would fall in love and everything would get better. That never happened, and i'm too scared that whoever I speak to at school will think i'm a fool and i'm just another a self conscious teenager that has the same problems as anyone else. It makes me feel like i'm nothing.

Everything I wrote here are just some things that I happened to think of while writing this. I couldn't get my thoughts straight because right now i'm overcome d by fear, that the school will call my mother and ask her why i'm not there. I want these 2 years to pass so I can stop living this hell and start a new. Ofc I don't see a future for me right now and just me killing myself to end my problems that i'm creating for myself by not going to school and for my parents. I choose to forget everything that happened in the past and I didn't really write much about that here. just my current situation I feel like i have abandoned everything I loved and cared about for my own selfish wants and needs, I hate myself for that and I want to end it."
"i think my best friend committed suicide today i went home from school and found a text by my best friend. it wasn't a rare thing. the problem is that the text pretty much  looked like a suicide letter and was from 3 hours before. i imediately wrote him lots of messages trying to stop her. she still hasn't answered and i'm crying because i would never forgive myself for not helping her if she killed herself.  my bf tried to help me distract myself from what happened but it was pretty much useless. i'm incredibly scared and i wanted to talk about it with you all redditors. i'm not asking for karma or awards, i just want to distract myself a bit"

She was my everything, all I had in this world and she was taken from me and now im left with nothing and noone. I want to see her, kiss her and hug her so much it makes me cry all the time. I want to go in Heaven to see her. I want to kill myself. I have nothing, no education and no job. I cant live like this and knowing Ill have to live like this for next 50, 60 years makes me want to kill myself even more. For my dad im nothing, he wouldnt even shed a tear after I'm gone. I want to go to Heaven to see my mom, its the only thing I want, can I see her if I kill myself? I did everything right in life and I know I can go to Heaven. My biggest fear is Ill never see my mom if I kill myself.. I never sinned, can I go to Heaven if I kill myself? "

"I need help.I need help.  Iâve had depression issues since I was a child.  I had things happen during my childhood that I just canât bring myself to talk about out loud.  My father died a few years ago after a lifetime of cheating, lying, and doing terrible things to my mom and two sisters and myself.  Ever since he died I have had more and more bad memories coming out of the dark.  I just canât handle any more.  

My husband and I both work but we just canât get ahead.  I feel guilty for just existing, eating, being.  I have cried every day since November 2017.  Things have always been rough but holidays are awful, as yâall know.  But now itâs March and I still canât bear to face the day. 

My husband is wonderful.  He doesnât have a clue how bad off I am.  He has no idea I daydream about suicide.  He doesnât know most of what happened when I was young.  No one does.  I cover my sadness with fake smiles, and laughs.  I hate to bother anyone.  

Any of my friends, family, would be so shocked to hear this.  I put on an excellent smiley, happy front.  Iâm really, really good at acting like everything is great.  I force myself to complete the daily interactions needed of me.  Take the kiddo to school, Iâm a PTA mom, head of class parties, the âsoccer momâ that has it together, but Iâm honestly dying inside.  But my heart absolutely hurts.  I feel so broken with sadness.  

I need meds, I know I do, but itâs $200 just for an office visit at the local urgent care.  I canât bring myself to use two hundred bucks on myself.  I want to run far away and just be done but I canât do that to my child and my husband, so instead I sit here with more grief and sadness than I know what to do with.  

Thanks for reading.  If I did it, I would jump.  Jump and drown.  "
i want to overdose:I
"Can't convince myself that I shouldn't go buy a gun next weekYou know, Im honestly amazed at how quickly my average days can turn into shit ones. Today, it honestly took about 2 hours from the time of me waking up to the time where I wanted to make a noose in my closet. And it's my day off from work too. That's the best part, my brain loves to hit me where it hurts. It knows where all the weakest points are.

I'll be honest though, online dating will absolutely be the reason I fucking put a bullet through my cranium. Hell my depression and online dating are one in the same. They both let me know Im ugly, undesirable, boring, a waste of space and time, and a cyst on society's face. It's made even worse that today I finally got a match on this one dating app. Poor girl doesn't realize the sad fucker she just matched with. And you know, that part gets really old too. A match used to be ""Yay, a new person to talk to"" and now it's ""Alright, let's see how badly this is gonna fucking sting"". It just really exhausting beating myself up all the time.

Well if you made it through that, pat yourself on the back. Luckily, I live in the States and getting a handgun is pretty simple. Honestly, all I need to do to get a gun is pass some basic tests and then drop a couple hundred dollars. I mean, life honestly at this point feels like Im addicted to gambling and I've lost basically everything, but in my mind I tell myself that if I play one more hand/game that I can win everything back. But the odds are so stacked against me and who's to say Im gonna make it all the way back? Im boring, stupid, lame, scrawny, ugly, interesting as paint drying and all Im doing everyday is wasting the Earth's oxygen. Course though that second paragraph makes me sound like an incel, I mean, Im not because I know everything is my fault, it always is. I blame myself for my problems and I shoulder the blame for others so they don't have to. Fuck me for being selfless I guess haha. 

Also, I see my therapist in a week and half, but I'll be honest, I don't think Im gonna make it. I really feel like Im gonna run out of luck before then. And even when I go to her, Im never in a bad mood so it's hard for me to be honest. Also, in my mind if even mention the word suicide, she'll drop everything and have the cops come throw me in the psych ward. Although honestly, I'd actually prefer that because then it would really drive home the point that Im a broken, worthless, piece of shit person. 

Anyways, Im probably just gonna spend the day touching up my suicide note today. Probably the only thing I can do right but Im sure I'll find a way to fuck that up too."

"I'm so closeI cant take it. I'm staring at a noose and a blade but I dont have the courage. I've tried twice. Something keeps stopping me and I hate it. I don't know what ti do anymore. It feels pointless living. I just try and find something to keep me occupied until I can finally fall into an unrestful semi sleep state where life sucks just a bit less. Theres no point to any of it and I want it to end. I dont even know why I'm making this post. I dont want anyone I know to know. I've already been hospitalized once and I hated it. It never helped. It just helped me to hide it better. I guess I just want someone to know how close I am. It's just me and my dog. Shes my rock. If not for her, I would have done it already. I know my family would take care of her but it wouldnt be the same. I know it. She knows it. I think she knows and it breaks my heart. I just wish I had the courage."
"Right when I thought my life couldnât get any worse my grades come outThis is my first semester in uni and I had to do it online because of the whole Covid thing. And most my classes were really late cause I live in a different time zone and thereâs an 8 hour time difference so I never really got any sleep cause I finish classes at around 1-2 am and I have to wake up at 6:30 every morning for work and for the college here in my home country. Iâve been struggling with my mental health throughout the entire semester and it really effected how productive I was and I knew I wasnât gonna do well but I thought Iâd at least pass. I somehow managed to fail 4/5 subjects I was taking in the university and one of the two subjects I was taking in my college. And Iâm in a situation where I might get expelled from the university and Iâll have to stay here in a homophobic country (Iâm gay and if anyone here found out Iâll get the death sentence immediately because they donât mess around when it comes to these things) and that university was my only escape from here. 
I guess Iâm just at the point where not only do I not have any reasons to live but I also have a lot of reasons why not to live and the idea of finally doing it seems like the only solution now and is probably the only way out of this mess I put myself in. 
Thereâs no one to blame here but me because I obviously bit off way more than I can chew and itâs probably the main reason Iâm here right now. 
I guess Iâm just tired of waking up every morning and trying to get somewhere in life but I just end up setting myself further back with every passing day. 
I guess the only thing thatâs stopping me is the fact that Iâm scared"
"I am very depressed and have considered suicide. Can someone please help me to get out of this? (Read text)My life was OK when I was younger, except for the fact that my father was an alcoholic. I grew up with two siblings, one of which a half-brother. My father was a jerk most of the time, but worse when he was drunk. He would go after my half-brother a lot, because he wasn't related to my father. My half-brother moved out of the house when he finished high school because he couldn't take it anymore. They got into several fights before then. My other brother would also get into fights with my father. My mother couldn't stand him anymore. So when I was about 10-12, things started to go really crazy. My parents had a huge fight one night, and my father cut his arm with a knife deliberately to try to frame my mother (what a dick). This eventually led to a divorce. I finished sixth grade, which was a terrible year due to the divorce and bullying, and moved in with my father. I don't know why I chose to, I guess I was just stupid. My mother eventually moved to Pennsylvania to get farther away from my dad, and my dad moved to Baltimore. During school, I would visit my mother every other weekend which sucked major balls because my dad would always try to start fights with me by talking shit about my mother and half-brother. I had a lot of trouble fitting into the new school and I still do now. I'm currently 16 years old. I am afraid to talk to anyone in my school still. Also, my school is a majority black school so it's hard to fit in being white (I don't mean to offend any groups). I spend most of my time on the computer in my room or playing video games. I do have very few friends, but they hardly even talk to me anymore. I feel that I don't have any natural talents and won't amount to anything in the future. I don't know what career I want or what college I want to go to. I have never had a relationship in my life and that also affects my depression. Most kids at my age seem to be better off than me, by which I mean that they are either good at sports, have an artistic talent, etc. I have seen a therapist to help me with my depression, but that didn't really work. It now feels worse than ever. I just need help getting out of this depression and suicidal thoughts. I'm sorry about any bad grammar. I will answer any questions you have. I realize that my story may not be as depressing as others, but I still need help."
A small prediction I have for 2094. Queen Elizabeth II will be a vampire by that time and will have complete control of Britain.
I'm at my breaking pointI'm angry and lonely and feel like no one understands me. I'm at my breaking point and I'm about to lose it. If someone says one more stupid plattitude that everyone says to people experiencing a lot of emotional shit then I'm done. I'm no longer gonna even try to talk about my feelings and open up to anyone. I'm gonna end up doing something really bad. I'm gonna kill myself and that will be the end of it. I thought the whole point of opening up to people was so that you could find someone who's more understanding and and avoid people who are insensitive and who'll make things worse. Whatever dude I'm really close to being done right now.

The only person I have ever cared about made me promise not to kill myself.I donât know why I did it but after I attempted suicide I told the only person who I have cared about what I did.

"All my problems are invalidI just came to this realization on reddit. I realized that not only am I not actually as smart as I have been told I was all my life, but all those years spent suffering and being a general wreck were all just invalid. The stalking issues? Typical for an average male. The depression? I might as well be faking it. Social anxiety? Just mild autism. The only valid problems I have are OCD and Autism. I donât have PTSD or ADHD, just a social death sentence. All my problems that are a little valid were self-inflicted. I love being broken and damaged. My parents have wasted probably millions of dollars to find out what was wrong with me and to treat me. Iâm so paranoid and my victim complex is so big, that I think iâm oppressed or going to be oppressed as a white male. My life has been turned upside down, and iâm not exactly sure how I can go on. The guilt and shame I feel after doxxing, stalking, wasting millions, and generally being an asshole are so immense. I feel like I might kill myself tonight. 

So long."
"I canât take this loneliness anymoreI am not going to beat around the bush here. Yesterday I got banned from the only community where I was able to find people with the same interests as me. For the first time in years I had friends, friends with whom I could talk to about all kinds of things, and now, thanks to a single moment where I lost my patience, all that is gone. My performance in college also dropped tremendously compared to the last semester thanks to my awful new timetable. I canât even go back to the that community since they would be able to recognize my voice. I have never felt so lonely in my whole life. I am seriously considering taking my life tonight and I think this is the only place where I feel comfortable enough to seek help."

I can't even talk to my gf and that's the worst part about cuz she knows what's wrong with me and she's tried getting help for me but it never seems to help and I just can't take it anymore and so I plan on going out and buying a gun and ending it today."

"Everyday provides a new reason...I truly wake up most days with the hope that something positive will happen.  I value the little things that go my way.  Green lights, positive conversations with my daily, fantastic people...positive feedback through email at my job.

I have a million reasons that overcome me with sadness and fear. I have been a pretty good fighter and put on my game face for many sad events in my life.

Lately, I feel like money will always pain me. I am lucky in so many ways.  BUT, I CANNOT FIND ANYTHING to wake up for anymore. My strongest remaining family member, my rock, is deteriorating at a rapid rate and I cannot deal with this again. 

If I were not here, I wouldn't need to go to a job I am underpaid and under appreciated to do. I wouldn't need dental work that cost so much, even with top notch dental insurance. I wouldn't need to continue hanging on by a thread. I wouldn't need to be the idiot that changed jobs, after many years with a great company to do WHAT I LOVE. 

I am in the wrong place.  The wrong time. I kinda like me some days, but I am not a good fit for what pays the bills.  

Everyday it is easier to justify.  Life is cruel."
Trigger warning â ï¸ So I read a post on r/relationship_advice which inspired me to ask this question. Is it rape if a girl says no just at the moment you're about to cum and you don't pull your dick out?
"I feel like thereâs no point anymore.I donât feel like Iâm needed.
I donât think anyone REALLY wants me around.
I donât believe I need to be around anymore because Iâm just another girl.

There are plenty of girls like me.

Girls with frizzy brown hair and bad eyesight.
Girls that arenât exactly fit, but arenât âtightâ or hot either.
The girl that doesnât have any friends, but doesnât say anything either because sheâll be judged for it.

A mediocre cellist and composer.
A dreamer throwing her money away by following her diluted fantasy to be a musician.
A girl that fell in love with someone who she isnât even certain feels the same way.

I want to be needed.
I feel like Iâll never live up to everyoneâs expectations for me.
I donât feel good enough to be alive and Iâve tried to fix it, but itâs impossible.

"Gf's ex bf threatening suicideOk so basically I've (26m) been seeing my gf for a few months and before that she was in a relationship with another guy, which is in a different state now. Things weren't going good with him and he got kicked out of there living situation. She feels like he is her best friend and saved her life by brining her down here to get in recovery. They were both recovering drug addicts but since recently my gf has been relapsing and I'm pretty sure he has ever since he went back to where they came from. Anyway throughout 9ur relationship I have been understanding and have been fine with her talking to him even though he makes it clear that his intentions are to get her back. The other day he hung himself and was cut down in time to still be alive and know is facetimibg her pictures of ropes saying if she doesn't come back he will do it again. I do get that this is very hard for her and makes it feel like it's her fault, bit when she goes back to where she's from i know she will fall back into using and he will not let her leave. It just seems like he is using it to manipulate her and it's fucked up, I'm just wondering if you guys have any advice on how to go about this because she's planning on leaving in a couple days and I don't see it ending well

"There is no hope.I don't have anything. I will never have anything. I don't want anything. I don't want to die; I want to never had existed. I want to disappear. I often think about killing myself and last night I had an epiphany. I don't have to burden anyone with cleaning up my mess if I hang myself. I don't want to die, I don't want to kill myself, but it's looking like it would be better than living."
people on twitter attacking me when i genuinely donât think i did anything wrong iâve never had to deal with being attacked online until now. idk i feel like absolute shit and iâm crying. i feel like i genuinely try so hard to be a good person. but i still somehow ended up having a few people target me and twist my words and ended up shouting at me that iâm racist. i feel like shit. i feel like iâve been gaslit. or am i actually just wrong? i can link the tweets if you want to see. i kinda wish i had someone to help me tbh because iâm shit at defending myself. i feel so weak and especially because iâve never had something like this happen until now. i donât know what to do
"So uh...I'm a bit confused and i need answers. After all those ""Skinny boys are cute"" posts came from an 8 y/o account flaired as 13 (totally not sus or smth), are skinny boys still cute or nah?

"I really hate myself because I'm not capable of getting a girlfriend, and I just want to die nowI'm supposed to be in college right now, but I can't motivate myself to get out of the house cause all I can think about is how bad I want to die. I want to die because girls hate me, and it's been my dream to find my soulmate. I've tried and tried to get a girl to like me, but its all been in vein. After it became obvious that I just wasn't going to be able to get a girlfriend in my life, I tried to focus on just myself. However with that I just found that the empty feeling doesn't go away. I just really want to die, it really hurts not being good enough. It has driven me mad that a girl chose to give a guy that beats her a second chance over giving me a first chance. I'm so bad that girls would rather get beaten than date me. I've tried my hardest to find happiness in other things, but it just doesn't fill the hole. I just feel that if I keep living I'm never going to be able to accept that I'm lonely, hence why I'm better off just putting myself out of my misery."

"It just doesnât feel like I can make it through this timeI keep trying to tell myself that I have been through major depressive episodes before and have made it through to the other side. It just doesnât feel like Iâm going to make it out of this one. I feel so lucky to have some incredibly caring people in my life but Iâve just become such a burden on them in my downward spiral. My work is suffering and that makes me lose my confidence further. Iâve gotten so deep into this dark place and it truly feels like there is no way out. I genuinely do want to avoid suicide but it no longer feels like an option. I donât have money or transportation for therapy, and Im at a point where I feel like it would be a waste of resources. I know how much it would help my mother to receive my life insurance pay out. If there is any way I can access some method of convincing myself that life would be worth living, id truly be open to taking it. But itâs so far out of reach. Why work so hard to continue to live in pain."

"Conductor Karen Me and a guy I'm seeing was on our way to go home and so we took the train. 
And this little boy, he looked like he was about 7-9 years old, he was taking the train alone and he put his feet on the seat. (Idk if it was an accident or not, but I don't even think it matters here) 
This conductor started screaming at him. 
She told him to clean up after himself, because he had made the seat dirty. 
So she told him to clean it up with his....beanie ;-; 
And he said that he didn't want his beanie to get dirty. 
So she yelled "" This train will stop and won't go anywhere until you've cleaned it up! "" 
And then she started touching him, like idk grabbing his hands or sth. 
And he told her to stop touching him
So this one guy tried to move her and let him get past her so he could walk away from her but she refused to move. 
So I started to feel concerned and asked my boyfriend      "" Should we do sth? ""  Because I really wanted to help
And she heard me ;~;
So she said "" I've been telling a bunch of people lately to clean up after themselves, they were willing to and that was that, it doesn't matter if they're kids, this is not okay."" 
And she started to bother other people in the train, talking about it. 
And so me and my boyfriend started to look for paper so he could clean it up so she would leave him alone. 
We couldn't find any paper so we just gave him a bag and he cleaned up after himself. 
And this Karen said "" Thank you"" lmao, as if we care about her, we just wanted her to get away from him. 
When she finally had walked away from him he went to sit somewhere else. 
And she started to talk to us, idk why, and I just shook my head in disbelief and stuff. And she asked me
"" Oh so you think this is okay? ""
And I responded ""I don't think it's necessary for you to embarrass him and touch him"" 
And so she got  really mad
And then she started screaming at me "" You can sigh all you want, I don't care, it doesn't matter their age, they're supposed to know that you're not supposed to do that! "" 
And when we got out the train I felt so awful and worried for the little boy and I asked him if he was okay and he said yes.
I know he would've said yes either way but I just wanted to show him that there are people who don't judge him and care about him even if they don't know him. 
 I really hope that boy is okay."

"i just donât want to add any more pain to the worldBasically I (17m) donât want to live anymore. As one would assume, i guess, since Iâm on this subreddit.... the short version is Ive had on-and-off depression and suicidal tendencies for the past 7 years. Life hasnât been easy, either. My dad has severe PTSD and physical disabilities. My mom works a double full-time job. So I get to watch my 4 youngest siblings pretty much 24/7. I guess you could say our family is kind of dysfunctional. Oh and weâre also homeschooled and I havenât done practically any substantive coursework in over two years now. Technically, I should graduate high school soon but I donât think I can show my mom anything to put in my portfolio. Honestly? I donât care. Iâm tired of everything. Iâm not passionate about any major or career path that Iâve looked into (Iâm not ready for college anyway lmao). Iâm  not remarkably talented at what I enjoy doing. Iâve had very few experiences because of my home-life. Iâm not attractive. Every instance where Iâve tried making something last with a boy has ended in disaster..... I just really donât want to be alive anymore. But at the same time I know for a fact that there are a lot of people whoâd be pretty fucked up if I killed myself.... and I really donât want to add any more pain into the world. I especially donât want to burden my little brothers and sisters with that. But at the same time it would tear them apart a lot to see me give up on myself and throw my life away like I inevitably will. I just donât know which would hurt worse...."

"PLEASE read, I need advice quicklyI went home from college for the weekend and I checked my email on the family computer. My little sister (she's 16) left her google drive account open by accident- I was nosy and read some of her stuff. There's about seven pages of all the ways she could commit suicide. I've noticed she's lost a lot of weight, her grades dropped from A's to B's recently, and she stays in her room. 
Our mom was recently diagnosed with cancer, and my dad may be getting laid off soon. We have a lot on our plates, do you think I should try to get her a therapist or call a hospital? Or is this not a big deal? I have no idea how to respond. I can post more if requested. Heres some of it: 
The solid, smooth feel of the hand gun stowed in the coat is comforting, the heart races just a bit faster as I contemplate the meaning of existence yet again, to become a god! Complete, utter control over the thing I hold most sacred to my breast, the very notion of life! It makes life so precious, when one can fully accept that it can easily end in seconds. Precious is the sound of rains, the slender figures of trees in my peripheral visions, the scents of the grasses bending and flattening in the torrential pours. There is an inescapable beauty to feel the utmost control, the rawest power over your own realities.
I walk, without hurry, down the muddied paths of the nearby park to the farthest point from the flooded parking lot, surrounded by the beckoning trees, protecting, looming over me. I call 911 and whisper my location. ""I will pull the guns trigger in two minutes time, please clean my bloodied head as much as you can before returning it to my family."" I would turn the phone off, and watch it fall to the ground as if in slow motion, sinking in a mud puddle.Â 
I take off my jacket and fully embrace the rains, and the winds that were carried in gusts for miles. No longer would I be able to differentiate between the natural rains, and my flowing tears, just accept it, accept the entire world, the rains soaking through my very skins, accept life as an insubstantial, temporary form, the true beauties of nature and far off mysterious universes remaining. Lifting my arms far above my head, a hand cupped to caress the elements, the other clenching the gun, I would scream, my very soul allowing an overwelming torrent of the deepest emotions and energies, ""THIS, TRULY, IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE ALIVE! LIFE IS SO PRECIOUS."" Then I would pull the trigger next to my right temple, and sob as an immense echo of thunder rolls through my senses, my form gracefully falling to the ground.
Desperation and sudden violent urges often consume my mind, while sitting at my desk, bent over in frustration at the math homework. I often feel compelled to run downstairs, pull a plastic bag from the drawers near the back door, and retreat to the garage late at night. I would kneel on the cold cement floor, ignoring the long centipedes that scramble past frantically. Then I would begin to slam my head against the unforgiving floor, relishing the headache that quickly rings after, the solid feeling of all the circling thoughts disappearing at last. Slam, slam, over and over, til I see stars in the complete darkness, and feel the warmth of rushing blood collecting around my neck at the rubberband I had fastened beforehand, its metallic scent overpowering. I could collapse to the ground, and lose consciousness, the bag pulling in closer to my nostrils and half opened mouth with each deep breath
Staring at the student profile packet, in which I am supposed to write down all my achievements for the past three years, makes me most depressed- far more than I have ever felt. I try to avoid going out of my comfort zone, and have a lack of motivation for doing anything- even activities I used to enjoy. Everything is so overwhelming and tiring. This has been my daily reality for the past four years, no breaks. A long dark tunnel, with no escape, fingernails bloody from scratching at the curved walls- but there are no doors- nothing- just my panting and the ghostly laughters- just on and on- nothing-
Even the word 'feelings' causes a subconscious recoil, but I must admit- extreme feelings of guilt, insecurity, depression, worthlessness, and restlessness have plagued me. It's always there, always letting me know my efforts at writing and drawing are and always will be utterly futile. But now I am supposed to quantify this lethargy, and show it to the school, the world. People continue to ask what is wrong- I say nothing. I just want to be left alone! Left to my own devices! I don't want others to care for me, it makes the suicide that much worse! My parents look at me with such sadness- they are ashamed to have such an offspring, such laziness- squandering away all these opportunities to actually prove the potential I was born with. I deeply hate myself. Cutting no longer satisfies, because I know that eventually the knife will be put away, and I will have to deal with reality and myself yet again. If I hang myself next weekend during the night in the basement, no longer will people see me as a complete loser and idiot. My depression will be taken seriously, and my awful grades and motivation will be forgiven. Everyone dies eventually, and all that will remain is your name and the memories held by people who once knew you. With my current trajectory and depression, I will slowly fall to the bottom- impacting and burdening everyone around me. My name will be redeemed if I die now. Dragging it out is the last thing I want to do. My family will no longer feel ashamed by me, they can finally get on with their lives. I have fought for years- there is no hope. No hope. If someone else is reading this, and I am still alive- then perhaps I had enough hope to show you this- but trust what I say. There is no reason to even get better. I hate myself so deeply, the perfectionism is so consuming, I cannot process most foods from anxiety so everything must be restricted, I cannot force smiles for my parents and friends, my mind is numb and dull. My self control is wearing far too thin. Death seems like the only possible solution. What's the point of fighting for life if you eventually die? If you enjoy living, striving for goals, feeling proud of accomplishments and being in relationships, then perhaps life is for you. As for me, four years of fighting is far long enough. I'm ready to give up. It would be so easy and simple. Suicide ideations are becoming more and more pervasive. I cannot concentrate on reading novels once greatly enjoyed, nor can I listen to music. The clock is ticking, I am on borrowed time. I am so weak and unable to continue.Â .Â "
"Strangulation. Possibly addicted?I engage in self strangulation, usually by either wrapping cords, fabric or my own hands around my throat and keeping it there until I'm on the verge of passing out.
I will also hold my hands over my mouth and nose, causing myself to pass out.

While I am a year clean of self harm in the form of cutting, I've recently turned to this form of taking out my anger and stress.

I think I've become addicted to it. At random points, during homework, watching YouTube, eating, etc. I'll just pause and try to suffocate myself.

What should I do?

I do not have access to a help group or therapist."
"So apparently I gave someone over 10 awards on accident I was trying to check what awards I've given and received over my time in Reddit, and today, I decided to give someone an award, because, well, the person deserved it for a big accomplishment.

Anyway, I checked today what I've given, and it said I gave her 4 Silver awards and 7 community awards, with my 100 Reddit coins gone.

"I'm happy, but what difference does that make?I'm happy. I feel better than I've ever done before. I get help, I get proper medication and I feel satisfied with where I'm going in life. I have found meaning and purpose and joy in living! 

But really... what difference does it make? 

Last weekend something happened to me. I collapsed at a party and ended up at the hospital. The doctors think I got drugged. It was traumatic and horrible. I was scared and in pain, but most importantly I was so ashamed. I have a history of losing it when I get drunk and it is common knowledge that I really shouldn't be drinking. Yet here I was... at a party, drinking. Before this event i'd been sober for a few months and I know I shouldn't have gone out, but my friends convinced me and before I collapsed I actually had quite a good time. Now, this ""incident"" only convinced me even more to stay sober and to not drink, but I really can't stop blaming myself for what happened. They say I was drugged but it must have been my fault somehow. Mostly because that's what my friends keep telling me...

I live in a big apartment with two of my friends, both of them were present when I collapsed. Anyway, they have decided to kick me out. Because of what happened at that party. They don't want to be responsible for me when (not if, when) these things happen. They say it ruins their own happiness to constantly worry and take care of me. That I'm a time bomb and a risk. Dangerous and depressing. Now, as I mentioned at the very beginning I am in a really good place in my life so I didn't really understand what they were saying. They don't need to worry. What happened was an accident (right? maybe it wasn't?) and I will not drink again, I don't want to! But they do not believe me. They say they believe that I WANT to stop drinking and get better, but that I won't be able to. 

Just a few months ago I was a total mess. I was unemployed, I had no money, I lived isolated and alone, I couldn't afford food so I only ate 2-3 times/week, I partied all the time, did drugs and frequently hurt myself and others. Then I did what everyone expected me to do, I tried to kill myself. Obviously I didn't succeed and I ended up at the hospital instead. That's when I decided to turn my life around and start living. And I did! I decided to move back home to the countryside, I stopped drinking, got proper psychiatric help and a diagnosis (BPD). I started taking care of myself and applied for classes at the university. All of a sudden I could see myself living a long, happy life. 

Anyway... I came back to the city to study. (So far I love it. Very happy about it) Moved into this great apartment with my friends. Went to one (one!) party, things went to hell and now apparently I am too. 

To get to the point: I'm now homeless (again) and have nowhere to go. I feel as if I will never be able to outrun my former mistakes. No matter what I do, no matter how good I might feel, I will always be seen as a disaster and a problem. Right now nothing makes any sense and absolutely everything feels hopeless and meaningless, despite the fact that I'm happy and on the right track in life. It feels like I can't do anything right. Like I will forever be judged by who I once was. I really don't think I can handle getting torn down and having to build myself up one more time. It feels like I've done it a billion times already. I'm just so tired... I really don't see the point in fighting for myself again when it obviously doesn't really make a difference. I think about killing myself and it feels okay. It feels like the only reasonable thing to do. It is what everyone expects anyway, and they're probably right... it doesn't matter what I do or who I become, I should just go ahead and end it already. I am 19 years old and I have already ruined everything. I ruin everything for everyone. I'm a problem and a burden and I must die. I must die so everyone I ever knew can be happy. I must disappear and vanish and go away. I can't make any sound, I can't be seen, I am disgusting and a disgrace. Death is the only thing for me. I have to kill myself. I have to I have to. I can see it in everyone's eyes, that they want me gone. I feel so sorry for ever taking up all this space and wasting all this time. I feel so sorry and I feel so dirty and I feel so heavy. Please please please let me die this time.

"Hi allAnyone wanna talk? I'm feeling suicidal and just need someone to chat too.

No worries if not.

Thanks in advance guys and girl!"
"16 male. I am completely lost in life and am considering just ending it all to get rid of this stress.I apologize for how self entitled and ignorant I probably am going to come off in the post but honestly if just one person reads this or responds with advice ill feel better because I feel so lost i have no idea what to do.

I guess ill give a brief summary on who I am since it has to do with what has lead me here. I'm 16 and I have a really odd dream/life goal. Ever since I was 4 I have wanted to be a youtuber. Its a passion that gets me out of bed in the morning. I don't have a channel because of a lot of depression and anxiety hitting me and just not feeling the motivation to start and the fear of failing again. 

When I was around 7 or 8 I made a channel where I attempted to tell stories through playing with my toys and giving them voices and such. I didn't have any friends and I just really wanted to make something. Never thought it would go anywhere but low and behold that channel and that series now sit at over a million views. One of the episodes alone has nearly 500K. It was stupid and I cringe thinking about those videos now but at the time the success the results the views (and yes the adsense income) made me happier than I had ever been in my life. Nothing else ever compared to it. I grew up in a foreign country as an American and was never good at socializing and it was like finally I found some way to make people laugh and smile without me having to be in a group. And to this day nothing makes me happier than the idea of recapturing that fame. I ended the series as I grew out of toys and lived in a fear that as the series would grow someone would discover I was doing this despite hitting the age where toys weren't cool. 

So I wrapped it up and told myself I was going to make another channel and start again. Ive made videos here and there since but never really started a channel to do anything consistently.  For a while I tried to convince myself to seek another passion but really the idea of doing anything other than Youtube just hurt. Its all that excites me. Its all that I can really picture myself happily doing as a job. I know its unlikely and so many people fail at it but I want it so bad. Its like nothing else matters. 

The reason I never started another channel I guess was just because life got in the way. I got bullied a lot and developed an eating disorder and went to rehab I met a girl and she sexually assaulted and cheated on me and just as I was recently trying to get comfortable with myself and figure out who im going to be on Youtube (its a lot harder to find yourself than be a bunch of toy characters) I saw this youtuber who 

Looks like me 
Has my name
Plays the same instrument as me
And is basically the same person on a humor level

And hes successful. Really successful. He had everything I want out of life and I don't even know why its hitting me so hard but the fact that hes so similar just made me have a fucking huge anger attack and smash up my room. 

I just can't take it all. Its like everything unique I had to offer was just gone. He does the same stuff I wanted to do and hes so similar to me its like if I try to make my channel now ill be called a ""ripoff"" or something and no one would even give me a second look because why would they watch me when they can watch him? I have nothing to offer anymore.

Its like just as I was getting confident I could do this and make my dream a reality I have nothing anymore. 

And its just hitting me so hard. Ive spent this past week in my room crying and screaming and I just have no idea what to do. Im 16. I wanted to start a channel and support myself so I could get out of my parents house asap but the market has been cornered on myself. I have no idea what to do anymore and I have really been considering just finding a way to get to sleep and not wake up so all this stress of becoming someone will just be lifted. 

I don't know what to do. Its like my personality was stolen. Im no one now. No one will ever be interested in me. Im just a knock off version of someone else now. And no other dream or notion makes me even remotely excited to be alive.

I may add more later but I don't know what to do im going to go nap again.. I don't know what to do.. "

"Question about Demisexuality Hi, I suspect that I may be Demisexual/Demiromantic but I'm kinda confused.



From what I heard, being Demi is not being able to feel physically and/or romantically attracted to someone without forming a bond first?



The only crush I've had is someone I've known my entire life and I've liked him for over a year. I can acknowledge that someone is attractive or a good person but I would never date them or imagine kissing them until I got to know them. I couldn't even imagine kissing my crush during the first month or two that I liked him



What do you guys think?"
"Ay yo I need peeps who are straight vibin through life I want the peeps who have an idea but not a plan or parts of a plan. I want the peeps who think up something and then decide to try it. The peeps who dont have any major cares or like 1 or 2 major cares. Cause ik I cant be the only one, so if you're straight vibin like me DM me. I might make a gc on reddit, snap, or discord or something."
"If i don't die, it's not seriousNo one takes me series since young ages, when I was determined to die and kill myself, because of my upbringing. Now I'm 26, and cut my wrists, saying that i will kill myslef doesn't make difference.
the only way they will take me serious and get hurt its if I go through it.
I have told them I would kill myself many times, I have tries through the years, but no one care. They ""save"" me from it, and no even a word from my parents I heard.

I thibk my main reason its to die, so they can learn 

And also so the pain on me go way. I can take anymore living all the time with the pain. I don't want to try or cry or do a new treatment, I just want the noise and the pain to go away. And if this means, as a plus, that i will hurt them, so be it"

I have liked someone

I had sex

I have done interesting shit

I have dated

I have cuddled

Have kissed

And I have done many more things I don't know what to include

"Just some last ramblings from a ghost.Well I've set a date and picked a method. I've even got a plan on how my body will be found. I've ghosted everyone in my life in preparation it's been a few weeks now since then.

It's funny when I ghosted out I held a false hope that some one would attempt to contact me but I knew deep down that I was lying to myself. I've lived my whole life as a tool for others to use no personality or anything I was just what ever someone wanted me to be. 

I got so sick of being used as a wallet by someone that I cut them out of my life. Biggest mistake ever tools don't have thoughts or feelings and as a result I was abandoned by everyone else. They said I was rude and that I shouldn't of removed that friend from my life. 

The last two people I had who I really connected with are sick of me even though they care they can't deal with their own issues and help me. I hope they don't feel any guilt I've made it as hard as I can for them to not hear any news it's better this way. I care for them a lot honestly they where the first people to show me that I'm human. 

A few days from now I won't exist but that's ok with me I've accepted my fate it's one I have picked and lead myself too. "

"Is it moral to commit suicide if your loved ones want you gone?I have a panic disorder/agoraphobia, and it prevents me from doing a lot of things. I was blatantly told by my mother (whom I live with) that she canât handle me anymore. I donât blame her, I have no job and have issues just leaving my room. I want her to be able to live her life without having me as an obstacle, and she wants the same. She tells me often that she canât stand who Iâve become, and that she wishes she had someone else for a daughter. I think my brother would be hurt hardest by my death, but everyone else would get along okay.

Is it wrong to kill myself when I know some people will be hurt? Wouldnât it be just as wrong to live and hurt people too?

For the record, Iâve been in therapy and am on medication. I really want to change and be better, but I donât know how. Suicide genuinely seems like the only fix. "
Life feels like a ton of work with very little payoff.I'm only 16 and I already feel done. There's just no point anyway. I used to think I was depressed because I just sat at home all day. Now that I'm actually doing things life just seems like having to do a bunch of shit I don't want to do and never getting what I really want. I don't think it matters what I do. I almost never feel happy because I'm so depressed and have such a bad attitude and I'm too lazy and unmotivated to even do anything about it.
"The suicide hotline is a jokeI waited for over an hour for the texting portion. After it said it connected me, there was no response. The hotline is busy now. I was disconnected 3 times.

"Just remembered this from last year felt like I should mention So for some context I go to an all boys school and we had a female substitute teacher, we were in science class and humans we brought up and we were referred to as homo Sapiens so as a class full of boys would do they made homo jokes because HaHAaHa no homo = comedy obviously. The class was making jokes for like 5 minutes and all of a sudden of sub just went crazy at 1st we were confused why but then we noticed what she was saying, so it turned out she was lesbian and we were just insulting her for must of felt like hours to her. Now Iâve learned my lesson and homo does not equal funny and to respect other peopleâs choices on their sexuality. 
To the 5 of you that read that, I hope you respect other peopleâs sexuality."
"I've thought about it.Im young, 14 years old and I feel like life already hates me. Im asian, and of course my parents want me to ""be the best"" and ""get straight A's"" but i don't care about that. I want to enjoy my life, follow my passion (animation) and hang out with mu friends. Life wasn't the best but then it happened. On the last day of Thanksgiving break, my mom pulled me over and told me my Dad was doing drugs. To some people this might not be much, but in the place i live in, smoking is uncommon. When I was told this, it hit me like a bullet. I didn't know how to feel but my mom just said ""we need to encourage him to get out of the bad habit"". This went on for about 2 months before my dad said something - he wanted a divorce. Later we found him doing drugs in our house and my mom kicked him out. I really don't know what to think. On top of this shit i get bullied at school. Every day someone flips my lock, and people call me a faggot. I don't know what to do, what to think. I've considered suicide but I just don't know. Please. Help me."

"I was released from a mental hospital yesterday and Iâm planning on killing myself tonightI was admitted to a mental hospital  for being suicidal. Every day when I was getting my medication, they asked me, âAre you having any thoughts of hurting yourself or anyone else?â I always answered no, because I wanted to get out sooner. I was lying.

Iâm transgender. Millions, if not billions of people hate me by default and would rather I were dead. All Iâve ever wanted is to be a man. No matter how many hormone injections or surgeries I get, Iâll never look quite like a biological man. (Furthermore, I canât even get on HRT,  the one thing that might make me feel a little better, because Iâm a minor and my parents are unsupportive.) My body has been disfigured by female puberty and thereâs no going back now. No one in my life sees me as a man. If they call me one, itâs because theyâre trying to be polite. My mother has made it clear I will always be her little girl; she loves the version of me sheâs made up in her head.

My friends didnât care that I was in the hospital. They werenât worried and they didnât miss me. Life went on without me. Life will go on without me after tonight. I have not felt true happiness in 4 years and I donât expect to anytime soon. I have no reason to live.

I donât know why Iâm posting this. I guess I just want somebody to finally listen. My friends donât take me seriously when I say Iâm suicidal. I have no idea what to do. I just want the pain to end."

"Found friend's diary entry about me.Firstly, I thought it was a sketch book, as she's a talented artist.  She's been my friend since we were around 9, and we live together now.

I know everyone complains about everyone else at some point, but my brain isn't listening.  My arms are throbbing for my craft knife, and it's terrifying me.  

My sense of humor is bullying people.  I didn't realize that it was still bullying people.  I want to undo everything I ever said and I'm so overcome with guilt and embarrassment, I reached out and apologized to the people she mentioned on messenger, but I want to delete my facebook now.  I don't want to exist.  I want to die.  She said that no one is attracted to me because I seem aggressive and insane.  I'm so sorry.  I can't tell her I read something so personal, but I also don't want to see her.  

I'm just going to take the sleeping pills I have left and hope i don't wake up again.  No one needs another insane, angry person on this planet.  I can't believe I've been so blind.

"I wish I was born a girl insteadI don't want to transition. I have no desire to become a woman in this life. I just wish I was born a girl instead. A girl with beautiful white skin, which I don't have, and soft brown hair, which I don't have. Not the abomination I am now.

My life would be so much better and I'd be so much happier. I hate how I look now and I can hardly be around people. I don't look anyone in the eye when they talk to me anymore because I hate who I am and what I look like. I wish I had long hair and wore girl's clothes. And don't tell me I can still do these things as a male, it's not the same and that's not what I want. I don't want to be seen as a man. I wish people would look at me and think I'm pretty, not handsome (though I'm not that either).

I also wish I was white or just had lighter skin. I hate being dark-skinned. I would be alright with not being female if I was a least white. I am pretty much the opposite of what I want to look like, and ugly dark skinned male, and there's no way to change it. I've given up on my body and I don't take care of myself anymore. I spend so many hours in my head pretending to be a pretty girl. I have an image of myself as a girl and I spend most of my waking hours as her. I don't look in mirrors anymore because I don't want to be reminded of what I really look like. I avoid contact with people because I don't want to be reminded of how people see me now. My life was already bad before these thoughts started and now it's broken beyond repair."

"Life is so long yet so shortI sit here everyday trying to comprehend my own life. Remembering past memories of my life. Thinking of my current situation. 5 years ago seems like nothing but a lot of things have changed but it also feels like forever many things seem the same. I seem incapable of being happy with my life and I always wonder where exactly I made the wrong choices or if those choices were wrong and if my life is better or worse from them. Life is so meaningless yet the most meaningful thing. I'm sick of these contradictions and grey areas in life. I just want a clear set path to find happiness. Was my problem never finding a good hobby in my youth? Was my problem not pursuing the hobbies I already had for a career path? Was my problem my inability to connect with anyone I talk to? Was my problem that I locked off my emotions and am barely even human anymore? So many different paths could place me at so many different areas of life. I just wish I know what happiness is or at least how to start finding my own. It just feels like I was destined for misery. That I will never have a chance of happiness or connection with others. I will just suffer until I can't stand it any longer. I really just want someone that I can rely on and be there for me. I feel like I'm always there for my ""friend"" but she couldn't care less about me. Even if I do truly connect with someone I know our paths will split eventually and I just can't mentally take that. So in the end no matter what I'll be alone, miserable and broken."

Miserable mainly, I'm incredibly lonely and yet I don't feel I can deal with people right now. I have no energy and at times I can barely make myself move. As I said, I can't find joy in anything and as a result all I want to do is sleep or drink.

I feel awful about all this because I have no real reason for it, I just wish I had something to aim these feelings of hopelessness at."

"Wanna kmsWas just trying to sign up for school and just the thought of it made me really feel like killing myself. But I could never do my parents like that. If my parents ever die then so,will I. I hate how toxic some people are. I have a deep hatred for humanity. It makes me not want to keep going. Thinking of how unfair life really is makes me want to give up. Life is like a fucked up game. What do you do when the games not fair. You fucking quit playing. People are so self absorbed in their own realities they dont give a fuck about anyone but themselves and lack the brain power to put themselves in other peoples perspective and they dont give a single fuck how their actions appear to you or affect u. I hate my self a lot I cant get over it. I have always had problems feeling affection towarda others and not having those feelings returned and I cant take it much more before I really do kill myself in the heat of the moment one day. I was diagnosed a communication disorder and I want to not believe it but there are some days where things happen that make me think its true after all. I'm not afraid of death but I'm afraid of the immense pain that comes before it. I don't believe I will go to hell or heaven.

"UglyThis species is fucking terrible. I wish we would get hit by a meteor, or global warming ends us, or nuclear war.

We deserve it. What is the point of being alive if you're ugly?  To get gossiped about in public?  To have people gawk at you and laugh at you but not talk to you?  To make sure you never feel any pleasure or joy unless you pay for it? WHY ARE PEOPLE SO BASE?

The older I get the more I hate people and the less I want to go outside or interact with anyone. What's the point? The point is to be born good looking or have a perfect personality or you are nothing, apparently. No suggestions ever helped. Self-improvement is a dead-end and doesn't change what matters -- your base looks. I don't understand. Where is the humanity? Where is this thing called love? It seems to fall into place with attractive people ALL THE FUCKING TIME.

So this is it?  It's about being ugly and that's your life, you get old and die, and everything you do is without reward or pleasure because pleasure is for beautiful people even if they can't properly speak. This is the world around me. Where is the world others talk about? Where are the non-superficial people?  People say they exist, where are they. WHERE ARE THEY?!?!

It makes me sad because you can't talk about this with anyone. My family will wonder why even though I begged for help for years on end. No one ever helped, no one introduced me to anyone, no one gave anything but backhanded platitudes. Is it really looks? I know when I cover most of my body perfectly in nice clothing people are nicer, but only when I wear many layers. When they see what I am they don't care.

I don't understand and am panicking.  Where do people meet REAL FRIENDLY NONSUPERFICIAL PEOPLE or is LOVE now only for the beautiful? I don't understand and the more people say this isn't the case, the harder it is to exist in a world where it clearly is.

WHAT THE FUCK? The longer I am alive, the more time I spend around people, the more I hate them. How could you ever not hate something so superficial and base?  THIS was what we evolved to be?  The fuck. So is the only justice dismantling everything like the Koch brothers, because people don't deserve it because they're ANIMALS WHO CHOOSE TO ACT EVEN MORE ANIMALISTIC BECAUSE IT FEELS GOOD?

I can't spend time outside anymore and I hate people. All I ever wanted was an explanation. Are people really THAT base and LIE about it THAT MUCH?  I think suicide by cop is probably easiest. What do you think?"
"Ramen noodles life hack If youâre ever making Ramen noodles itâs almost necessary that you drain 95% to 100% of the water after boiling the noodles and before you put the seasoning in. It improves the taste of the noodles by 200% since the flavoring doesnât just go to the water, making the noodles taste almost like nothing."
Life.I'm incompatible with any other person. I don't want a life where no one cares about me. I will never get to have friends. I have no interests to share. I'm not interesting. I should be dead. Soon.

"Is wanting to commit suicide attention seeking?I get depressed quite a bit. To the point I feel like ending my life a lot. I was talking to someone today and they suggested that it is seeking attention. 

I don't think I can agree with this statement. Why would one want to seek attention with suicide it is beyond me :(. Anyone?"
"[24F] âQUARTERâ LIFE CRISIS ??? Idk I just know, that I canât.HELLO, Iâm guessing this is a subreddit where we get to share our deepest emotions &amp; weâll all look out for one another, right! Ok so here it goes.

So I really do believe Iâm in some sort of crisis right now. With NO WHERE TO TURN, NO ESCAPE OUTLET. First of all, My 60 year old dad has a girlfriend that is my older sisterâs age , 29. So thereâs the first MINDFUCK, yeah how the fuck am I supposed to view my dad the way dadâs are supposed to be viewed? It makes me sad sometimes but generally angry, but heâs making these active choices &amp; saying âhave a nice lifeâ with his actions to the family he made with my mom. So heâs still legally fucking married... and he asked me if I could help him file for divorce from my own mother. #1 DAD. But anyways, moving on. 

My mom ... EVERY FUCKING DAY WOULD TELL ME TO STOP WASTING MY TIME, GO TO SCHOOL , GO TO SCHOOL , GO TO SCHOOL. So I can pick up the pieces where my dad left us off at!!! Thatâs all she wants mainly. MONEY. She also makes no sense. I got offered to train for a manager position at my current workplace , I told her about it and she CHUCKED IT OUT THE WINDOW so fast JUST BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL LOCATION OF WHERE I WOULD WORK. I said I could come home on weekends and she was like âyou wanna be on your own now?â WHEN THE FUCK CAN I BE ON MY OWN?????? DO I HAVE TO GET MARRIED???? 

MY SISTER IS A BITCH. Straight up using me and my mom so that her and her boyfriend can live together. Making my mom pay majority of the rent. My sister ALWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYS says sheâs broke but goes out to buy ALCOHOL EVERYWEEKEND. So my mom and I live with her and her boyfriend, I fought my mom so hard for me to not move in. Like let me live somewhere else. But she fuckin wonât let me :) and I listen because I donât want to regret it later on in life when I miss her down the road. So thereâs that. 

Iâm paying rent with them but I sleep over my boyfriends house and my mom doesnât know but Iâm her mind Iâm at my friends house and APPARENTLY SHES FUCKIN FINE WITH THAT BUT NOT A WHOLE NOTHER CITY. 


SO CURRENTLY.
Iâm with my boyfriend in his moms house mainly. His mom is a fucking hoarder. The whole bitchass HOUSE IS A FUCKING STORAGE!!!! 3 cars in the driveway that dont fucking work. 4 STORAGES IN THE BACKYARD OF THINGS SHES NOT GONNA NEED IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS. 
But, I got no say. So whatever. 


CHURCH.
I havenât gone to church in months.
Theyâre a cliquey bunch . When I first got in , in 2018. This girl was all over me just because I sat across from her fucking crush ONE TIME , sheâs gonna be passive aggressive when talking to me. Now sheâs all goody two shoes cause they ended up getting engaged. DING DING, I never wanted your dude in the first place. 

They also say to be content being single but are HELLA EXTRA during social interactions , trying to get this guy to this girl. Trying to stop this guy from talking to this girl. &amp; I let them do it. I had a crush, and that same girl got started asking me about it cause she knew her friend likes him. He was messaging me, sitting at my table whenever there was a potluck. But it never was really straightforward and OMG Iâve got to add he made me really nervous because of how much I thought he was amazing, cute, just everything I ever wanted. Well when I stopped going to church... on my life , heâs made multiple attempts to try to get me back to church... but MY EATING DISORDER wonât let me. &amp; so the girls friend and him well, they recently got married. 

It does hurt me. I donât know why . But it does, he was always in the back of my mind since I got to the church... I was soooo sure we would workout somehow but now. Yeah.

My boyfriend tends to me. He does everything I want him to. He addresses my concerns. HES SHORTER THAN ME BY THE WAY. BOOOOOOY does he need to GROW UP. He plays video games 24/7 and has a tax business that his mom gave him from his grandpa. (But his mom mainly does the clients) 
I would test him sometimes. I would open the door for him. He would walk through. Idk itâs a long ass list.


&amp; YEAH I HAVE NO OUTLETS. I HEARD SOMEWHERE THATS WHY PEOPLE COMMIT SUICIDE BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER HAVE AN OUTLET TO EXPRESS THESE EMOTIONS. NOTHING TO FALL BACK ON. 
&amp; I FEEL LIKE IM ON THE VERGE THERE. 

So fuck this life , tnx for reading I guess."

"I didn't realize this was a subreddit. Here is what I have been writing. I started free writing about a week ago. I get so upset that I just start typing whatever comes into my head. I have felt this way since I got back from Iraq a few years ago. However about six months ago it has gotten out of control. I have had bouts or incidents of PTSD since returning home but I always bounced back. I thought I could deal with it and it would get better over time. It seemed like it was working at first. I was pretty out of control when I first got out. After several months I started to calm down though. Some time over the summer it hit me and I have not bounced back yet if that makes sense. It has been constant ever since then. I have never dealt with anything like this before. I feel like I am loosing my mind. Last semester at school was the worst I have ever done out of three years at school. I can't concentrate I can't remember things. I have gained weight and i can't find the motivation to do anything. Is this the right subreddit for this or is there a more appropriate one? I am not thinking about killing myself but a lot of times I do wish I was dead. A lot of behavior is certainly self destructive. Also I contacted the VA back in September telling them I needed to talk to someone and I am still waiting to see someone. They keep pushing my appointment back. The next date I have isn't until March. In the meantime I don't know what to do. I don't have insurance outside the VA or money to pay for a civilian shrink. Anyway here is what I have been writing.

I left my mind back in the desert and I am having a hard time dealing with the real world. I canât deal with people and everyday life. I walk through work like a zombie. I am on auto pilot and my mind is back in the desert.

I struggle with the urge to drop out of society. To just not take part in the whole thing anymore. To just exist somewhere as a living creature. Not a human in the rat race.

Everything I have know up until several months ago is obsolete. I donât know anything. I canât relate to anyone. I donât know whether I am going to scream, explode, hit someone, break down into tears or just sit there and stare the wall.

I donât know what to do anymore. I think I would be happier if I just lived in the woods away from people. If I just drifted from town to town trying to get by, day by day. At least it would be different and exciting. I feel like the monotony of everyday life is going to make me lose it. If there is anything left to lose. The day in day out of going to a job that I canât stand so most of it can go to pay for a mortgage.

New day

I sit and I stare at the wall. My eyes are filling up with tears. No specific reason why. I am questioning my entire existence. I donât want to do any of the tedious bullshit anymore that makes up everyday life in society. I am ready to smash something or tare something apart.

I think back to the last time I saw *****âs father alive. He was sick with cancer and we knew he was going to die. This was my last time home a few weeks before I would leave for Iraq. I remember sitting in the room with him thinking that soon we would both die. I remember sitting there thinking at least he had lived a full life and could die with his family around him. I would go die alone in a desert at 21. I didnât die however. I came back. Although I feel dead inside. I donât feel any connection to anyone. I feel distant to everyone and everything. Sometimes I feel like I am watching myself move about throughout the day.

"I'm looking for artists and song that are not about romance and that stuff This is probably not the best subreddit to post but I got tired of the same topic on music over and over again. I listen to rock music too, which is used by the artist to say other kind if interesting things and not just that they had a lover. So, if you could recommend an artist or even a playlist on Spotify, I'd be grateful.
Sorry if i use any word incorrectly, I'm not a native English speaker."

"I miss my crush... I have liked her for over a year now. We've talked and become good friends, and I told her my feelings. But through manipulation and avoiding me, she has made it clear that she doesn't like me. We left off on a bad note, and I have wanted to text her for so long. I'm trying to forget her, but it's so hard.

I have constant dreams about her, the memory I have of her pops into my head every few hours. It fucking sucks, dude. I just want to talk to her, but I know it's a bad idea."
"I'll never amount to anything. Nobody will remember me for long.I look at all these famous people who have done such incredible things and then I look back at myself. I'm ugly, stupid, incompetent....unable to come even close to them. I'll never do anything worth remembering. So what's the point in living? When you die all that's left is the things you did, so if you never did anything important then what's the fucking point. Might as well die now since I know for a fact I'll never do anything important."
"Can you hire someone to visit your animals?They'll be fine if/when I kill myself. My dogs live with my father, and my parrot's going to a sanctuary not too far from my house. I just want to make sure people will be play with them, love them. etc.

"I wish i wouldve died in my car accidentI dont feel like acting upon my suicidal thoughts, i just always have them. They get pretty bad at times, down to where it will happen, how, what time, etc. I believe i have bipolar disorder, but my psychiatrist does not think i do. I go through phases where i am extremely depressed, and phases where i want to do everything and try everything and sign up for classes and paint and record music and more and more. In my bad phases, i get angry and beat my face and head with my fists, i dont cut anymore, but i have gotten back to beating myself up, and i have made several painful bumps on my head. 

When i am depressed, i vape extremely heavily. I quit doing it every day for a while, but on my bad days ill do it for hours. Ill get a little disposable vape and use 3 in a few hours. Even with the law change, i find sellers who are willing to sell to me (im 20) and i use my old stuff i had before the law change. I think its stupid and refuse to follow it. I dont believe the news headlines saying its bad for you. I dont believe something thats helped me so much can hurt you. I dont believe the hype. I also use kratom. Its an herbal tea that you can get in powder and capsules that affects your opiod receptors. It turns them on similar to prescription painkillers, though not as strong. Without kratom, i would already be gone. 

I dated a 31 year old man beginning when i was 15 years old. He got me into sending pictures and videos to him. Im sure you know the sort. I was with him until i was nearly 20, when i moved back home from living with him. He doesnt believe what he did was wrong. We truly did love each other. But he destroyed me. Ever since i have gotten home from living with him, i have not been the same. I have thought of suicide more often. I have changed methods to more secure ones. When i was living with him, 6 hours away from home with no one besides him, i attempted suicide near him. He did nothing. He stared at me with a blank expression and screamed at me for misusing my medication. He didnt save me. I brought myself to the hospital. And then i left for home. 

I was depressed before i even met this man. I began feeling depressed at 12 years old and thought of suicide since 9. 

A few months ago, i was in a major car accident. I was tboned by a truck going 60 mph right on the drivers door. I broke my pelvis in multiple places and suffered a mild concussion. It felt like a curse. I was so close to death, and i didnt even make it. I often wish i would have died. I dont know why they bothered saving someone so hopeless. Im now 20 thousand dollars in debt from the accident (it wad my fault) and have no way to pay it. I have constant pain in my pelvis. Ive neglected help because of the cost. 

I was in therapy and a group therapy. I quit because they were charging me thousands of dollars. Insurance refuses to cover treatment. I cant afford therapy. I tried making an appointment, and they told me insurance would not cover it. I believe the mental health field is nothing but a scam out to get your money.

I have very unusual opinions, just look at my reddit. Im an antinatalist, a nihilist, an athiest, and a true believer in the belief that life means nothing. Please dont preach jesus to me. I had a very traumatic past with religion. When voicing my opinions online i have been told to end my own life, that no one will love me, and that i am worthless. 

I feel like this will never end. Treatment is too expensive. I feel like i will have no choice but to end my life within the next few years. Im terrified of growing old. I dont want to die a slow, painful death. I WANT to die by my own hand, and thats what scares me. Sorry this is all over the place. I wish i could be more consistent with it, but thats just how it is."

"Why does life have to be so difficult?I have no motivation anymore, I feel so tired all the time, I have a goddamn short term memory that Iâve suffered from all my life, every obstacle I face feels so unclimbable and if itâs not and I fail that only shows how incompetent I am and just keeps on adding to my list of failures. The only thing I accomplished is a high school degree. I canât do this not only can I not get a job or go back to school Iâm just not cut out to live. It would be so much better I would finally feel free if I could just stab myself in the brain. Or just die in general that would be so much better Iâd finally be freeâ¦"
"This is a test Please, downvote this to hell, for it is thy test."
"Thereâs always hopeThis is my story. Iâm a 15 year old girl and Iâm a freshmen in high school. My parents are great but they were pretty disconnected from my feelings. My older brother is 20 and moved to California, I live in NY. He didnât know I had depression and he didnât  know I wanted to die. I didnât  want him to worry about me, it feels like when people find out I have depression their whole mood shifts. They start to baby me and ask if Iâm ok, it would honestly help if they just treated me like a normal human. 

At school Iâm known as the quiet weird kid who sits in the back. I was always depressed ever since 5th grade. I loved art and I was even asked by my school to paint a mural on one of the back walls. I took me probably 2 month to finish it. I was so proud, It was a big eagle (thatâs our school mascot thing). A week later I told one of my âfriendsâ that I was gay and had depression. She then went on to tell the school about it. A few days later I walked into school and in the corner of my eye I saw that in big black spray paint someone wrote âsad fagâ right over my mural. Thatâs when I gave up. I had no friends, I gave up on art, I was bullied, and thought about killing myself. I looked at myself in the mirror while holding a bottle of pills. I couldnât do it I started crying. 

Itâs been 2 months since that happened and things are looking up. I met a girl called Maddy and sheâs helped me a lot. Sheâs also gay and struggled with depression. Sheâs told me about her problems and how she coped with it. I still get sad. Now I call her and she helps me through it. I also came out to my family and theyâre very supportive. My brother even came to visit for my birthday and we bonded a lot. My family also knows about my depression now and they help me a lot. I never thought Iâd say this but Iâm actually pretty happy.

I also work for my schools suicide hotline and help younger kids. I share my story with them and just be their to listen to them. I look back at how sad I was and think about what wouldâve happened if I took those pills. All I can say is Iâm glad I didnât."

"I guess I needed somewhere to go.Hi, I've never posted here before. But I guess I've never been as bad or as close to the edge as I feel right now and it's shitty and I hate myself and pretty much everyone around me. And I just feel so broken because this year has been a God damn nightmare. I've spent the better parts of six months experiencing sexual harassment from a co-worker from a place of previous employment. My significant other, who I thought was my soul mate, left me due to the people who sexually harassed me telling him I was having an affair, going so far as to doctor text messages and Facebook messages, even though I was faithful. For a month I have pushed through because I was graduating college and I thought things would pick up and I'd be happy. Even though I've cried myself to sleep for a month. This week I have done nothing but lay on my couch and cry while watching Netflix. I haven't eaten, or showered, or even brushed my teeth all that often. I should be packing things up to move into a new apartment and I can't even find the energy to move from my couch. I'm just... I'm so tired. I just want to eternally sleep and never wake up. I feel like I've lost so much. Friends who were originally supposed to be on my side, someone who was supposed to love me and would rather believe a rumor, family members who won't talk to me. I'm just ready to never wake up again. A part of me hopes that ghosts exist so I can come back and see how things are when they realize that they're all terrible fucking people to hurt someone so much that they're ready to stand in the middle of the highway. I just wish I had somewhere to turn without someone telling me I'm being over dramatic or stupid or anything else that means that they aren't listening. I guess that's why I'm here after all. Just to get out some thoughts."
You can't self-diagnose depression So please either stop or see a professional
"Tried to buy razors [Vent]I just tried to buy razors with the intent of slitting my wrists some time this month, forgetting that you have to have be 18+ to do so. I have non at home that would be even remotely sharp enough. So now I'm sitting outside the store feeling like an idiot having failed an attempt before even attempting. If I can't even fucking do that right then how can I expect myself do to anything else right."
"Damn bro so my genetics pretty much make me the whitest of white that ever whites the white So i have grey eyes, which I just found out, with a bit of blue. My ethnic background is from Norway, and I have blonde hair to top it off. My doctor told me pretty much that I could probably never get a solid tan. I have so little melanin that my skin turns a near dark red when I get cold."
"I feel like I have no really special friends, but there is a person I would do anything to become friends with. I will kill myself if I will forever fail trying to befriend this person.I am a 17 year old guy. While I have friends, they never ask me if I want to hang out. It's always me asking them if they want to hang out, but I guess it's better than not having anyone to ask. I also have a cousin (who matters the most to me out of anyone) who is almost 21, and she is a lot more different compared to my friends. I like her more than all of my friends, but the problem for me, is that I think she hates me and wants me to die. I want to become her friend, but I have no idÃ©a on how to befriend her. Whenever I see her I always get incredibly nervous for a few minutes, like I'm shaking a lot, because I don't want to fuck up by saying something wrong. Whenever I am with my cousin I usually always think twice before I say something to her, which I never do when I'm talking to my friends. 

My cousin is incredibly special, she is a sweet, intelligent and ambitious person. She is also a fantastic football player in my opinion, I've even seen her play with her team during a match. She also treats me super nicely. Like, whenever I am with her, she offers me a glass of soda. I also love listening to her voice, it's like no one else's. It feels like a real honor to meet her. 

I feel like my cousin is so special that if she never wants to be my friend, I want to kill myself. I've bought two tickets (130$ each) to a music festival I want to go with her to, and if she says no, I will cry and hurt myself. I don't know if this would count as manipulation or not, as my cousin should be smart enough to do what she wants. I also don't know if I should ask her if she could shoot me if I fuck up during the suicide attempt.

So I'm also basically asking on advice on how I can become her friend. I'm very sure there must be a way. I'll buy her a gift worth up to 60$ for her birthday, I hope that will make her feel like I might be worth something. I don't really care if she manipulates me by asking me  to buy her stuff.

"I think today is the dayI'm just here waiting for my parents to go to sleep. So I can cut myself, I feel so hopeless, nor my mother nor my father was supoortive towards me. My psyciatrist and psycologist are doing am excellent job but I'm just a lost case.

"Snap glitch? or did I do something wrong ðð Iâm talking to this girl and I was on delivered for like 17 hours so I clicked on her profile to see when she was last active and I accidentally clicked on our chat. I then exited out and it said that she opened my snap like 2s ago.... what do you think happened? I think the chances of me clicking on her profile and her opening my snap at the same time are really low so was snap glitching or what do you think happened?

"oooh people who slurp food are so annoying i have a close relative who does this (mind you, voluntarily) and FUCK it pisses me off so much. i think i might be either stupid or emotionally unstable. but God this is so annoying. this person manages to slurp everything, even solid food."

"I am mostly staying alive for my 13 yr old sister.The other day, she saw me in the sun, and told me I have freckles... well she thought they were. I just made a joke about it and said yea its those irish genes. Days later, I talked to her and told her that they were popped blood vessels in my face from when I asphyxiated myself the other day. She felt bad and is understand, she told me ""wow you need to leave"". I have mom and dad and 7 siblings, she is the youngest, and sometimes the most supportive and understanding, I really care about her, We all had a very rough past, but the youngest had it the least bad as the oldest (Me+older Sis) Kinda died for their sins and helped give them freedom we didnt have. I want her to succeed, my family is so dysfunctional I think she may be the only one that is completely salvageable at this point, but sadly she is showing some depressive symptoms. I feel like I have let all my siblings down, but I am very close with this one, and I will try my best to spread my knowledge to her and help her. "
"I hate who I am, how I behave with othersIt seems that I can not function well in the relationships with others, I believe I only create problems to others, and that I am a problem by myself. I asked my advisor to review a research project I wrote, but I felt like I violated his personal boundaries to get his help, indeed he politely refused, mentioning that he doesn't know the field. Maybe because he knows me, he knows that I am extremely sensitive to critiques, and if this project I wrote sucks, maybe he couldn't feel free to tell me the truth. I don't know how to behave properly with people, I just can let them down and I only want to disappear from the world"
"My family is probably the only reason why I havenât kms yetI need to vent this somewhere, I canât seem to find any other communities where this might fit into, and I sure as hell ainât gonna talk to my family about it

Iâm currently an RA in university and honestly I just donât see the point anymore. I thought I would want to be a teacher maybe but Iâve found the only thing that I like to do is play video games â itâs the only thing that gives me true enjoyment. I hate everything else- I donât like academics, I feel as if I died most of my friends wouldnât care they feel fake as fuck to me, I havenât had a single real relationship w a s/o my whole life, and I feel that ultimately everything wonât matter anyway because Iâm gonna die alone anyway. Oh and because WW3 is about to start. 

The only reason I havenât done anything drastic is because the only people that will miss me probably is my family. I have two moms, grandparents, and an aunt/two uncles that will miss me. I donât have any siblings. 

If I didnât have a supportive family, I almost certainly would be dead now. Every day gets harder and harder to keep pushing through. I donât know how much longer I can do this. 

If u read this, thanks, I just needed to post this somewhere and let my feelings out somehow"
"I need help, pleaseIdk what to do anymore, my girlfriend said she doesnât love me and hasnât for awhile and I donât make enough to live on my own with my daughter who I have full custody of and idk what to do. What happens to my daughter if I die? Even if I donât die itâs going to be hard on my daughter not seeing my girlfriend (whoâs not her mom btw) anymore. I donât know what else to say or what to do but Iâm probably going to kill myself this week"
"Mom beaten up by son's friend This happened like a year ago but it still bugs me... And I know I'm not a teenager but I'd like some kids perspective on it.

So my son is a big pro wrestling fan. Thatâs all well and good, but one night he had his friends over (also into this ""sport"" they see on tv) and they had some fun facing off against each other. This is also fine, but then someone came up with the brilliant idea that I should be their final opponent after their matches.

Everybody thought this was a great idea, cheering me on. Stupidly enough I agreed, thinking theyâre 11-12 and Iâm a grown woman, how hard can it be rightâ¦ Well it was HARD. I had my ass handed to me more times than I can count, these kids were freaking strong and one after another they kicked my ass! It was fun at first but... Eventually I had to tell them I was going easy on them because theyâre kids to save face, but I really wasnât. I doubt they believed me anyway. At least they had to go home eventually... How can they be so strong at this age?"
"Tell me how How can I forget other person, If you tell me solution to this problem im gonna give you my fingers."
I will never be able to find a girlfriend or go on a date. I'm going to kill myself.I can't see any way to learn basic human skills like: how to find people my own age. How to talk to girls. How to ask them on a date. I've realised I will be alone forever. I can't even get a job at a basic shop I am that pathetic. I have to kill myself. 
"Need someone to talk toSomething that scared me for life just happened.

"I want to kill myself, but I'm to scared to do itI'm not scared of dying, I'm just worried about my family and what they would do if I did. I've never attempted suicide, but I do cause self harm by scratching my skin until it starts to get red or even bleed. Or just hitting my head against the wall. My family life isn't bad now, except for the yelling. It's my emotions. My sadness has been overwhelming the past year and a half, and quarantine isn't helping. I've been taking depression meds, but they don't work. I've told my mom, but she said I seem fine. But, I've been acting fine around her, so I don't have to take any more medicine than I have to. Sorry for the life story, I just don't know what to do with my miserable life. I just want to die"
"I don't wanna be here anymoreThis is the first time in a long time I've contemplated suicide ""sober"", if you will. Typically my attempts are an impulsive action and I have to pick up the pieces afterwards.

I've been suicidal for as long as I can remember, its always been my escape route if things got too much, but this feeling at the moment is something quite different to all that. 

I just don't want to live. I am not happy, I do not make others happy, I have nothing positive to contribute and I just want to end it all. I am such a drain on others 

I'm currently following the advice of my old English teacher. I am making my plan, I am getting everything together for it, writing my notes, all of it. Then it goes on hold for three days, and if nothing in those three days makes me like sticking around then I guess im not sticking around. 

I always say you've survived 100% of your worst days but like I dont wanna keep living like that to be honest."
"Don't wanna be a statistic.41%. That is the number  that sticks with me, every time I look in the mirror. That is the number that makes me shake with fear, especially when my moods get like *this*.

Hi. My name is... unimportant. I am trans. I hate myself. I want it to end. I want to not see myself in the mirror. I want to not be around anymore. I want to stop being made fun of in this stupid town. I want it all to go away.

I was told to come here. Told people could help. 

Please help. I an feel the idea take root more and more every day. I don't want to be part of the 41% of people like me who attempt it. 

I wouldn't be lucky enough to make it."
Ive Been ThinkingIf only planning and envisioning living was as easy as envisioning death. I have 3 possible situations and am nearly shaping how I live around It until I can. Its constantly on my mind like background music
There's so many of my favourite anime coming out this year can't wait
"The days are stretching me thinThe longer the days wear on my mind will turn to suicide more and more often. My girlfriend can't help. I refuse to swallow pills from the Snakes in white coats. 

The prospect of death hasnt been this attractive in a long time.
And the holidays haven't even arrived yet. 

Suppose saying something about it will subconsciously influence the time i have left, leaving me with some sort of makeshift floation device that i can cling to while i wait for the emotions in the deep black waters of my mind to drag me to my bitter end."
"I promise Iâm okayHey fellas. First bit, Iâve been around here for a little bit and I know how nice and supportive you guys are. Makes me really feel like there are those that give a shit about us. 

Second bit, today was bad. Iâm hurt, confused, scared, angry and exhausted. Everyone here knows what thatâs like and Iâm truly sorry for that. I canât stop drinking, I canât stop crying, I canât stop being hurtful to everyone I meet cause Iâm an exposed nerve and that makes me just as bad as the people who hurt me. Itâs pains me to know how many wonderful, understanding people there are on this sub and know that Iâm not one of them. No matter how I try, I cannot be what was expected. I deserve this lot, I might even be ok with it. 

Third, I was taught every day of my life that education was the solution to everything and I believed it. I did the college thing, I even graduated to the horror of everyone Iâve ever met. But it didnât matter. It just got worse and I suspect it always will. Now, Iâve just got a lot of cute anecdotes to rattle off to my begrudging friends until they decide Iâm too annoying or batshit to keep around. Love the facade of friendship. 

I donât know. If I kill myself, I wonât get better, but if I live Iâll just get worse. Thanks for even giving this a moment of your undoubtably busy day. 

Thatâs more than most folks like us get huh?"

"Just some thoughts i had in my head So here we are i guess.

I will brainstorm some things that come into my mind, so i can relieve myself even if it's just a little bit.

I'll write whatever comes to mind, so these will be my general thoughts, warning: don't expect anything too happy.

I don't even know if i will post this lol, but i'll still keep this sort of like a diary.

So i basically got a low grade because I didn't do some homework, I don't want to talk aoubt the futility of some homework because you all know it,

but because of that low grade my parents of course yelled at me, it's been like this since i started high-school,so it's not like I didn't get adapted to it,

It's just that them(especially my mother), and my teachers, always tell us that we're lazy, that we have something wrong in ourselves for not doing things the

way they want to. And I'm like, yes, i agree that i'm lazy, but It's because I'm so tired after triying so hard to keep things together, not try and scream

every moment of every day, i'm tired of trying to not feel suicidal and not hoping to die in my sleep because i don't have the balls to kill myself,

I know i wouldn't kill myself, but i do not want to live in a world that treats me like this, but at the same time i don't want to die.

I don't want to die because i know that there are people that care about me, even my parents, but i don't know how to let them care about me,

I don't care and i'm afraid that i don't WANT them to care, even if in the end i really want that, i want help, ireally need help, but i can't get myself to 

ask for it, feeling that it might go wrong and send me down spiraling in an even worse case of my already destabilized and broken mental state.

This is not a suicide letter, I don't plan on killing myself don't worry.

But i hate living just because people need me, i don't want to live just because people in my life need me and they don't want me to die,

I WANT TO LIVE BECAUSE I WANT TO, not to grant some wish to someone that doesn't want me dead, i want to live on my own accord, but i'm afraid i can't do it.

One of the reasons i didn't tell my parents about how i feel, even if i wanted to tell tehm a lot, it's because my father(the one who treats me better out of

the two) saw me when i was in a really bad state, and told me if everything was okay and i finally decided to say no!

Yay!finally some progress after all this time, i wonder what could go wrong.

Well, he told me that it was because of a girl even if i told him it wasn't for it, i told that it was ""basically everything"", i wanted to at least let out

a minor part of what i'm feeling, and he tells ,me that the important is to remain happy and keep moving on.

Damn.

That thing didn't make me happier at all, at that point i was afraid to say anything to my parents because if my father reacted like this, my mother,

who always yells at me, for anything i do, uses me as her stress toy if she gets a bad day at work and she and my father tell me that

""when you have a kid you'll have the opportunity to do the same"", she always belittles me and gaslights me into thinking i'm wrong, and every decision i make 

can't be made without her telling me how bad of a decision i'm making.

I just feel so empty but at the same time filled up with nothing, it's a strange thing to describe, I can't cope with it.

And i didn't even talk about how i do have friends who i vent to, who understand me, but that doesn't stop me from thinking that i'm a burden to them,

that i'm not worth their time, how much i'm worthless, the neverending anxiety that comes out of me at ay point if i'm talking to someone or just sharing an opinion

or just thinking about future stuff that might happen.

As a kid i almost never dreamt of wacky and uncharacteristic stff, i always dreamt about dying, in a way or another, i was always dying, and now i'm not having

many dreams anymore, but i sometimes dream about dying too, about the topic of dreams, one time i had the best dream i ever had.

I don't quite remember what i was doing, but at some point it went all pitch black, I was completely blind, or well, dead.

I felt the need to breathe but i couldn't, no matter how hard i tried to breathe in, then i ran out of breath and one thought flashed into my mind.

""is this it? is it over?...finally""

It worries me that i thought ""finally"" even for a moment, but while i was saying that, i got to experience the thing that i'd describe as the most inner peace

that anyone could get, i was without worry, totally realxed, and i felt at peace with myself. 

Of course it was just a dream but it didn't stop me from remembering this peace and thinking about it, reminiscing how i'd love to feel it again.

I guess it's all for the currrent existential crisis, but at least I'm happy that i wrote about this, to get some thoughts out of my head.

I don't even know if i will post this anytime soon, but at least i'll be happy knowing that someone rad it if i posted that.

 I just want people to talk about what's happening in their lives, if this related to someone, let me tell you that it's not good

And with this i'll end this paragraph of what i wrote, maybe another time i'll decide to post something more serious like this other than memes but sure, maybe that time will come.

If i misspelt something i'll see if i can correct it, as i'm not a native english speaker, and i wish the best of luck to all of you, who are struggling with the same stuff as me.

I won't be able to reply to anyone since i'll be going to bed, but i'll see what i can do in the morning"

"Even though they know Iâm still ashamed and canât tell them moreSo Iâm 12 and male and have severe depression and anxiety, and Iâm suicidal. Both my Mom and Dad have depression yet I still find it hard to talk to them. They know I have it and I got to a therapist weekly but I donât know how to tell Iâve gone past hurting myself and am now considering suicide. When Iâm feeling good I wonât but when Im not it always comes to that. I miss school my anxiety gets so bad and only my best friend knows I have it so all my other friends ask me why I miss school and I find it socially awkward and it makes my anxiety worse.

I know you wanted the best for me life and I understand that but when it's time just know that I'll be at peace . I want you to be happy life and even if this supposable heat death comes then you can join me. I'll always be with you life and in the end I'm sure you have went to billions of years of suffering . I want your suffering to end to. To my soul, my mind, my body, you rest well and to me, let it be and let death take care of you. Trust it and be one with it. And last to my Mom don't be sad whenever I depart from this world. You did the best you could and I love you pookie always and forever â¤ï¸"
I guess she likes me now This girl that was relatively new to my school (only been there since September I believe) was talking to me about how she was thinking about bleaching her hair. But when she paused to let me speak I said âyour hair looks nice the way it isâ and she blushed and then we talked for a few more minutes during lunch. I think she liked me before this but I have a feeling that this amplified that.
I self sabotage everything good in my life and it's happened for the last time.Never mind. Just a case of getting fooled by a whore. To think I actually wanted to die over someone who would commit the ultimate betrayal. I feel oddly serene now. Time for bed. No more lack of sleep.

"Why do movies for little children have scenes like these in them?  

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GUuvkqvr9M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GUuvkqvr9M)

Like what the fuck? ""Haha, girl kicks boy in the balls so hard he collapses, girlpower! So funny how he crashes to the floor in agony and humiliation!""

How does the FETISHIZATION of this as ""girlpower"" NOT make it sexual violence and humiliation?

Why is this in movies for little children? Why are boys so worthless that this is portrayed as funny in movies for little children?  
Exploiting a boy's most vulnerable part, his genitals, his manhood, to extremely humiliate and hurt him as a male, at the hands of a girl.  
And this is fetishized as ""girlpower"". Why?  
When a girl does this to a boy irl, why should he NOT give her a hard punch in the fucking face for it once he can stand again?  
What the FUCK is wrong with girls who find this funny or awesome irl? How are they better than guys who laugh when girls get groped and put in that kind of agony?"
"Can't find a reason to live.I feel completely and utterly useless. I'm told I'm smart and have so much to offer, yet I can't specialize in any one thing. I constantly wonder what I want to do with my life and all I uncover is an empty feeling. It's as if I'm doomed to never do anything at all with what supposed smarts I've been given. I used to love to play sports and goof off with friends, but now I hardly talk to anyone. I thought I'd stick with my group of friends at least for a couple of years, but, like I said, I hardly talk to anyone anymore. No one likes me or even acknowledges me because they think I'm a self absorbed, conceited jerk because I'm always silent and have a reputation for skipping sixth grade. Maybe they're right, and I have absolutely no justification for feeling that way. But the thought of talking to them just rubs me the wrong way. My classmates are all interesting and skillful in one way or another, or at least popular due to looks, but I'm dull and useless. I quit sports last year, something I thought I might be good at but couldn't enjoy any longer, and I hardly ever use my gym membership because I can't bring myself to leave the house. I can't stand talking to my parents about anything either; it's always the same question, ""How was your day?"" At this point I always mumble something about a pointless assignment I did that brought no sense of accomplishment or interest that day just to get them off my back. I don't even enjoy the one thing that kept me going last year anymore- strategy video games like Advance Wars and Fire Emblem. I applied for a statewide academic program called Governor's Honors and made it to the final selection phase but I already know I failed because there's nothing interesting or unique enough about me to justify my attendance over the summer. I've never been romantically involved with anyone because I know my partner would just exceed me in every way. Besides, I'm ugly and no one finds me interesting enough to get to know me. I tell my family that I don't have a girlfriend because I enjoy being single, but I don't have a chance at romance anyways, so it's more of a way to pretend I'm happy with my life when I'm far from it. It never helps that my family is all happily married with the exception of me, my sister, and my smaller cousins, and I know I'll never get that kind of fulfillment or happiness. I'm also heavily jealous of my sister. She's successful in almost everything she does, and, since I've shared plenty of the teachers she had the year or two years before, they always expect the patented Zech brand work ethic. I don't have it. I love my sister and it hurts me to know how jealous I am of her. I can't help but feel that way even if I wish her the best of luck in life, the kind of luck I'll never enjoy. I don't feel like arguing whether it's luck or drive that determines success- I lack both and it hardly matters to me anyways. I've never owned a social media profile on account of how mundane my life is, and I plan to keep it that way until I die, whether that be tonight or eighty years of pointless struggle from now. My family is also heavily religious. One primary reason I haven't committed suicide yet is because I'm afraid of the eternal punishment the pastors and parents are always harping about. I can't even work up the courage to do the one thing I want most- to just end it all. At this point I would much rather have taken the lot of an innocent child in a third world country that died of a horrible disease when they were in an infant. At least my replacement would make SOMETHING out of these stupid gifts I'm supposed to have. I won't.  I'll never surpass or meet the expectations of those around me. I've looked around online about why it is that I depend so much on peer approval, and apparently it's because I don't rely on my own expectations and desires enough. The thing is, I HAVE no desires, save for ending this cycle of monotony and loneliness. I can't set expectations because I'll just fall short, just like every other time I've tried. I hate life, I hate expectations on me that I'll never meet, I hate the unfairness that I'll never fix, I hate that I'm a coward, I hate that I'll never give back all of the resources that were raised on my pointless upbringing, and yet I love the idea of leaving it all behind, for better or worse. I regret not working harder to make my own fate, to blaze my own path in this horrible world, but it's a tad bit late for that, isn't it?
If I respond or update, it's because I chickened out again. But every delay just lets me realize how much more useless and incompetent I am. It's like walking along a pier blindfolded- I know I'm getting closer, and I know I'll walk off the edge one day, but I'll never know exactly when it's about to happen until it does."

"I feel like I very well might be dead by the end of next week and I'm very very scared. :(I've always had a fear of death and there have been many times that is the only thing that has kept me alive.

This time I'm very scared may be different. 

I could sit here and list all the things that are wrong with my life, but I feel like that's just a competition in sadness. I know I don't have the worst life on earth- I just have the worst life for me.

I'm 30, on the brink of being very very lonely- the one person who was there for me seems to want to head for the exit and as such leaves me with no one. I took a risk... after all the horrible horribleness of my life before him I didn't know I could try one more time... and I did... and now I'm paying for it.

There's an incident I can pinpoint where I should have died about 5 years ago, and everyday I think the fates that be made a mistake. If energy cannot be created or destroyed... then I feel like all I am doing is preventing someone or something else from living that could do better with this energy than me. 

I'd say I have nothing to look forward to- I do. It's just every time the darkness follows. For once in my life I was entirely completely loved and happy... and now I find myself in a lower pit then I even began.

I'm thinking the week after next might be a good time to go for it, because it's the 2nd anniversary of my mother's death and if there is something after this, maybe I have her to go to.

I wish life didn't hate me so much. There's so much beautiful in it that I just wish I could be part of.   "
"I'm alone and depressed and I can't get out of thisReddit, I don't have anywhere else to turn. I'm an 18yo Male from NYC, and I'm really scared I'm not going to be able to keep going. This is my story:

I think I've had some form of depression since I was 9 or 10. As far back as that, I've always remembered not really liking myself, thinking that everyone was better than me in every way, and in general having way less motivation to do things that I should. I also know that I have Maladaptive Daydreaming Disorder, a condition where basically one has incredibally detailed and intricate daydreams, which often serve to counter one's own perceived inadaquacies. In my daydreams, I'm not inadequate at all, but I command a massive fleet of starships that basically guard the planet. Whenever I am feeling seriously awful, I bring myself into this world, and everything is okay again. 

I haven't always known that my conditions matched up to some form of depression. For a while I've been in and out of psych offices. Some tested me for ADD, others for Asbergers, but nothing ever really fit. I didn't self harm, I didn't really consider suicide, so I never set off those alarms. 


(names changed for privacy reasons)

Then I met Sally, my first girlfriend. She was the sweetest, gentlest, most empathetic person I have ever met. She also had extremely serious depression, with a suicide attempt and a long history of cutting to her name. She and I felt a powerful connection, and for three months we were extremely happy together. At around three months together, however, a series of events in her life came together, and she tried to take her life again. While she survived, she was sent into extremely serious psychiatric treatment several states away, and through a combination of her experiences there and my own worsening depression, we drifted apart and broke up. 

My other closest friend has been a girl I'll call Kate (she's a redditor too, so fake name). Kate and I share a bunch of similarly nerdy intrests, we're both nerdfighters (DFTBA), both love mass effect, and have all sorts of similar traits. After breaking up with Sally, Kate was the only person who was really there for me, and was with me for a lot of the time as I began to discover that I had a very similar condition to the one that Sally had. With nothing hiding it anymore, I fell into a really ugly spiral of self harm, self hate, and suicidal thoughts. I was, however, able to tell it all to Kate, who's simple presence made it better. While she couldn't completely understand what I was going through, she was an open ear, and I told her everything about the way my brain works.
After returning from independent vacations, however, she seemed to start growing distant. Yesterday, I received an email telling me that my problems had grown too much for her to handle, and that I was using her as a therapist, rather than as a friend. She severed all contact with me, and has completely refused to awknowledge my existence since. The truth is, on my vacation, I actually began to have some of the same concerns myself, and I wanted to talk with her about them after we got back. She however, was extremely hesitant to meet with me in person, so we never had that talk.

I'm really scared and I don't know what to do. I have just left my senior year of high school and I've stopped talking to many of my old friends, since more often than not they'd trigger a depressive episode. The only really good friend I had was Kate, who has completely refused to ever talk to me again. I have a psychiatrist now, but he hasn't been very open to medication options, as he thinks that its all guesswork and nobody really knows what meds do.

I am completely alone, and I'm having trouble continuing to live. It quite simply hurts far too much for me to be able to endure, and I'm really worried that, if this continues, I'm going to wind up taking my own life. I can't see another way to stop this pain. What can I do, Reddit?"

So I failed a psychology course and I feel miserable and hopeless right now.I am trying my best to cope with it but I just feel hopeless right now. I feel worthless. I donât know if I am depress or not but sometimes I do think that dying will make everything easier. I donât have to a burden to anyone and I donât have to feel so miserable. I donât have anyone I can talk to. Days arenât even getting better. What should I do? I tried my best but I failed. I feel like no university will accept me. I feel shit right now. And sometimes I feel that there are people who are trying their best to live and I think they deserve more than me to live. I donât know what to do. I have no one I can talk to. Plz help I donât want to feel so miserable. I... I donât know what to do in my life. I feel like I donât deserve to live. I am really a big loser."
"RelapsingI've read hundreds of other posts from people in the same position that I'm in. Our situations are different, our triggers are all different, but... we are all at our breaking points and I'm no different.

I've struggled for years with suicidal ideation. It's gotten bad enough at times where I've attempted suicide or came close to attempting it. Last week I drove to a park near my house and planned on shooting myself in the head in the middle of the woods so that there wouldn't be much cleanup. Even in my own death, I'm thinking of others. I wasn't going to shoot my self in my car because it would render it useless to my family. I've tried pills in many forms; prescription sleeping pills and opioids and washing those down with alcohol. I've come close but once taken, I've chickened out and called someone to say goodbye or to tell them what's going on so they're not so shocked and it ends up as me reaching out and being saved.

I'm feeling suicidal again. I know my many triggers - the most prevalent one being my own self. I hate who I am. How I treat people. I always try to do right by everyone but end up fucking things up. I'm stubborn to a fault. I'm always letting people down and disappointing them and it's just a never ending cycle of them reminding me what a disappointment and what a failure I am. This has started to include my boyfriend, whom I've let down more than multiple times in recent weeks. He doesn't have faith in me and his feelings are justified from the many times I've failed him.

It's just getting overwhelming again and I'm terrified that it's going to come back to suicide, the way it always has and always does... and I've moved on from pills and booze to just using my gun because I know the gun will get the job done. I'm terrified it's going to come down to that.

I don't need advice, really. I'm sitting on the floor in my bathroom in a pool of tears and I just needed to vent since I have no one to talk to. This seemed like such an appropriate place, even if it's just strangers reading it. I feel like such a hypocrite telling others to hang in there and that things will get better when I can barely follow my own advice.

I'm trying my hardest, I really am. But I don't know what's going to happen to me. If you're reading this, I know you feel alone... but you're not alone. I'm feeling the same way. Maybe things will get better or maybe they won't. Only time will tell. My heart has been broken by my own hands and I don't know how to pick the pieces back up. I don't know how to stop crying and get up off of this floor.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. You don't have to leave a comment unless you feel compelled to. I just needed to have my thoughts put out there, even if it's the last time somebody gets to read them, even if it's the last time I'll ever say anything. I've lived a great life and I'm not sure what the future holds for me but I'm happy I was given the time I've been given.

All my love to everyone.

"I need helpThe last bit of my life has been very tough. I feel like I should share my life story and talk to some people here.

When I was about 13 I started to have bad depression and anxiety. I missed almost everyday either due to asthma or anxiety. I didn't feel like I was fitting in. I went to a private school in my town and the people there were cruel. When I was diagnosed with depression I told my cousin who also had depression and he told all my friends at school. For the next while they all made fun of me for missing school and having depression, it made me feel like I trusted my cousin and he completely destroyed me. Towards the end of the school year I ended up beating up a kid who has been bullying me for roughly 12 years. It was so satisfying. Since the private school I went to has a no tolerance for fights I ended up getting expelled. I though I basically has immunity since my grandfather has donated millions of dollars to that school, but I didn't... I was really sad that I got kicked out and I was forced to go to public school. It was very scary going from 80 kids in my grade to 450. I was very overwhelmed and it made me go to school even less. By the Christmas of 9th grade I was going to my friends parties and was doing a lot of recreational drugs and drinking alcohol and I was getting into trouble. My parents found out and they are super conservative and they got really upset and kept a closer eye on me, this made me very mad. In April of 2015 I was sent to a psychiatric hospital and was diagnosed with bipolar depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I was there for 2 weeks and it was hell. It made me even more sad. A big reason I was depressed and anxious is because my 24 year old brother was getting married in June. On the night of his rehearsal dinner at his wedding my two brothers and my brothers groomsmen convinced me to drink with them but they didn't know I had been drinking before. I downed a first drink of whiskey and coke and they were impressed. Soon I didn't know what was going on and I blacked out. Apparently at 2:30 am the hotel manager found me on the penthouse floor of the hotel passed out in a puddle of vomit. I was rushed to the emergency room and had a BAC of .15. I almost died that night because of my stupid decisions. In July of 2015 I was sent to a wilderness program called second nature in Utah. I was there for 9 weeks and it was actually fun. Afterwards I figured my parents would never send me to boarding school, but they did. I was really upset and it made me more depressed again. 7 months later and it's April and I'm home for surgery and will be home for another couple of weeks. I really can't go back to that place that tortures me. The school is very bad and they have terrible staff that are really mean. Tonight I yelled at my parents for being very controlling and at my mom for drinking a lot. When she drinks it really bothers me because she always says ""ThrowfarawayDrugs, take your medicine."" Every couple of minutes even though I took them the first time she asked. 

That is my story, sorry if I sounded like a Whiney brat but that's how I see it and it makes me really consider whether I should kill myself or not. "
"Hello, my name is Chris.I'm positive that I want to die ,but killing yourself isn't all that easy. I've always been on to look on the bright side for the most part but I'm just too tired now. I'm always exhausted. The worst part is that there's not even a big reason to be depressed. Basic problems everyone else has. The one that bothers me the most is that I sometimes just break down crying. I'm a 25 year old fucking man, and bawl my fucking eyes out for no discernible reason. It's been such a pain in the ass hiding that from coworkers, friends, and family. Maybe part of it is that I'm the only one out of my family and friends that isn't married or have a fucking kid. Hell I haven't even had a girlfriend in a long time. Maybe it's my little brother, or dad, or grandpa dying. (suicide/stroke/cancer). Maybe its just that I've been telling myself telling myself it's going to get better for too long and it never has. I couldn't even begin to tell you how many years I've been doing it. I've got a loaded .38 special on my end table ,and a bottle of tequila. I hope I have the balls to pull finish it this time."
I sometimes harm myself or think about killing myself for attentionThere have been times in my life where I have actually been suicidal and almost killer myself but other time I think about how people would react to that and it kind of makes me want to do it. I also used to also act like I was going to kill myself to get sent to a mental hospital. But at the same time I kinda did want to die. Am I a bad person. And recently Iâve imagined hanging myself and I cut tonight but wonât show anyone so I donât know if itâs for attention. Any thoughts?

"It is a world completely sad, where the low sullen skies seem about to rain pure horror from above. (Long post). iI am lost. Iâm a 26 year old woman with nothing to show for my life. I barely graduated high school, took time off after because I didnât know what to do, eventually ended up going to a shady for profit school (Phoenix), because it was easy admission and brick and mortar schools scare me too much. I did end up finishing my AA there in Elementary Ed, which was a complete waste and I have no desire to work with kids or teach them. That has left me with 26k in loans. 

I donât have any friends. Itâs hard for me to get close to people. The only person I communicate with on a daily basis is my cat. 

I have two credit cards in collections (2k total), my credit is awful. The only jobs I have ever worked are retail ones and they go smoothly at first and I think everything is going to come up milhouse, but there is always an issue. Iâve been sexually harassed, Iâve had my hours cut because I spoke up about the negative treatment, Iâve worked in a situation where I was the only one on the registers on a busy sale weekend, and I was trying to go as fast as I can, but the entire time I was being scolded over the radio by my manager for not stocking the food items up front or putting merchandise back. 

Iâve been unemployed since the end of March after I reported the unfair treatment from
the sexual harassment job and HR decided nothing was wrong and implied that I was making it up, so I quit. Iâve tried to search for jobs and have been rejected over and over again. I had a promising interview with a credit card company for a wonderful position, did several phone interviews, and never heard back from them. That destroyed any confidence I had left. I live with roommates and I am grateful that I have shelter, but thereâs no money left. I have $40 in my bank account. I do mturk to try and make some sort of money, but it will not be enough for bills I have due in a week. I just have no hope. 

I want to go back to school (Iâve applied to WGU) and I think that is the right decision, but I donât know if I can make it that far. Both of my parents were addicts and I swore to never follow that path, and I havenât. But recently Iâve been mixing benzos prescribed to me and alcohol. Itâs not enough. Itâs not destroying me like I wish it would. Iâm just hopeless, I feel like a burden, Iâm disappointed in myself. My mother always told me growing up that I was worthless, that I would never amount to anything, that Iâd end up alone, and as much as I hate her, sheâs right. Mother does know best. 

I just wish I had an opportunity, a chance to change my life, to show someone that I am
capable and smart and a hard worker, but it is just not happening. 

So why try anymore? Why would I continue to live? Iâm just a waste. Iâm so sorry that this post is so long. "

"It's been 8 yearsHi all, 
I'm 18, f, and have been struggling for 8 years with mental health issues. I'm really really struggling. For background I am diagnosed with depression, two forms of anxiety, EDNOS, BPD and pseudohallucinations. I've had over 15 admissions to hospital due to self harm/suicide attempts and have been admitted to an inpatient mental health facility a couple of years ago for several months.
I thought I was doing well, I haven't self harmed in a while but feel so fucking low and suicidal. I have an amazing family but don't want to put them through any more stress or worry after everything that's gone on the past couple of years. I've been passed around different therapies/therapists but since I've just turned 18 and the services are slow as hell im just kind of hanging here with no professional support. 
I want to live deep down, but I can't get past the voice in my head that has been with me for so long telling me to just call it quits. I don't want to hurt my family, but I am so so lonely and don't feel like I'm leading a 'normal' 18 year old life.
Any advice or support would be very much appreciated, thank you"

I live with the person who used to sexually abuse me and no one gives a shit. If I slice up my fucking wrists and scream will people care? I am tired I am so fucking tired of no on ecaring i am done"

"I am thinking of commiting suicideFirst of all, I 'm a 17 male , and I hate everything about my life . I talked to my parents but they didn't even tried to stop me . I was actively trying to get a professional to diagnose me but they did not do anything ( they are not monsters just really old , they have never physicaly abused me). Over the past month I have been finding comfort in self harm . On top of that schooled started and anxiety is taking over and it is too much . My friends aren't even bothering to ask if I'm okey , even after seeing the marks and some even told me that it is my fault .I hqve begged many people for help with no response. I have nobody and I am desperate, all this is way too much for me to handle. I have decided to end my life today night with pills but I really want to change that . I need someone to talk me out of this but I'm afraid to call suicide prevention. Please Help"
"Just got out of the hospitalAbout two weeks-ish ago I slit an artery in my wrist and passed out from blood loss. Unfortunately, I woke up in a hospital later that night, where I was then sent to a mental institution. I spent almost two weeks there and am finally getting out."
"don't matter, just saying my peace.I wish that there was more to say but there is not. I tried and i failed and just want somewhere to be a record that i have tried my best. Gave all i had but it was not enough, but such is life eh? I had been with the same person for the past near 10 years. Lost a child with her, new born daughter she had congenital diaphragmatic hernia. She too fought but lost made it almost a month when doctors said she would have hours. Had a son with her. Wonderful kid if not a bit insane but smart and clever as hell. He kept me hanging on for a while, not his fault at all. Hes a good kid almost six now. Then almost ten years after meeting her while i was recovering from surgery and my mother going through cancer which took her, his mother said she would be here. love me, be there forever. Month ago after sticking with this woman thick and thin find out shes been seeing an ex flame she ran in to again on face book and screwing him behind my back. Now she wants him to move in and me out. by monday none the less. my reward for being a stay at home dad, devoted to her and my child is this: an hotel room thats not even in my name for 6 weeks tops while i try to sort out and start a new life and that fuck face takes my old one. my house, my child, my things, my ex.  Part of me could say hell with it, i can do this. but and there is always a but, due to a mix up or what ever when my mother died past few years i havent had a birth certificate, meaning no real ID. Now this is the crux of the matter. Some people have their identity stolen, not me. No mine just got up one night and wandered off. So here i sit one day till the next morning i wake up, kiss my son good bye and go to an cheap motel with a mini fridge and microwave and am told ""to make it on my own"" with out even my name or a dollar in my pocket. I tried. Damn did i try. This is just too much though. I don't want to do this any more, its not fair and its not right. All i really hope for is the new guy treats my son well and that his mother tells him i was an ok guy. All i want is this, My name is Will, and i tried. Remember that for me ok? Thank you and sorry for the wall of text."

"Long Annoying Whine-Rant of a Disaffected LoserI'm 27 and I feel like my life is slipping through my fingers.

I went to college for art, but as soon as the going got tough I stopped improving and just sort of gave up. Something I wanted so badly now just seems so far out of reach. It's been five years since we graduation and my work pales in comparison to people graduating from my college now. It's pathetic. I'm pathetic.

I've always been driven by recognition and success. I was a straight A student in K-12, graduated valedictorian from high school. Everything started to crumble in my junior year of college, and I graduated college with a 3.495. Just under the grade to get summa cum laude. Five years later and I'm still exactly where I was when I graduated. Nowhere.

I'm working a dead-end contract job in California for something that's pretty cool, admittedly. It's just not what I went to school for, what I wanted to be doing with my life. Even though I'm making decent money, I can't help but feel that I failed. I've been promoted and it isn't enough. I go through the motions every day now, watching the clock. Saying to myself ""I'll work on art when I get home"", and it never happens. Never. It's so embarrassingly pathetic.

My art hasn't improved since graduation, because I haven't bucked down to work on it. I seem to be full of excuses; oh today was stressful, oh I didn't sleep well last night, oh I deserve a break after the stress of doing this one small chore I was outting off for days. I deserve nothing because I haven't earned the right to say I'm stressed or tired. How dare I say I'm tired or stressed when there's so many people out there, working their hardest to improve, while I sit here and do nothing but whine about how I haven't gotten a job in my art? It's disgusting. Annoying. I must sound so stupid to others.

I know my friends and family care about me. I have a wonderful fiance who loves me. I just can't help but feel like I'm letting them all down. Like the money my mom took out for my degree went to waste. I tell my friends about everything I'm feeling and I can't help but think they're getting sick of it. They've been hearing it for years, my excuses and whining. It must be getting old. Most of my family doesn't really understand mental illness so there's no point in telling them.

Some people would say ""oh well you don't have to do great things, being average is ok"", and to that I say bullshit, at least as far as I'm concerned. If other people want to do that, that's great for them. For me though, I may as well just give up and lay in front of a train. If I'm not striving for greatness, what good am I? If I'm not trying to create something that will benefit someone else, some day, what's the point of me being here? If all I want to do is just live and be happy for myself, that'd the lost selfish and lowly thing I could think of doing. 

In short, I'm an artist who doesn't do art; a wannabe, a has-been. A person who thrives on recognition, which is the most flippant way of being happy, but it's all I've known, and I'm too lazy and pathetic for my work to get recognition anymore. I've done nothing special or important with my life, and at this rate I never will.

I don't even know why I'm getting up tomorrow. I really don't. All I do is disappoint myself every day. I could just be done with it and everything would be better off. Me, my friends, my family, the world. One less failure making everything worse and whining about it. One less disappointment.

If you read this far into this intelligible diatribe, I'm sorry. A waste of time, to be sure. Hopefully you'll rise above this and become the things I can't; happy, fulfilled, successful, contented. I'm too far gone."

"Not sure what, or how to feel anymore.The days seem to blur together now. My body feels weak and I can hardly think when I'm alone. However that's all I am now, alone. The people in my life have cut me out because I am no longer fun to be around. I'm sorry, but the desire to want to kill myself makes it difficult to clap my hands and dance for you. To respond to every text, to smile at your jokes and assure you everything is going to be OK when it comes to your needs. the one upping everyone does to me with their problems, even though I wasn't sharing. People just assume I'm better off when they don't know me and don't want to get to know me.

We don't really have access to guns in my country. However, I often think of taking one to my temple and imagining the sudden nothing that will free me from this dread, this despair and desperation I have accumulated for myself. Maybe if I didn't seek sympathy or empathy in this world I would be better off. Or wish to feel desired or have someone to come home to, maybe if I was OK with being alone for the rest of my life.

Without the courage to commit the act, I just wait in darkness, in silence. Every day while I bring myself to tears surrounded by nostalgia and memories. Sometimes I remind myself of the old feeling, the warm feeling you get when you remember something from way back. Those memories seem to bring more pain than my desperation now.

I'm thrown for such a loop that I'm not even sure if I should feel hollow, or break out into tears every time I realize my place in this world. I feel like I've been cursed, like I am forbidden from feeling any happiness or relief. From sharing this life with another. The remaining people in my world are cruel and abuse my kindness that I feel forced to give. All in hopes that someone will see me. Hoping, that someone will look at me and acknowledge that I was once a human being."
"partner left me; dont feel okayOver the past few years I've been going to a counselor to talk about issues I've had with gender identity, namely that I've been wanting to transition since I was very little ~9 or 10 (now 22). Weve been discussing options and talking through all of them and I decided to tell my NB partner of 6 married years (who fully understands this process, being biologically female but identifying as nonbinary and has heard about my own problems before) that i was getting serious about transitioning. I thought I was safe because they are actively considering top surgery as well as changing their name, etc.
They broke up with me point blank because they were so disgusted with the idea of dating a man that they couldn't handle it, just too gay for me. Despite them being asexual, never seeing my genitals and probably never would after the transition (not that that much changes down there?). 
I respect their choice, I understand they have all their own right to taste and preference and all that but I just feel like I'm at a loss.  I know I can't get them back and I will respect the choices they made, but I feel like at this point going through with this without support isnt an option, and not going through with it will render me miserable and I still wont have this one person that made my life bearable. I was hopelessly in love. I've already hurt the relationship too badly. 
I've been mulling it over for a few days, and amoung other mental and physical disabilities that made me give up my dream career, no family to speak of, and no friends besides shared ones with my spouse that I feel weird making take sides, I don't think theres much left going for me. 

I don't know where to turn. Why did I destroy my life like this. I was happy enough. Now theres no saving it.

"Don't know what to do anymore.Hello other redditors,
First of all excuse me if i make any spelling mistakes because i'm dyslexic.
I won't mention my name because of obvious reasons but i will say that i'm a 16 year old, pretty normal i suppose, get pretty good grades in school, i'm not a trouble maker or anything like that and i just do my own thing.
Lately alot of stuff has been going on like my parents are divorced and they're fighting alot, my grandmother passed away and i saw my father after a few years of actually not seeing him again (at the funeral), everyone gets mad at me recently for whatever reason they can think of and I honestly don't think i'm doing anything wrong, I don't really get bullied or anything either I just think of myself as any other guy, except for some people that might also mean cheating and stuff like that but i will never do that.

Okay so that describes a bit of my problems, now the rest of it.
So i have a girlfriend and I really really love her alot and I sometimes feel like she doesn't feel the same way but i hope to god that she does.
I want to give her everything I possibly can, I work as a stocker, I won't mention the name of the store I work in.
So I earn my money and I want to spend it on her and she knows I want to get her a promise ring but she doesn't want me to do that, but lately she's been quite stressed and says she wants to take a break from everything including me which really felt like my heart just got ripped into a billion pieces..
I don't know what to do with my life anymore she's everything that matters to me and I don't want to lose her, ever.
Really all i want is just to have a simple life with her for as long as we breathe.

I've been thinking about killing myself lately and i'm scared of dying which i think is normal for everyone.
I don't want to die but sometimes i feel like i have no other choice anymore.
I have a psychiatrist, i don't see him alot anymore though, i just feel completely lost and i don't know what to do.

Story short:
My girlfriend means the world to me, I don't want to lose her ever, I just want to spend my life with her.
She wants to take a break from everything because she says she's stressed which includes taking a break from me,
which ofcourse i don't accept because i feel like i'm about to lose her.
So now i want to die pretty much.

Help me please?"

(a little background)

I come from an abusive family, my dad was a bi polar alcoholic and would beat me and made me feel worthless for the majority of my life. My mom eventually did a very brave thing and divorced him. But I fear the damage was already done.( I have been to therapy in the past and never found it overly useful) I've wanted to die as far back as I can remember. 

Now that that's out of the way, a couple of days ago I was half asleep alone in my apt,watching tv when I started to hear people yell for help I thought maybe someone had fallen/heart attack, something of the like so I got up, threw on some clothes and went to investigate. The first thing I see is a man in the hallway asking for help so I followed him to an apt a few doors down and when I got there I was shocked, busted door, blood everywhere, and to the right of my I see a man standing over a woman in a lot of pain with a huge knife.

I didn't know what to do,I'm not the most intimidating person (I resemble the comic book guy from the Simpsons) and this guy starts walking over to me and in that split second I was afraid of dying so I lied and told him that the cops where on the way (turns out someone had actually called them) he stood there for a few seconds and then ran off.

It took awhile but once the cops/paramedics arrived they got the woman to the hospital and brought me to the police station to give my statement. From what I've heard she is in a stable condition but haven't heard much else.

Right now I'm wishing this guy had killed me and I'm really fucked up emotionally and don't really know what to do. I can't really talk about this with my family they know some of the details of the events but not what I'm really going through, I'm usually an emotional wall and keep people at a distance, and my friends have all moved on with their lives and I don't want to involve them with this.

I will be going to bed for a little while as it is fairly late or early depending how you see it

"One minute Iâm stable. The next minute Iâm debating hanging myself.I have BPD. Itâs utterly exhausting how fast my mood can shift. It used to be that my moods would shift over the course of a couple days. Now it can bounce back and forth between extremes several dozen times in a single day.

Yesterday morning (12/3) I woke up in an extremely bad place. Iâve been displaying escalating parasuicidal behavior for several weeks. Weâre talking using a pellet gun that looks very much like a Glock as a prop to try to get people to acknowledge and validate how shitty and horrible I feel. Also, to get them to help me dig out from the hole Iâve dug for myself, because I have no clue how to climb out on my own.

Iâve also been extremely manic, but itâs not random mania. Itâs a manic urge to hide from my emotional turmoil and pain. Weâre talking things like getting in my car and driving 1,400 hundred miles, blowing literally all of my savings and maxing out my credit cards on a fancy hotel and ridiculous dinners for two weeks, and also just cruising around in my car to the tune of an additional 5,000 miles because why the hell not.

The manic energy scares me. Especially when combined with the rapidly cycling moods and my massive impulse control issues. Itâs a recipe for disaster.

I spent my day having heart to heart talks with my mom and my best friend on the phone. I spent over 6 hours talking on the phone total between the two of them. And I felt better while talking to them. But within 30 minutes of each call ending, I started having feelings of despair and hopelessness consume me again. And itâs not just the feelings that are the issue. Itâs the urges and impulses. When I feel a particularly strong wave of emotion hits me, my first thought is about hanging myself or stepping out in front of a bus. Iâve felt these urges wash over me several times today. I came very close to giving into the temptation of stepping in front of the bus, I literally started sweating in 30 degree weather because I was so close to doing it. I walked around for a few hours afterwards in a daze/dissociated state while silently crying.

I moved to a new hotel room and I spent at least 30 minutes examining the room to find the best place to anchor my belt or the bathrobeâs belt. I do this basically anywhere I post up for a night. Honestly Iâm always scanning my surroundings to see what my best path out of living is in that moment, just in case I decide to indulge the urge. Itâs like Iâm always planning.

Now as I lay in bed, Iâll feel okay for a few minutes. Then a thought that triggers a strong emotion will run through my head, and the next thing you know Iâm literally mentally picturing myself taking necessary steps to hang myself. Then 5 minutes later, Iâm back to being calm and collected. 10 minutes after that, another triggering thought pops into my head and I go back to fantasizing about ending it all.

The rapid oscillation between being okay one minute and then being ready to wrap a belt around a closet hanger bar the next minute, is very exhausting. Itâs very unpleasant. Itâs just an unwanted roller coaster ride. Worst of all, these kinds of rapid and massive emotional state changes and urges are increasingly common in my life... To a level that is frankly mentally crippling.

I donât want to die. But I feel like, out of my very limited and very shitty options, dying is the most favorable outcome. Itâs still a shitty choice, but none of my other options (staying alive and letting go of the past that I dearly miss) are desirable given my emotional issues.

This all just sucks so much, and Iâm so beyond down and exhausted from it all. I just want some stability."
"There should be a post with known pedos users tagged so people know who to avoid Obvisouly there are alot of flaws with this plan due to people sending death threats to them, but frick em if they are pedos Name and heckin Shame. 

It also means we can mass report them unless that isnt allow?

Obvisouly the mods would need solid evidence of them actually trying to groom a teen to be able to tag em but i think its a good idea.

do you agree with this? the star wars franchise is dead but the older movies will still always be timeless
Every day I feel less like myself and Iâm at the point where I donât even recognise myself anymoreI just feel like Iâm such a different person because I canât even enjoy the things I used to enjoy a canât feel things I used to feel and I lost people that were really close to me and it didnât affect me like I thought it would I thought Iâd feel pain or Iâd miss them but I was just indifferent. I feel like I donât have the energy to get out of bed let alone live. Iâve been in a dark place recently and I just want to feel something because Iâm so tired of feeling nothing and emptiness
Just Told my Parents Dont know How to Feel I just opened up to my parents about my depression and I don't even know how to feel. They really cared about me and told me that we would find therapy and stuff after quarantine ends. But then they kinda brushed it off as depression and said I'm not really depressed but it's just a phase and that I shouldn't use the phrase depressed. I feel kinda relieved that I have my parents to help me through this but at the same time I just feel the same way as if I didn't tell my parents and I really thought telling them would help ease my depression but it really didn't. I'm currently a shit show on the inside a bunch of mixed 'feelings'(ig but idek what feelings or emotions are at this point). Hoping someone can help plz. :)
"I always though it would be me.I always thought it would be me. We both struggled with depression, but I was the one who isolated, who slept for days and self harmed. He was a talented athlete and always craving life experiences, even if he was never really satisfied.


I was in lab, halfway across the country when I got the call. My sister, who is his age and who was never close to to him, was on the other end.

Her: Jill?

Me: what's wrong

Her: silence

Her: silence

Her: noises, not human 

Me: take a deep breath. I'm here. What happened?

Her: noises, heavy breathing (is she crying?)

Me (cold sweat): Ellie what's going on? Take a deep breath

Her: Alex Jones committed suicide. 

Me (stepping into the hallway): what I can't hear you speak up

Her: Alex Jones committed suicide.

Me (voice breaking): Alex Jones committed suicide?

Her: yes

Me: how?

Her: he shot himself. John (his dad) found him.

Me (voice is high pitched and broken): he shot himself?

Me: what about his siblings? Were they there?

Her: no they were at summer camp. 



I asked her many more questions but none of the answers were satisfying. He was 18 and going off to college this fall. I had known him since I was four and he was two. We were next door neighbors and best friends when we were little. My dad delivered his younger siblings when they were born. Our families were intimately connected. When i was ten I started nanny his siblings and did it until I was 16. I drove him to school every day in highschool. He was in love with me for years. I didn't reciprocate because of my relationship with his family. We talked all the time about everything. He knew things that no one else knows. I have so many memories, I can hear his voice. I went away to college two years ago. We still kept in touch every few months. He was happy, had a girlfriend and a part time job and was doing well in school. He apologized for hitting on me so aggressively in highschool. I told him I forgave him and understood and he was so relieved. We had wonderful talks. He was going to be an amazing man.

We were supposed to be lifelong friends. He was going to do amazing things. Why didn't he reach out when things got bad? I've been suicidal before. I understand the mindset. I just can't imagine how he felt when he pulled the trigger. And what about his siblings? My neighborhood? His siblings lives will be forever changed. They will always be the kids who's older brother shot himself in their house. All the neighboorhood kids looked up to him. They all lost their innocence today. Alex shot himself. What about his family? are they still in the house where he died? What about his dad? How will he ever get over finding his child in a pool of blood? What about his body? I don't want to think about it cold, sitting in a coroners office or funeral home. I just can't believe it. He was fine. He had a future. He was loved. It wasn't supposed to be him. We are devastated.

"Gotta Do It SometimeI feel like I'm in limbo going through the motions of life. What's the point? I've either got to nut up and end it or nut up and do something.

What's waiting around going to get me?"
"Just looking for some advice!So i'm in college. It's fun and I enjoy it but this year i've taken on a lot more responsibility than I've had in the past. I have a job and I'm an officer for a club sports team which is quite a big time commitment, in addition to being a student. I've just felt really overwhelmed lately, almost crushingly so. I've called my parents and talked to them, and all they seem to be saying is that it's part of growing up and that this is how life is. 

I'm not suicidal, but it's something i've consistently had thoughts about  since probably middle school. I don't think i would ever do it but sometimes i just wonder why more people don't? it seems pretty hopeless. You go to school to get a job that will make you enough money to send your kids to college so they can get jobs to make enough money to send their kids to college...sometimes i think maybe having a family or something would be rewarding but at the same time I would feel bad bringing someone into this world who would have to suffer through this same bullshit. 

Anyone have some advice on why life isn't just a huge suckfest?"
"Can't sleep, can't deal with lifeIt all feels so pointless I feel there is absolutely no reason for me to be around anymore "
"I just want to be told I did the right thing.I checked myself into the emergency room yesterday because I didnât think Iâd be able to pull myself back from the edge on my own again. It was incredibly difficult for me to do. I still feel so ashamed and vulnerable. My friend had to drive me there and miss work for several minutes to do so because I lost my keys, and Iâm so grateful to him, but Iâm scared that heâs exhausted from having to listen to me so often these past few weeks. Iâm afraid when he reassures me Iâm not a burden that heâs just lying so I donât kill myself. 

My family is making it about themselves and I feel so raw and naked from taking the steps I did and Iâm terrified that I did the wrong thing. Im having a hard time stopping myself from thinking I should have just not said anything about the danger I was in and gone through with it. 

Iâm so scared that Iâve fucked up everything for myself by trying to get help and I know itâs not rational but I canât stop myself from feeling that way. 

Nobody seems to understand how hard it was to make that decision to live. I did it for them, I did it so they wouldnât *have* to deal with the grief of losing me. So many people have been treating me like a cornered animal and the worst part is that theyâre probably right to. I feel so shaky and so alone."
maybe i should delete reddit hmmmmmmmm
This sucks but Im probably going to have to do it soon.I fucked things up. I keep fucking things up. I have a job interview for Monday that I got because my mom drove me to the place. I can barely leave my house 6 days out of the week so how the fuck am I going to be ok to work any day. If I fuck up my interview that gives me more time I guess. My ex who I was slowly fixing things with saw that I like a shit ton of girls pictures on instagram. It sounds shallow and sick as fuck but thats all I want to do. Sleep around. But it doesnt work because I cant leave the house because I feel like shit. I have no other goals or ambitions. I literally can't do this anymore. I just need the courage.

"Socially isolated, unemployed, 34This is a strange post for me to make because I should have made it 4-8 years ago when I realised what a horrible rut I was in... now I'm hopeful I might finally get out of it somehow but still getting moments of melancholy and despair.

I've been unemployed for the better part of 10 years since I left university - whenever I got a job it was either a short term thing or I was freelancing so not full time. Over time I started to lose contact with friends as I became more and more ashamed of my predicament. The job situation and making money has been a big problem for me.

My problem is that I was always into creative endeavours like film, acting, writing... so I've spent time following those stupid, dead end passions, which means I can only either get shit jobs, jobs I don't want OR I enter a very competitive market I largely now despise for how fake it is. Anyway I might have a chance to get good work as an editor/motion graphics guy as I spruce up my skills but it's still ultra competitive and I wish I had picked something more sensible. My life could have been so much better as I learnt and evolved rather than stagnating as I have done.

Another thing is I have a good few successful old schoolmates who are successful, rich, married, jetsetting around the world and happy, happy, happy while I live a SHIT, SHIT, SHIT, SHIT life (now back living with my folks!). Makes me so annoyed I turned out so fucked up and lonely when my earlier life was so full of potential.

At this point I feel I need a miracle to happen to get my life anywhere near where it should be - and even if I get out of my situation and suddenly get a job I don't hate - will I ever be satisfied? Will I find someone great to settle down with? Settle down with where? With what money? It might have been my situation which tainted everything but I've grown to despise the city of London where I live. It's like a prison - either join the rat race or die. SHITHOLE

Anyone in a similar situation?"
"First break up Man this shit hurts like holy goddamn shit i cant leave my room without breaking down into a fucking mess. he came out of the blue and laid it on me and my whole world collapsed. i don't really have any friends to tell this to so I've come here to rant. we were together 9 months and were looking forward for one year and dressing up for Halloween together but that's not going to happen unfortunately. when i went downstairs for dinner i broke down in front of my family and their friends. he broke up because of the lack of time we both had to spend with each other cause of school circumstances, and other family related stuff. so i feel horrible about being mad but i cant help it."

"I have no one to talk toFor the past year and a half I've been wanting to kill myself.  Almost every day.  I'm scared to, even though it feels worse to be alive.

My mom just tells me that I'm a waste of money.  When I've expressed to her that I didn't want to be alive, more often than not her response is ""Whatever"" or something similar.  When I first expressed it to my dad, he cried and hugged me.  I later told him again and he said ""How about I get you my gun and some shells and you can do it right now?""  I expressed it to my brother, and he called the police and I was on an involuntary hold in a psych hospital for three days (they almost forced me to stay for a week, because they were ""understaffed""), where they kept it freezing and I could hardly eat, both due to stress and because they didn't serve me anything my diet would allow.  They just forced me to take antidepressants, which didn't help.  Everything I was feeling was very much prevalent.

It's because of the last thing that I haven't told anyone since.  I quit therapy over a month ago because I can't afford it anymore.  I figured I might as well not get another job (after my last job closed) because my thought has been ""Well, I'm just going to kill myself anyways.""

I would rather die than be taken away involuntarily again.  It is traumatizing, at least to me.  And the worst part is, is that my parents don't care.  Nobody in my life cares about me or about my feelings.  It's always about them.

Most people say they stick around for their family, and I don't even have that.

There's a lot more that goes into it, why I don't want to live anymore, but I'll spare those details.

If I will do it, it will have to be tonight/tomorrow morning, which is a really scary thing to write out versus just think.

Honestly, I feel really bad about even writing this.  I don't want anyone to feel sad or feel bad because of this post.  I just needed to vent my feelings to someone without having to worry about being called crazy or being forced to go to a hospital."

"Hi everyone, i'm a gamedev. My goal is to reach 850 subscribers . If you enjoy the content you can subscribe cause that helps me a lot :) Here's the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyTgv-1i2FY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyTgv-1i2FY)"
tell me to do ittell me to kill myself and ill do it. just one person reply telling me to do it and I will. I need some motivation. 
"I am unsure of what to do.I am not necessarily suicidal... however, I have been having some very dark thoughts as of late and if the past is any indication, thoughts of a permanent solution may start to pop up in my head again. I don't know who to talk to. My two closest friends listen, but they are unsure of what to tell me. I cannot go to family. 

My job causes me quite a bit of stress and grief. There are many tasks to complete in a single day. I have numerous people that count on me so there is a lot of pressure to succeed. Despite being decent at what I do, sometimes I would like to simply disappear. However, this job pays better than other places around here and I do not have many choices as I live in a rural town. All the real opportunities are a few hours away and I don't have the finances to leave. 

The second source of my stress is school. I work full-time, I take classes full-time (they are online). I try my best to balance the two. I graduate in a year and a half with a bachelors. Ideally I would like to get a job in my field. 

My home life is not the greatest. My husband and I are separating. We still live together and financially support each other, but the situation is changing. To complicate matters, my mom also lives with us. I gave her a place to escape to when she was leaving an awful situation. I've let her live here without asking her to pay bills. She worries about the three bills of her own and that is it. Sometimes this feels like a mistake, because she gets terribly upset over small issues. Today, she threw a massive fit because I do not have cable anymore and she cannot watch football. I get so tired of being blamed for stupid shit. When I come home from work and I have a tiny bit of free time, I do not want to sit here and spend it getting screamed at. She's on the lease (stupid, I know). I can't simply kick her out and she's my mom.

Maybe I'm simply a wuss and I'm not cut out for any of this. I've had a lot of hurt in my life. I've told myself that I'm still quite young (only 24) and there's more to look forward to, but it's not working like it used to. I have a sense of dread every morning that I wake up. I'm not happy. Things that used to make me happy no longer make me happy. I know I'm depressed. I cannot think of a way to get myself out of this situation, if that's even possible. I don't know how to make the best of this. I am way too young to feel this hopeless about my life."
im feeling pretty pogchamp today idk bout you but something about today feels somewhat special...
"I donât understand my dad sometimes bruh My dads on a diet. Him and my mom both are on a diet which basically starves you to death for a month (itâs called Whole 30). And they have a few days left of the diet thingy. But tonight at dinner my dad was complaining about the diet. If I got a dollar for every time my dad complained about the diet, Iâd have 300$. My mom was getting kinda frustrated at him because she says that he complains too much about this. But they get into this sorta fight and like he gets all mad at her while Iâm still sitting there uncomfortable hearing it all unfold. Ans he says that like heâs gonna complain all he wants because it was his choice to do it and so on so forth. I start talking and say something along the lines of âif your just complaining to fill up empty space, then why complain at all?â Or something because he was saying he just complained sometime because he felt like it, and immediately after I say that, he becomes pissed. He goes on a five minute rant basically telling to my mom and I about how this is torture for him and how we canât say anything because we donât understand what heâs going through (even though my mom is doing the diet with him) and a lot of it was directed at me and at the end said âjust wait till your 40, then youâll understand how I feelâ and stormed off. It just hurts man. It hurts because every single time I do that, he gets furious at me. I canât say my mind and express how I feel without my dad yelling at me for having a different opinion than me. It just sucks man. After he storms off, in the next 5 hours he said one sentence to me saying goodnight and that was it. I said one sentence asking a question, and he ignores me for the rest of the night. Control your anger man! My sister and I both got that trait from him sadly, but we cannot control our anger very well. And my dad has never been able to control it. He always lets it out on me or my sister or even my mom. It just upsets me seeing him like that when I just asked a simple question. I hope this rant doesnât get taken down like the last rant I wrote yesterday night. I just wanna let out my feelings, Iâm not trying to be a karma whore. Thanks to the 3 people that read this far. Yeha."
"Just a quick message of encouragement.I know many of you have likely already scrolled past this thinking âYeah right, âencouragement.ââ And thatâs okay. But those of you who have clicked here out of curiosity or desperation, I have a few short words to share. I know that they are not much, but for your sake, Iâd appreciate it if you took these to heart.

Iâve never tried killing my self. Iâm not going to lie and say I know that feeling. But I can understand the emotions driving it.

No, Iâm not religious, and Iâm not here to spout about how god can save you. Iâm not sure if there is a god or gods, but that doesnât matter.

Life is a road, and yes, there is inevitably an end to it. But weâre on the scenic route, up until we arrive at our destination. 

Itâs not about getting there, to me. Itâs about what you see, the good, the bad, and the beautiful, that make it all worth it.

Iâm not very good at speeches, evidently, but if Iâm going to give you the long and short of it, itâs this; Youâre on a very long ride down a very long road. Now, you can choose to only look ahead to your destination, trying to find the shortest route there. Or, you can lean your head against the window, and play I spy for a little bit. Pick out the great things you see, and make a pretty collage to hang on your wall of memories.

Everyone here is doing their best to help out, however you may feel. There are friends here, in every place. We want to help you, so that you may help someone yourself someday. If you need anything, talk to people. Find something worth standing up and living for, and roll with it. Do your thing, and donât let anybody else tell you off. 

Thatâs all. Carry on, and carry yourself high. Take care, everyone."

"Itâs a passive decay.Every single day is a loss. Every joke I make; every smile I perform; every time I speak a part of my soul leaves my body. 

Itâs exhausting being alive. 

The moment I open my eyes the calling of death starts murmuring. No matter how happy the day was or how energetic  I was, itâs always the same at the end of the day: I wish I was dead. 

Thereâs no stimulus, no fun, no friends, no change, no energy. 

Lifeâs in the way, and at this point Iâd rather skip the wait."
"aight, so im confused af so basically. im AMAB (assigned male at birth) and i actually use male pronouns as well as female one sometimes. its kinda weird. but here is the thing. im a guy, not a girl or anything else. yet i feel really comfortable with being called a girl and shit. i mean i will actively tell stranger to use she/her just because its more comfortable. yet i am a guy, and i'd never see myself as trans. so basically, what drugs did i take. cause that is some really weird shit im thinking rn."

I feel useless worthless ugly stupid terrible but no one is around to listen. My boyfriend works 12 hours a day 5 days a week and he's always tired, and often napping so I can't exactly reach out to him. And my parents aren't being supportive of me, they are just so busy with their lives and the new baby that is coming. I feel like I'm losing my choices, and that soon I won't have any freedom, and that I will always have to be the babysitter for my parents and I will always have to do things for them. And what's the point of living if that's all I'm here for? I can't take it anymore. I've already written a note and I think I'll do it."

"(low priority) i finally started thinking about itI'm in no immediate danger. I'm not even sure this is the right subreddit for it.  

It's just... I've been doing great. I've been working on my career so it'd look great in my CV, my body is sore of the immense workouts, I'm studying a lot of things, I even managed myself brushing teeth twice a day instead of once (or none at all). I have even read a fiction book, for the first time in, like, 5 years.

I have no idea what caused this. It was 5:00 AM, I jumped into the car, feeling really sad and alone and hoping that it'd cheer me up, drove right to the nearest McDonalds' drive-thru. I was crying, like, for 20 minutes. Then, out of nowhere, I had a thought that it'd be a great time to kill myself.  
Perhaps, a McMuffin saved my life - that shit is awesome.  

I hesitate telling anyone close to me about that. I think I'm overreacting. I _am_ overreacting. It's really irrational and stupid, and I haven't even ran of the possible options to climb out of it - like, saving some money to finally get a therapist instead of wasting it on gas and junk food. It's just a nice thought to have. I don't really contribute anything crucial to the community. I do my best to support my friends and my girlfriend in their tough times. I like to think that I'm not that bad at it. And now, when I feel I need someone of them to talk to, I just think ""nah, they won't help me anyway. What do they know about that feeling. It'd just make things worse. They could even gossip about me. They'll just dismiss it.""

It takes a lot of preparing - if I were serious to kill myself, I'd make damn sure it would be lethal. I'm too lazy to prepare.  But the McMuffins solutionâ¢ won't last long. And, being depressive (but not suicidal) for a long time makes me think that I'm becoming suicidal. I'm just curious how much time I've got left till I choose to do it.

How the hell do I say the truth to them that I'm not OK without them feeling shitty or sorry for me. "

"Just a little rant :) Warning, probably spelling mistakes but i don't care

I don't have a super hard life but sometimes what has occured gets me really fuckin down....

Long story short my mother tried to kill my dad and now i want nothing to do with her. But having one parent and no family is hard...

The problem i have been having recently is my dad is my dad and i love him but he struggles being a single parent and i am not the most helpful kid in the world.
I also don't exactly like telling people how i feel since i always feel like they are going to try and put me into therapy or some shit which won't really help in my situation. I'm also scared of making the person i tell feel bad and that i'd just be pushing my problems onto someone else.

I just really would like to know what it is like having a mum that was a mum and not some druggy for once...
We used to have so much fun together and even if she wasnt a good person i enjoyed her being in my life...

But now thats gone and I don't really have anyone else since my family is filled with a bunch of assholes or live in another fucking country

But thats the end of my rant i guess thanks for reading"

"i have ruined peoples lives and its time to stop  

Today I was reminded on how much I have ruined peoples lives.

When I was 13 years old I decided to play with other peoples emotions. I catfished. I lied, I played gamesâ¦ and I made older people fall for me not knowing who I really was. I came up with over the top stories, milked an illnessâ¦ lied about deaths and tragedies. All because I was afraid to be myself.

It wasnât because I needed money, or felt like I was ugly. I just simply needed an escape from my life and took it way too far. 

I lost my parents at a young age, adding that to the horrible experiences I had dealing with that grief, pushing everyone in my life away, doing drugs, drinking, breaking the law and the shame of being gayâ¦ I spiraled. This isnât an excuse to me, just the only explanation I can find within myself as to WHY I catfished.

I think I felt when I was pretending to be someone I wasnât that my life was normal and not terrible.   
I came up with lies/tragedies to avoid meeting people, not to get attention. I was getting enough attention just being a charming, âgenuineâ individual to those I catfished.

They fell for me, and in returnâ¦ I fell hard for them as well. 

Even though I sit here and I try to tell myself I didnât intentionally mean to hurt them or emotionally abuse themâ¦ I knew deep down there was no other ending to what I was doing. 

I didnât grieve properly when my parents were taken away from meâ¦ and I didnât have the correct support to help me get through it or be an adult. 

I am not even 18 and I realize that I have literally flushed my life down the toilet all on my own. 

I never took money from anyone, or scammed them in any way financially. In fact, I even gave most of my money away to them to try and make up for some of the hurt I caused. We all know money doesnât buy happiness or take away emotional pain, but I didnât have anything else to do. I wanted to help in some way. But I couldn't help. There's no way to fix things.

I am sitting here, after losing another person in my life to deathâ¦ realizing I have no one and I only have myself to blame.

The last thing I want to do is ruin someone elses life. 

I need to end it, and I need to end it now.

I have said this before, and even though I meant it when I saidâ¦ I changed my mind. I am scared about what will happen to me after I take my final breatheâ¦

I really donât want to dieâ¦ I want to be able to be happy, and smile and see me bring someone elses life up instead of down. I want to see the world, help othersâ¦ make my parents proud wherever they areâ¦ and I wish I was deserving of this.

But after all the pain I have caused I realize the only way for me to pay for what I did is to make it so I canât experience anything happy. I donât deserve it. I can't deserve it when I have taken happiness away from others to fulfill whatever fucking fantasy I had or to help me grieve. I was selfish and I need to make it right.

Maybe with my death, itâll help them move onâ¦ knowing I will never be able to hurt them, or anyone else again. Cause they are the ones who deserve happiness. Not me."

Why do parents feel like punishing our two days of break will help us focus on school? I can not possibly fathom how it helps us. I simply feel more pissed then and dont want to focus on school. I just got my free time taken away for three weekends because I missed one assignment in a class I have a 98 in. Just looking for some reassurance and help.
I wish I couldI wish I could kill myself right now. I really do. But Iâm trying my hardest to wait until I find a therapist so I could attempt to get better. But things arenât looking good at all. Suicide seems great for me. I donât wanna deal with this anymore. I wish I could just get away. Forever. I could risk putting myself in the hospital once again this time through a suicide attempt. There is so much stuff that I wouldnât be going through now if I wouldâve just went through with both of my attempts earlier this year.

"Hi childhood friend if you are on Reddit Hey, childhood friend if you are reading this.

I havenât seen you around in a while. We hung out all the time when we were little until we had a fight, and never played again. I was friends with your little sister after that, and you always tormented me when I was playing at your house. Once your sister told me that you were writing me a love letter, and I was so happy, I had a crush on you for a while. Eventually she told me that you had gotten over me, and to this day I donât know if she was lying or telling the truth about you having a crush, me and her have drifted away now, so I donât get to see you anymore, even though we live next door. I heard gossip around the neighborhood, that there was some family drama, and now I hear that your family is doing something in your garage like a store or something? All I am saying is that Iâve missed you and I guess I still have a crush on you a bit. I hope your ok."

For over 7 years, I've had depression. I also have anxiety and social anxiety.
I'm also introvert and spend a lot of time alone but geez that eats me alive at times because my mind doesn't shut up.
Yesterday I was also blocked by a person who I love and who loved me, at least that's what she told me. I'm left with thoughts ""What did I do wrong? Did she lie about everything?"" Etc. questions and replying what we talked about in my head and it's driving me crazy. I know I'm not perfect and often times I'm difficult but this makes me feel like, I'll never be enough for anyone to stay in my life. I just push everyone away because of my problems.
Lately I've been thinking about life a lot, how we were born to do this and that. How nothing makes me happy and how everyday feels the same. Waking up to this miserable world, trying to distract yourself and then trying to get some sleep and doing the same thing all over.
I wish there was a pill to swallow and your life would be over. I've never enjoyed living, it feels like a huge task and being forced to. 
I've been thinking of jumping off a bridge, because I don't have motivation to make it less shittier. I'm super lost and feel worthless. The only thing what keeps me from killing myself if my mother, I don't want to cause her pain."

"It honestly depresses me so much knowing I'll never leave earth.It really just irks me that of all the times I could be born, I happened to be born too early to go places other than Earth. I know a lot of you will say that Earth has many beauties and all that, but I'm not interested in that stuff unfortunately. I really wish I had been born farther into the future. I know if I worked hard enough I could possibly become an astronaut and maybe go to the ISS, but even that feels like I'm still to locked to Earth because of how it orbits Earth so closely. I feel like I'm not from here. I feel a connection to Sedna, an outer dwarf planet that orbits the sun highly elliptically, and at times is really really isolated and far out from its planet Friends and at other times is really close to them. I guess that's how I feel socially. I've considered killing myself because maybe in the afterlife you can spectate everything that happens in the universe, and I'd like to get there faster. Anyways thanks for listening to what I know is an unusual post here. "

"Is this it? Is this my life? It seems like Iâm just a waste. I wasnât made for this worldHello everyone, Iâve realized the severity of my life right now. They say loneliness is as lethal as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. I think theyâre absolutely right, nobody I know knows how much Iâm suffering right now.

Iâm 18 but I feel like the rest of my life is already set in stone for me. I donât know if I want to live the next 40 years of my life (even if it is 40, maybe less) alone. I think that there is nothing left to live for anymore. Whatâs the point of going to college and getting a job if Iâm missing relationships? 

Iâve tried meetup for friends, tinder for girlfriends, nothing has happened. Iâve tried clubs and activities. Iâm just so unrelatable, no one approaches me, Iâm shy and Iâm scared to talk to new people. 

I think two people are born in this world, winners and losers. Iâm in the second category. This place wasnât made for me and I think I should leave."
"I want to end my life.I want to end my life. I don't know how to do it as I've never attempted, but I've had thoughts and I've come to the conclusion that I now want to make this a reality. I've never self harmed and I've never made plans. I can't do this life thing, it's just not worth it anymore.

I need help for quick ways to do it. Pain is not a factor I am worried about.

I've struggled with social acceptance, bullying, a dysfunctional family in addition to very few friends - even fewer who understand and accept what I'm going through in my life. I was diagnosed 4 years ago with Major Depressive Disorder and Social Anxiety and despite my own and others attempts to counteract their effects these conditions prevent me from functioning in society.

A year ago my dad died suddenly, and everything took a turn for the worst.
Just two weeks ago I was kicked out of home. I've never been able to find my feet.
People say I don't try hard enough, or I'm looking at situations wrong. I try as hard as I can handle. I may be looking at a situation 'wrong' in others opinions but for someone like me I can't see it any other way. If there's a bad situation I cannot forsee positives coming from it.

I'm so tired of trying to explain myself to people who question why I can't do things like a 'normal' person. I'm tired of arguing that when I don't want to do something I mean it. I'm tired of my heart being broken by people I thought I could trust but drag me through thorn bushes. I'm especially tired of the lack of respect in this world for peoples views.

I hate my life and I hate this world. I don't want to be here anymore. I don't care who I hurt, because finally they may understand the hurt that I've been through. I don't feel welcome here and nothing feels right.

I've always been told that suicide is not the way. But what if there's no other way out? A friend said I was being selfish for wanting to commit suicide... it's wrong to say that to someone because it usually makes them feel bad. But it made me feel angry and more compelled to die.

I have a guinea pig. He has probably a maximum of 3 years left in his innocent little life. If he dies before I do I will be even more alone than I am now. If I die before he does, he will surely die if I don't find somewhere for him to go.

If I am successful in my attempt and this post is found by anyone I know, I leave all of my belongings to my friend Petra, and thank her for doing her best when no one else would. Unfortunately my dear, there's only so much you can do, and you won't always be there for me... and that's what I need."

And she was being really supportive and encouraged me to do it, so this Friday I decided to do it, and almost everyone was being really supportive and really nice about it, and I felt really good about myself, and I was genuinely happy :)"
Hello lads Does anybody wanna play a game or some shit as it's fucking half 5 again and I make horrible decisions
"At a loss, overwhelmedI don't even know where to start. I definitely don't know where to start without sounding like a whiny bitch. 

To start, I'm mid 20s, male, dad to 4 kids. Married. Unemployed. Major anxiety, don't know how to handle myself anymore.

To begin, I love my kids to death. I don't feel equipped to deal with them.
I love my wife, I don't feel equipped to deal with her.

I wish I had a job, nobody answers back. 4 months, no money, Christmas coming up, I'm getting impatient. 

My last job was at a liquor store. Nothing fancy. Lost that due to a few reasons. Drinking, being on my Ativan at work hard, just to ease the anxiety a little bit.

God knows I haven't been the best husband. Don't blame her for being like this to me. I've never offered stability, or anything that would make me a good husband.

Never been a drug addict or a big drinker until recently. The anxiety just got too much to bear. I don't do Street drugs. No tar, no crystal, nothing like that. 
Just went and saw a doctor for the first time in years. He has put me on so many different prescriptions in the last year to balance me out, nothing works. He finally got me on Ativan, it doesn't work but it's better than the other 7 things I've been on.

Was incarcerated for a while in my younger days. They tried a lot of therapy, prescriptions, all that. Nothing worked.

I dunno.

My wife works a graveyard shift. Comes home at 7am. Sleeps until 4. Gets up, goes back to take a nap at 9. I do everything. Not to mention I don't sleep, I never do. An hour here and there.

I've told her so many times, I need some help with the kids, they've been screaming at me for days, i need help cleaning, ect, she gets mad at me, blames me. 

I'm just at my wit's end. The last month ive had constant chest pains, my stomach has been burning. I can't see the doc for a while until I pay him for a no call no show appointment. 
Probably just stress. 

Fuck this isn't even close to everything but I guess that's all I have to say.

Thanks"

"Alright, I don't support underage drinking, but I know it's rampant at least in the U.S. so I'm here to make a quick PSA about safe drinking habits!  

1. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not rail drinks, your body can only process so much alcohol, and that equals out to roughly (per type, not total) 12 fl oz. of beer (closer to 8 if it's from a local brewery), 8 fl oz. of wine, or ***at the very most*** two shots per hour. any more than this can cause you to lose feeling and result in severe injury or death (not directly, but not being able to feel pain doesn't help impaired judgment or avoiding danger). 
2. For beer or wine, try to drink the same amount of water as alcohol at a minimum, and with shots, at the very least, 4 times as much water, as this helps to dilute and re-hydrate the body, it also helps to prevent horrible hangovers the morning after. 
3. If a friend is drinking heavily, stay with them, it may seem OK to leave them with a blanket and pillow next to a toilet, but this can and has turned out very poorly for countless people, often resulting in permanent brain damage due to oxygen deprivation due to choking on their own vomit, or from seizures caused by the alcohol (you donât need to have a history of seizures to have one while drinking), so stay with them, even if you donât want to, or make sure that they have someone to check on them every few minutes.
4. Drink as little as possible, period end of story, drinking as much as possible may seem cool, but it just turns you into a belligerent dumbass, donât do it.

Stay safe peeps, and please, make good decisions

Need reasons to not kill myself.I planned on killing myself yesterday but didnât go through with it. Iâm going to try again today. I wonât lie and say I donât want to get help but my family simply canât afford it. We already owe ten grand from the last time I was hospitalized. I donât want to make it twenty. Iâm in so much pain from cutting my thighs up and I just donât have the energy to keep living. I tried talking to my therapist but he basically just told me to go for a walk. So maybe this will help me. I dont know if itâll stop me altogether but maybe itâll help me last another day. Sorry for posting two days in a row. I have no one to turn to.

"severe tinnitus and hyperacusis, and why i probably won't make it another year.my name is matt.  i'm 24 years old.  this year in September i started experiencing a painful, sound reactive spasm in my left ear.  this spasm happened every time i spoke and every time i heard high frequency noises.  the pain was like a hot dagger in my ear.  on a scale of 1 to 10, the pain was an 8.

at the beginning of October i noticed how loud the world was becoming.  doors closing (not even slamming) started sounding like gun shots.  a dog barking was enough to make me drop to the floor in pain.  i had to stop working.

throughout October my ears started to ring.  throughout November, that ringing got louder.  throughout December, it got even louder.  it currently sounds like a dentists drill combined with microphone feedback.  it is the loudest, most shrill sound i hear in any environment.  this is 24/7.  it's like a cruel joke.

my life has absolutely collapsed as a result of this.  i live with my parents.  i'm on medical EI that will soon run out.  i can't work.  i can't socialize.  my mind has turned into mush.  i feel disconnected from reality.  i can barely communicate anymore.  there is no help.  doctors don't know dick about any of this.  i absolutely cannot take the noises in my head anymore, let alone the sensitivity i have to normal situations.  this life is lonely, boring, and pathetic.

i'm done.  that's it.  can't do it anymore."

"A life of suffering ahead.
In just under a year, I have gone from a high functioning person with a job and a full life to a person who has: two suicide attempts in one month, abuse-related trauma from reckless sexual behavior, a restraining order pressed against her, an arrest/a year of mental health jail diversion, and many destroyed relationships. I started becoming very ill right when I turned 24 and have been diagnosed with BPD. 

Iâm in so much pain and donât know how to rebuild my life. I am starting a DBT-certified program on Monday, but it is only for 10 weeks, and there are very few options for treatment afterward. Only 11 residential hospitals in this country can effectively treat BPD, and many of them are self-pay. 

I want to die, but my family loves me so much. It breaks my heart to think about how much sadness and grief they would have to go through if I were to end my life. It is so hard for them to see me completely dependent and debilitated with no idea how to help me in a way that will last long-term. 

My fear is that I will be in and out of hospitals for the rest of my life. Iâve started researching the best ways to end my life. Iâm tired of being in constant agony."

"When someone is your everything, and they leave, you have nothingHow do I get attached so fucking quickly? I don't get it. We were just friends. 4 months, 4 months of fun and confusion. It was a rollercoaster of emotion. And now its crashed into a ditch. And now i feel shattered, like ive been shot 10 times. I was at a really low point in my life before i met her. and she pulled me out.   


How did this begin? I messaged her 4 months ago, we started talking, and hungout a few times. We got so close so quickly. We called everyday for hours. And then the confusion and guilt starts. We decide to take a break indefinitely. It only lasts a day. We start talking again, for a week. Then we decide another break for 2 weeks. I only last a few days. The suicidal and insecure side of me messages her and asks ""would you care if i died?"" and she says of course. then she feels guilty for talking and says talking again would make her feel really guilty. From that point on i new this friendship or whatever the fuck you want to call it. Was doomed. I was right. This morning she asks if we could block eachother for a while. and now i'm here, in my bed trying to hold back tears. She was my everything. and now she's gone. And i hate myself, for letting myself think i should open up. That was what fucked everything. I swear to god i love her. But i don't know. I have never felt like this in my life. I feel torn and broken. One side of me knows its best for her. The other side is crying and wanting her back. I never wanted it to end. I kept a little bit of hope thinking it would work out. I would give anything to talk to her again. I need to let go. But i fucking can't. I hate myself for being like this. I haven't felt this low in years.  I'm gonna delete this in a day or 2 so she doesn't see this."

iâm just venting and cryingso my boyfriend broke up with me because his other boyfriend told him to I was in poly relationship and it didnât even seem like he fought to stay with me and he said that the trust between him and his other boyfriend sometimes matter more than our relationship every did and Iâve never felt so low to the point where Iâm telling my friend my last request if I do kill myself and Iâm just donât really want to go on without him
"What questions would be helpful for someone to ask you about suicide/depression?My friend lives too far away for me to be there with him and he doesn't like to just talk/rant about his challenges, he prefers to have specific questions that he can answer. So I am wondering, what questions could be useful to ask to spark conversation? I want him to feel loved and cared for. Thank you all so much, I know you are all going through a lot and I truly hope you are doing okay. "
"I have nothing leftToday my best friend and I decided we werenât friends anymore. It has been my biggest fear. She was the person who understood me more than anyone else. Or so I thought.  The last thing she said to me before blocking me was that she has only stuck around for these past few years is because she thought I would kill myself if she didnât. What kind of person does that. Or says that. Iâm not perfect by any means. I have adhd, sensitive, and have a short fuse. Thinking that she felt that way about me makes me want to fucking die. She was all I had left that was close to me and itâs just crazy that for the past couple of years she wasnât genuine. I feel so small and invisible. I feel like I canât trust anyone. I feel like Iâll never be ok. I feel like Iâll never function normally. I feel like dying. I feel like feeling nothing. Iâm never going to have people who truly like me. Iâm never going to have a relationship. Iâm never going to have kids. Itâs just me and Iâm ready to leave."
"In need of serious help.How do i tell my loved ones, friends, family and GF that i finalized my suicide note?"
"I Just Need Some Kind WordsHello. I am using a throw away account on this post because I am a coward and I have nowhere else to go. I want to kill myself. So bad. Itâs awful and I know that itâs going to hurt a lot of people if I do which is why Iâm not planning anything right now. Now, I know that makes me lower priority than some of the other people here but I hope at least someone can give me some kind words. 

I am 16 and in high school. I feel so alone and scared and so fucking depressed. I have struggled with depression for many years now and I thought I had finally recovered from self harm. I cut myself pretty deep a couple times on two occasions in the past 24 hours and I can feel myself getting worse. Iâve attempted before and I can feel myself getting to that point again. None of my friends care and I really donât want to burden my girlfriend with this. Reddit, I feel so alone and so scared and I just want this to stop. I know youâve probably read the same thing a million times and I know that I am no different from anyone. I have nowhere to turn to and I just donât want to be me anymore. I just want all of this to be over. My hips, where I cut, hurt so bad and I know I deserve it. 

I just want to feel less alone. I just need to know that someone out there cares. I know I donât deserve any of your time or energy and Iâm probably an asshole for even asking for it but Iâm so convinced at this point that I am nothing and I mean nothing to the world that this is the last place I can think to go. Iâm sorry. I hope whoever is reading this has a good day, though. I hope you have a better day than I am.

"I donât know how to get better
Hello,

Age: 18

Location: UK

Gender: male

Diagnosed with: Psychotic Depression, Anxiety

Iâm on so much medication and I donât seem to be getting better. I am getting worse. 

My medications are:

- Mirtazapine 30mg once daily at night
- Duloxitine 60mg once daily in the morning
- Quetiapine 300mg once daily at night
- Diazepam 5mg prn for panic attacks

Iâm suicidal, Iâm self harming by cutting myself, Iâm hearing my phone whispering to me again, Iâm paranoid about the police coming to arrest me, Iâm anxious to go outside, Iâm so depressed I just want to lay in bed all day and drug myself into a big sleep.

Iâm stuck between a rock and a hard place, if I tell my psychiatrist I know they will put me in an adult mental health hospital, Iâm terrified of that happening. If I donât tell anyone I will probably end up killing myself and I have mixed feelings about suicide at the moment.

Can anyone give me advice on what I can do?

Thanks for any replies."
"what does healthy mood regulation feel like? where do i download some? i'm either experiencing all my emotions like an F5 tornado tearing up my focus and churning my guts, or slamming into a wall and coming to a completely hopeless and indifferent stopI just can't take the emotional whiplash anymore. My life has been a chaotic mess for almost a decade, from mid adolescence till now, early adulthood, and I thought this past year since becoming not-homeless and moving into an apartment with my girlfriend, things would settle, but Adult Life just keeps happening and I can't keep up with everything that needs constant or immediate critical attention at risk of ending up without a roof or health insurance or food or vital medication or whatnot. 

I'm disabled and can never go anywhere and meet people, and none of my online following is very interactive so I don't have a lot of friends in total, and I just found out yesterday that one of my closest friends of several years, who told me almost a month ago that he planned on killing himself before completely ceasing to even open or read any of my messages, and who repeatedly excuses himself for not sending me a single message or coming and visiting for weeks or months at a time because he says his anxiety/depression keeps him literally asleep or unable to do anything except basic living functions without internally combusting, which I understand because I deal with days like that too, and which up until now I've made as much room for as humanly possible, has been posting actively on tumblr the *whole time*, sometimes even about all the other friends he's having over to his house and hanging out with and all the skype group chats he's a part of. 

With that on top of all the things that I just HAVE to be responsible for because I'm an Adult and I just. Have to be. I just can't do it. I just can't handle all of it all the time with no real rest because I can't sleep, getting to sleep takes hours or doesn't happen at all, I wake up in the middle of the night to be sick or have a panic attack, and I spend every second during the day that I'm not desperately just trying to calm my heart down before I just start breathing dead air and pass out (I have POTS so it's fast anyway and anxiety easily and often pushes it over 180 or 200 which is BEYOND painful and uncomfortable) worrying and stressing about everything that I haven't taken care of already, or worrying that I didn't do it right, or that somebody hates me [again] or that somebody's talking shit about me [again] or that none of it matters anyway because there could be a bomb or a car accident or a falling tree or some crazy random slim-chance disaster and my girlfriend could just die before coming home from work and I'd just have to pack up and move whatever shattered bits of me were left back in with my parents and god knows how well /that/ has gone in the past

I just can't handle it anymore and I've become so paranoid (about natural/crazy disasters, about people/being assaulted/robbed, about the environment and the economy and the fact that if someone misses the 40-mph turn into our blind apartment driveway, the corner of our apartment where I spend the most time is the first thing they will hit which *almost happened* once and only didn't because the car *broke the curb* and got a piece wedged underneath between it and the ground and then was being held up by some very small shrubs and that was a more terrifying experience than I had realized until the NEXT time I heard a very loud crash outside) and unstable and my mood can change like *that* and I can go from giggling and being affectionate and excited about the future and our future together and then either something will happen or my brain will just decide I've had enough time being happy and less than 30 seconds later I'll just be screaming, in a full rage, just barely in enough control by a fraying thread to keep myself from getting violent or destructive, or sobbing hysterically and begging to be allowed near a blade or pills or the busy road to hurt or kill myself. 

I was forced into therapy for about six years when I was a teenager and so don't really have pleasant experiences or positive ideas about the whole thing but I'm getting so fed up with myself and desperate for ANY kind of internal stability that I can count on and expect that I actually WANT to go and find someone and at least try some sort of meds, mood stabilizers or anti anxiety or something, but I'm on this awful government insurance and their website is so out of date that in calling any 10 random doctors (as I did last time I needed to find a new provider for something), only ONE was actually networked with the insurance and only because they had moved to a contracted hospital, and none of the rest had been contracted with them any time in the last TWO YEARS. 

I don't know what to do. I go from having my six bottles of medication all in hand, ready to take every single one with whatever hard alcohol we might have laying around, to being horrified at myself and desperately clinging to anything and anyone around me that I can and telling people that I'm suicidal to try and get them to do something or help or even say something, but nobody!! does!!! nobody cares or reacts or sometimes even fucking responds when I tell them in no uncertain terms, ""I want to kill myself and I'm not sure how many more times I can stop before I complete the attempt because I've made several already"". Nobody cares anyway and it's getting harder and I'm getting crazier and more manic with each high and more depressed with each low and I never agreed with my bipolar diagnosis until I realized how fucked up I am and I don't know what to do but at least if I killed myself my girlfriend could still pay rent and have a life and wouldn't have to listen to me whining all the time or pay for all my fucking weed that I need because it's the only thing that does SOMETHING for my anxiety but it's expensive as shit and she'd get over it. I know she would because other than a pretty face and a sharp tongue there's nothing about me worth keeping around and I know she only does because she feels sorry for me and because she'd feel guilty booting me out knowing i have absolutely nowhere but going back to sleeping on the literal sidewalk

i don't know what i'm asking for i guess i just wanted to post about this somewhere that cunty asshole wouldn't fucking see it and start subtumbling me about how I'M an ass for wanting to know that my friend is, y'know, alive

"Suicide mainly motivated by desire to get to Heaven?I'm mtf trans, 21 years old (taken hrt for a few years,) have had two major counts of unrequited love, have been depressed about unattractiveness and infertility, and have been suicidal the past few months or so. I've taken on a rigorous routine of an hour each of aerobic exercise and meditation each day ([MAP training](http://www.iqmindware.com/map-training), as it's known in combination)

The result is that I've been able to almost completely numb the feelings of depression and even the thoughts of low self-esteem but there's little to no change in suicidality from this.

Thing is, I fact checked ""suicide is a sin"" and the Bible says nothing about it being a sin (and even if it was, sins can be forgiven through faith in Christ.)

I was an atheist most of my life, but I became a Christian a few months ago. I suspect my brain did that to cope with my life having fallen apart around the same time, and thought that the maximal chance of attaining its goals (becoming fully biologically female, getting to be with the guy I loved who rejected me, being able to reproduce) would be to get to Heaven (even if it's only a 1% probability of being valid, there's still no version of subjective experience where I failed and go ""ah shit."" The only remotely possible experience following death would be paradise.)

Anyway, MAP training has been effective enough that a lot of the time I feel happy and excited enough about life to want to live. Thing is every time I decide to, my mind goes ""but wait, can't we just go to paradise in a few months rather than waiting decades for transhumanist technology?""

One main reason to go on living is that as a transhumanist and singularitarian, I believe that in the future technology will come out which will enable me to fully replace my body and thus attain my goals anyway. Also through a simulation/mind-uploading, I could attain the extra stuff I'd get in Heaven (getting to see my dead mother again, getting to be with my unrequited love.)

Plus, I kind of prefer the challenge and even if I failed or the tech didn't develop, Heaven still exists as a fallback. Obviously the probability of succeeding is highest if I don't commit suicide.

But my time preference kind of goes like ""yes, that's all true and it would be more fulfilling to attain all this through hard work, but we could narrow possible future experience to paradise in just a few months by planning out an effective suicide.""

I don't even know how to argue with that, I mean it's true after all. Unlike with most things, there would be no experience of failure.

Would it help to read a lot of fiction where people pick the hard way instead of the easy way? I became a bookworm a couple years ago and I believe the couple hundred books I read helped me become wiser and more modest/humble in many ways. I don't know whether that would help with this though.

edit: I've also noticed that stimulants, particularly amphetamines but even caffeine, eliminate this desire. Plus I've had hypothyroidism in the past. Suggests low dopamine or norepinephrine might be involved. Both those facts make me think it might be a thyroid imbalance, which I will also look into. In addition, going to try and get a therapist.

edit again: just read the risk assessment guide and I'd definitely be at the higher end: I've made multiple attempts in the past, getting progressively more lethal, the last one being a few months ago where I slashed my wrists/arms to the bone and slashed my neck with broken glass from a bottle so bad that I had to get an implant to replace the lost flesh (only barely missed the vein which would have made it lethal.) Also, the last one barely affected me fear/pain wise (probably partly due to intensive meditation practice) and was much more genuinely intended. If I tried again, it would definitely be shotgun to the head or asphyxiation by inert gas.

In addition, feeling the burden thing and loneliness/isolation."

"Heavily considering suicide, as it would probably benefit me and those around me as well.OK, this is gonna be a fairly long post full of venting/ranting so I'm sorry if you feel like I'm wasting your time. Depending on the length I may add a tl;dr at the end.  

To begin, here is some brief back story:  

I'm 20 years old, turning 21 in mid-June. I was born to teenage parents who split when I was very young (3~ish). My father is the one who took custody of me, so I haven't met my birth mother since she left us. He eventually overcame the depression that followed after meeting my current step-mother (who I consider to be my actual mother) and her two daughters. We then became a family of 5, which expanded to 6 in 2008 with the addition of my youngest brother (who is the only biological child between the two if you exclude the daughter that my parents had to give up for adoption in 2001). My father worked hard hours as a welder to support all of us (a fact that he has used to guilt-trip me before), and has forced us to move on many different occasions over the years.  

Due to the constant moving and relative family instability in my early life, I developed Social Anxiety Disorder throughout elementary, middle school and high school. It was hard for me to make friends and even if I did, those friendships dissolved after I moved. The only time I felt truly accepted socially was in my Freshman year, when I had tons of friends and I actually managed to crawl out of my shell. But when I was forced to move again, I essentially gave up on making friends, as they would just be stripped away when I was inevitably forced to move again.  

As for my relationship life, that is virtually non-existent. I have never had a girlfriend or been involved intimately with anyone. I have tried in the past and have been rejected/shunned by every girl that I try to ask out. The one that broke me and sparked a depression that I'm still in today happened in my Junior year when I asked out my best friend at the time. She and her brother were my only real friends at that point, but once I attempted to start a relationship with her, she rejected me, stating that she wasn't ready for a relationship (Which was bullshit since she got with some other jackass not even a month later.) Her brother claimed that it was because she didn't want to ruin the friendships, but that too was bullshit considering she stopped talking to me after she got with the other dude.  

Then I cut them both off after I moved again and finished my Senior year at a new school, completely broken and alone. I managed to get into a college on the opposite side of the state from my hometown (which is where the drama with that girl happened), but was only able to afford going using Student Loans.  

And that brings me to the present, and why I'm posting here. After two years of college, I have flunked out due to my depression overwhelming me and consuming me. I am completely alone after my parents essentially disowned me after finding out they have to pay over $20,000 in PLUS loans because I failed school, not to mention I have $10,000 in loans to my name. At this point, I'm on the verge of being homeless because I cannot find a job (trust me I've been trying for a while now) and even if I did have one, I would never be able to afford to pay back the money working a minimum wage job.  

But if I was to die, (my loans being federal not private), my family (which I oddly still care about somewhat) would be able to death discharge the loans and not have to worry about them.  

So my plan at the moment is to wait until I turn 21 (June 12th), to buy alcohol (which should enhance my depression to give me the stomach to go through with it), then hang myself once I am drunk out of my mind.  

To be honest, all I've ever wanted out of life was to find love, but at this point, that's not really possible.


Anyway, TL;DR:

Have Social Anxiety Disorder, depression. Flunked out of college with $30,000 in loans that would go away with suicide.

"My girlfriend broke up with me then tried to kill herselfMy girlfriend has had many problems in the past concerning her mental health and has attempted suicide many times before. However recently it has gotten worse we had an argument the day before where she claimed that all she wanted to do was hurt people and she didn't want to hurt me so she blocked almost all forms of communication I have with her however I convinced her how much she meant to me and i think she stopped and I diffused the argument. The next day she said some bullshit excuse and broke up with me and pleaded that I shouldn't do anything stupid as I have had mental health issues in the past aswell. I was pissed of but I didn't realise it so I acted very passive aggressive which I regret so much. Later on that day she tried to kill herself with a knife. However now she is in hospital receving treatment for depression which is always good.

I can't help but think that I almost killed somebody and if me being insensitive and not telling her to do anything stupid and checking up on her was this my fault?"
I love how my mom's like I'll use the pronouns you asked me to use and then never fucking uses them So I told my mom to use he/him pronouns when talking to me or about me and she said yeah that's ok I'll do that but she really doesn't. Just like why
"Venting about 2020 Well, I will vent to the people here, since I can't to my mom or friends.

January started my anxiety of World War Three potential. February brought the death of my grandmother who had raised me until I was right. March brought school closing die to covid. April had the forgotten killer wasp madness. My mom, sis, bro, and I moved into our own home in May which was pretty nice. June gave me the anxiety of now being 13 and having to live up to the given standards of being the oldest sibling and a teen. July gave back to school anxiety. August was the month school was back and I was online due to my mom's decision to do virtual. September brought the suffering of my ""step sister's"" suicide attempt. (She's 17 and her reason for the attempt is a whole other story) October brought me failing the first nine weeks, but fortunately going back to in person school. And here we are at November, me still doing bad in school. 

Honestly, 2020 was bad, but my everyday problems, make me just wanna die. I could have glaucoma. I have horrible anger issues. My friend group is crumbling apart.

My biggest problem is my sister. She is just such an annoyance. She'll do little things that piss me off like hell. She'll open my door and not close it. She'll randomly bang on my door. She'll be useless when it comes to watching our baby brother and let him mess things up. She also always has to be the center of attention and always in the right. For example, if I don't help with watching our brother, and I ask her to do something that involves helping with him, she'll go, ""you never watch him."" Which although this is partly true, I can't help with him because I am often busy doing other things, such as cleaning my room, doing laundry, etc.

Yall probably get the idea, and if you have any way to help, please provide it, I'm desperate for a coping mechanism."
"Just a ramble, no threat (TW for SI)I guess I don't really know what to say. I don't feel like I can trust myself not to hurt myself tonight. Earlier I cut a big gash in my thigh but managed to steri strip it closed. At the time, I felt slightly sick at myself for doing it but glad I resisted doing it on my arm. Now that I know I can close it OK, I feel like I'm more attracted to the idea of cutting open my wrist. I don't know if it's synonymous with wanting to kill myself, even though I've been having some pretty bleak suicidal thoughts. I said goodbye to some friends today without them realizing. At the very least, I want to cut myself open and dig deep until I find something that doesn't repulse me. Or just bleed out all the bad things in me. That obviously isn't sensible. I don't even think I want to talk to anyone because I get so tired talking about what's wrong, because there just is no way to fix any of it. I guess I just wanted someone to know. Sorry, r/SW.

**ETA:** Actually, if you happen to read this, it'd be great to at least hear from someone. As the night progresses, I seem to be feeling worse."

"So me and my gf are in long distance Me and my gf are in long distance, about 10000 miles. Today she messaged me saying that something had come up and she couldn't text me for a whole week, and not to text her. To me this feels a bit unfair, I don't like how she just disappears for a whole week without giving me the slightest clue on what is going on. Not one detail she just says that and that's it. Im feeling a bit annoyed by this, is that reasonable? I feel like it's justified but I'm not really sure. Whenever she gets back I'm gonna talk to her about it but until then is gonna suck."
"I sad, depressed, lonely, overweight and dead from insideI just can't stay like this anymore. I hate my fat body, I don't have the confidence to talk to people which makes me isolated in a room whole day long. People stare at me in weird ways cause I'm very fat . For very long time I've talked to strangers in real life and my loneliness is killing me. I'm in financial crises and I tried to do some freelancing for more than a year and not even one paying client I ever got. I hate my laziness. I'm 20 years old with nothing worthy to live for..."

**What neither helps or make things worse:**

-""You need help, go to a professional"" (you can say it in a second time only, phrasing it like: ""I'm worried for you, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you but in the meantime you could go to a doctor, a professional or somebody more competent than me. What do you think about it?"") 

-""Stay strong""


**What to say (must be an every day thing or almost):**

-""How are you doing today?"" (keep them busy and make them not to think of their depression and suicidal thoughts) 

-""Is there anything I can do for you?"" 

-""I'm here if you wanna talk"" 

-""Can I ask you why are you depressed?"" - ""Wanna talk about it?"" 

-""Are you thinking about ending your life?"" if they say yes, ask ""Do you have a plan for how you would do it?"" if they say yes again, ask ""Have you thought about when you would end your life?"" 

This makes you understand what type and how inmediate support the person you're talking to needs. Don't forget to focus on the ""why"" more than the ""how"" though.

"I really want to diemy boyfriend has brain cancer and he told me he isnt likely to survive. weve both have had terrible lives and then we found eachother and made eachother happy and we bring out the bestin eachother and now this. I don't have any close friends and the one friend I did have, got a girlfriend that doesn't like me so hes avoiding me. My family is abusive. I have no support and I feel so alone. I can't stop crying, I can't beleive this has happened to my boyfriend. We are so young and we want to be together and this is happening. I don't know what to do, I don't know how to deal except cry. Sometimes i feel likethe only reason why i cant kill myself is because my boyfriend would be disapointed if I killed myself but it just hurts and I don't know what to do. I really just want to die."
"Choosing death was the most peaceful calm I've felt in yearsYou know that overwhelming panic when you feel like you're drowning, like you're going to die and you give your everything to fight it off? Last night I gave in and just let myself sink into the hole.  

For years voices have been telling me they'll kill me in my sleep and I won't wake up. I've reached a point where that's exactly what I want. I wrote a goodbye note, lay down and waited. I was relaxed for the first time in a long time. Felt a weird calm and thought I'm ready, just kill me. I really thought I could die by letting voices or telling my brain to. I was hoping my brain would switch off or my heart would just stop. Nothing. No voices, first radio silence I've had in years. After years of hearing how they would kill me, there was nothing.  

I woke up today and everything was back, worry, noise, constant talking. Wanting to die was the most calm and peaceful night I've had in years, that's scary and I don't know what to think.  

Unsure whether this is the right place to post but just wanted to let the feels out."

Is it possible to convince the mods of r/teenagers to add a satire flair ? I believe itâll end up being really helpful/useful and it should really be considered. I know the meme flair already exists but it doesnât give the same effect as the satire flair would. Itâll also clear up any confusion of whether the person is serious or not. If any mod reads this please thing about it
"Pretty much the only thing that 2020 didnât have that much of were mass shootings [And it looks like it decided to change that right now](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1252380)

"Iâm going to kill myself...First let me introduce myself, Im 13 and struggling through life. I have no father but a mother. Before you say I shouldnât hate my life this early, let me give you a preview. The first 5 years of my life were good, raised in a house with my mom and grandma and everything was promising. Except my Grandma smoked. She smoked a pack a day and eventually got lung disease. She had to carry around oxygen tanks to breathe. It was scary for me then. Around 2013 in October, my Grandma died. I still remember it in detail:

   I was in the kitchen trying to reach the top shelf of the fridge(I was short) and kept yelling for my mom, I looked around the house for her, no sight of her. I walked into my grandmas bedroom and saw her lying on the floor gasping and trying to say help but barely able to. I screamed for my mom, after a few seconds she came in and saw my grandma laying on the ground gasping. She grabbed the house phone and called 9-1-1. I was freaking out to much to help. I could have saved her. There were ways if I just thought of them, I could have helped her. I failed.

A few days after that we went into the hospital with clarification that she died. My uncles came to the hospital too. They showed us her dead body. I tried to hold back tears thinking I could be tough. One of my uncles pat my shoulder and said âitâs okay to cry, itâs okay to cry.â I bawled. It was fault. 

    After we found my grandmas will, it said to sell the house and split the money 4 ways to my mom and uncles. My mom got my grandmas car from the will as well. My mom had no place to go. With the 50,000 she got, she rented a apartment and became a hoarder. I became conflicted. We got a bug infestation because of the hoarding. Time after time again we got kicked out for bugs and hoarding til we werenât allowed to rent a apartment. We rented hotels again and again getting kicked out. During that time my mom lost 40,000 dollars due to a scam for an airfare to Hawaii. Another event that took place was when social security knocked on the door and took me to a place called Orangewood. There I was not allowed to see my mom until she cleaned up the apartment. I was at Orangewood for a year. Near the end, I was molested while I was sleeping by a gay child. I wish to not talk about that in the comment section. 
After I was free from Orangewood, my mom starting hoarding in the car. When we got kicked out of this last apartment, I lived in the car. From one of the employees of the hotel, we got a dog for free. Another thing to add onto the list of problems. My mom finally got a job at a grocery and process a half a year, found someone at her job to be roommates with. She was a abusive roommate. Not to my mother, but to me. She said that since she was older than me, she had dominance and was practicing her rights when she beat me. We lived like this for a year until the roommate got fired from the grocery store and found a job. It was a grocery delivery job. She made me work it 12 hours a day with her no matter what. If I ever voiced my opinion, I got beat. I started getting depressed and got addicted to vodka and gin that I shoplifted. Any time she wanted to see something in any way she wants, she will. My mom got fired from the grocery store too for stealing. She waited half a year to get another job. Once she got it, I barely ever saw her. My roommate kept saying how much my mom hated me because of how much a terrible person I am. I wanted to kill myself. I still do.

I need someone to talk to. And donât say, just report the roommate. If I do then I live on the streets and I get taken from my mom. Please."

The pressure is pushing me toward the edgeThere is so much pressure on me. So much darkness happening in the world. Iâm overwhelmed. Constantly feeling anxious. Depressed. Broken. I donât know what to do. I donât know anymore. Nothing I do has been right. I donât belong on this Earth anymore. I genuinely feel like everyone elseâs life would be better without me. I donât want to live anymore. Living is exhausting. Iâm exhausted. Absolutely exhausted.
"My five month old suicide noteIâm 18 and not once have I felt fucking normal on this earth. Never fitted in, always left out. My friends arenât my friends. All I am is a punching bag to them. I have no friends, no relationships besides my nanny. All I think about is not being here. What if I wasnât? All I am is a burden to everyone.

My exam results have only gone down over the years and Iâve failed this years without even getting the results. Iâm already repeating a year. A repeat fucking dropout? Would you be proud of me if I was your son ? Iâm not an academic person and Iâve explained this to my parents but they donât listen, both graduates from university, sister currently at uni. All they know is education education education. ITS NOT ME 

My dad hounds me and hounds me. Iâve stopped playing sports and he fucking hates me for
It. I can tell heâs disappointed, I can see it. All I do is fucking work. Shop 4 times a week and working in the bar till 2 am on minimum wage. I canât take it anymore, I canât. I lie in bed constantly exhausted. No more gym, nothing. I hate myself for forgetting about the gym. I have the body of a 14 year old girl as Iâve been told by my âfriendsâ.

Iâve had suicidal thoughts since I was 14. Fantasying about Cutting myself and ending it. These were just thoughts. But around October 2018 I met a girl while working in the bar. I hadnât seen her in around a year and she transformed into the most beautiful girl I had ever seen, perfection. I got that special feeling as soon as I saw her at the bar. Her eyes were so big , so pure and so blue with her shoulder cut hair and edgy/unique style. I used to work with her best friend so she got me talking to her. I donât if itâs possible to fall In love with someone after meeting once one on one, or if itâs just obsession. For the first time ever I got that feeling and I still have it months after weâve stopped talking. She was just out of a relationship of two years and wasnât ready for anything. I hid my feelings for too long and fell in love with her. We were exclusive but she would go out and get with someone; actually the same person multiple times + her ex boyfriend at the same time , and me. I couldnât let go of her. She was and still is  my everything. Constant fall outs and fights and not being âready for a relationship â led to her going  on a date with her ex ex boyfriend and didnât tell me. I couldnât take the up and down swings of us anymore. 1 month later theyâre in a relationship. Iâve never gotten over you E, I would do anything to hold you in my arms again, to have a cigarette, to hear your laugh , your voice; you. The things you say and the way you say them but why ? Why would u do that to me ? I wouldâve done anything for you, I gave my everything but it still wasnât enough. Thanks for the good memories that we had, Iâll take them with me wherever I go.

This is fully my decision. Mum  you did try. You tried to understand what was going on and Iâll always be thankful for that. Dad thereâs a lot more to life than money. Happiness or being content is all I ever wanted. H you were a good sister, you always looked out for me, in your own bitchy way but you can achieve anything you can put your mind to. Iâve never belonged anywhere. Iâm not suppose to be here and Iâve reliased that and accepting it. The only person I genuinely like is my nanny but she has heavy dementia and a severe heart problem. I hope your number of days left greatly exceed mine. You are an amazing woman and that will never been forgotten. 

Iâm sorry. 

Iâm sorry. 

Iâm sorry.

ðððð: I planned to end everything on the 1st of June after my exams had finished. On the 30th of May my mum told me I had a doctors appointment that day. I decided why not? I was put on 30 mg mitrazaphine for around 5 months. I reconnected with an old friend over the summer and have been best friends since. His best friends become my best friends. I finally felt like I belonged in a group a people. We all liked rap, fashion and being weird + ourselves; stuff people where Iâm from arenât into. That summer has been the best of my life.  I went to concerts +raves and starting smoking weed and took mdma a few times  and some of my best memories are due to drugs. If used properly they really can be life changing. Without school I couldnât become a nurse, my dream job. I quit both of my terrible jobs and went for a job that will lead me to nursing within two years. And I got it, first time being fully independent and I couldnât be in a better position if I planned. I have MY friends, MY career and my own control of my Happiness. Iâve stopped my medication with the doctors approval and Iâve never felt better. 

Give life that chance. Please,
Thanks for reading

"I Need A Friend.I'm 21 and severely depressed. I keep staying up for days at a time because of my anxiety. I don't have a happy life. I honestly don't even want to live. My viewpoint on my own life is miserable and spirals out of control, and it accelerates the longer that I remain isolated.

I try to adopt a positive mentality, but it's nearly impossible for me. I've tried to be nice and make friends. I just can't. I feel like everyone hates me. People are just repelled away for me because I just have such a negative aura about me. For the longest time, I've felt I have had no chance at living any sort of happy life... and the longer that I live the stronger that feeling becomes.

All my insecurities, anxiety, stress issues become more solidified the longer I live, and the less and less hope I have. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm not interested in hearing about doctors or medication or therapy. I just want a friend. Someone that actually wants to spend time with me for who I am. That's all. And I can't even do that. Pretty pathetic. "

"I'm confused as to why I haven't done it yetI have all the reasons to do it; and I have no reasons to live. I kill myself in my head, in every viable method, thousands of times every day.

I'm miserable, but I don't ever execute these plans; I distract myself from reality by becoming Nietzsche's last man, seeking nothing but entertainment, and sleeping for 15+ hours at a time. **I then make a post like this even though nothing ever comes of it and I'm backed into the same corner soon enough.**

It's like i'm stuck in limbo, I kinda know what I need to do, yet I have no motivation whatsoever. I'm stuck, it makes me feel so fucking worthless. 


I don't know how I can get out of this place, the only way I can think of getting out is by killing myself.

Like i'm tired of fighting it's getting harder and harder to hide the real me.


My relationships with my parents is crumbling, I can hardly speak to them anymore. I can hardly speak to anyone anymore.

Im going to college, where I have a grand total of 3 friends. One of them isnât talking to me and I donât know why. The other two are best friends and one of them told me I make her depression worse when I turn to her for help. I canât talk to anyone, I have no one. Iâve never even fucking held a guys hand in all my fucking life. I donât know Iâm just kind of rambling. I just donât know what to do. Iâm so lonely, I donât feel like I have a home. Iâve tried dating a couple of times but I guess I just get too up in my own head. I just want someone to hold me while I cry. I want my old friends back from before I came out. I just feel like my life is going no where and everyone around me seems to be burdened by me. The only reason I havenât killed myself is because my best friend, the one who isnât talking to me, her dad committed suicide. I could never make her go through that again. I just donât know where to go or what to do to make life bearable.

I have a counselor through my school and I really like him. The sessions feel helpful while Iâm there but by the end of the week I feel like killing myself again. Iâm just lost. I donât see a reason. I donât know how to find a purpose. It all feels pointless. Iâm sorry I donât mean to bother anyone. Ugh I just feel like fucking exploding. Iâm sorry I know some people donât like swear words. Ugh

"End of the lineI keep trying. Every fucking day I keep trying. I get up and go to work and joke around and come home to an empty apartment. An empty, filthy apartment and every time I try to clean it up I just go back to bed. I used to have friends and a life, then I threw my back out and couldn't work for months and now I've sold everything worth any money at all just to pay bills and every time I think ""ok, this week I can afford groceries"" something else comes along. I can't even afford to go to the laundromat. I walked around town for two hours yesterday trying to find loose change in the street so I could afford the subway ride home from work. I don't know how I'm going to afford to get to work next week. I miss my friends but they don't understand how things got this bad and it's hard to explain to them so I don't bother. 

And I'm just tired of trying. There's no one to try for any more. Nobody gives a shit what I do or if I live or die. You all seem like nice people but at the end of the day you're just words on a screen. 

I have a few bottles of pills here that I got when I threw my back out. I think it'll help everybody. Someone out there needs a job, they can have mine. My apartment is in a decent neighborhood and in a convenient location so I'm sure someone else will be glad to live here. It won't be hard to clean out, I've sold everything that isn't basically trash. I'm just a waste of space anymore and I don't see any way out but this."

"My parents got me a stuffed animal for Christmas.Iâm 14, and Iâve been collecting stuffed animals for as long as I can remember. I have hundreds. For Christmas my parents got me a large cat stuffed animal. But something about this one is different. It feels comforting to be around. I canât stop hugging and cuddling it. It makes me feel a little bit better."
"My dad makes my entire life hell. So Iâve posted many times about my dad before *then would delete the posts*.
Iâd just like to talk about some stuff he has done.

Once I had thrush on my tongue. I was given these drops to put on it (theyâre disgusting). Iâve had them before so I knew what dose I was meant to have. The pharmacist gave me the wrong instructions. I knew what I was meant to take tho so it was fine. My dad got mad at me for not taking the amount I was told. My mum was working so she didnt see this happen. She also knew from last time how much I was meant to have. I think I was meant to have half a pipette. The pharmacist said 4 of them. Thatâs obv a massive difference. My dad ended up grabbing me and forcing more of them in my mouth and was getting very aggressive. He even said âsometimes I wish I could strangle youâ. When mum was on her break, dad called her and talked shit about me. Mum called the pharmacy and guess what? I was right. Dad never even apologised to me.

Another thing is that I have zero privacy. I am FTM trans (closeted cause dad is transphobic). So I have a female body. My parents donât allow me to have the bathroom door shut cause they think Iâm hiding something. Dad has walked past many times and saw me.. without clothes on and once he stared a bit too long for my liking. He didnât do it in a NSFW way.. just looked. Heâs also done many other things that make me uncomfortable. Heâs not a.. ya know. But he does just make me uncomfortable.

Heâs also mentally ab*sive.. I just hate being at this home."
"Please just skip thisI feel like there is very little point to anything that I do. I'm always met with bad luck and failure, whilst others (people around me) simply breeze through life. I know that in my 30s I should have realised this a long time ago (and indeed, I did realise this since my late teens) but I just want to rant.

Let me see.

This year, my father died. My home suffered fire damage. And now I have to help out a relative who is going through cancer (financial and daily help). 

I hardly got work (I get paid by assignment). 

In the last few weeks, I had paid about USD 130,000 towards the medical expenses of the said relative. I really need jobs. I had some offers about 2 weeks ago. None of them materialised. Not one of them.

Meanwhile, my colleagues (whom I've known for about 10 years) continue to breeze through work and life, happily. They are one family (for a number of them, literally family members, with the boss being their father/father-in-law/uncle). They get their big projects, their big wins. 

The kinder/smarter ones amongst them have learnt to stay away from me. The mean ones still brag about their success to me, or claim that they have too much work.

I should point out, for a number of these junior members (as in, junior to me be it in age or seniority here), were 'tutored' by me in the past. I helped them when they started their careers. When they were too afraid to trouble their father/father-in-law/uncle with trivial questions.

Yet, they mock me now. They think that I am a failure because I am rubbish. 

To be frank, if anyone of them really wanted to help me, they can easily pass me some of their work. Not their big projects of course, but the tidbits. Yet they don't. They well know I'm struggling but no one even considered helping me. 

I note that I have become mean, at least in my thoughts, towards the said relative. Whenever I think that I would probably use up most if not all my savings, for this relative and also for my elderly mother, I just want to quit life.  To be honest, I think my death right now would benefit them more because I do have savings - I have been very very frugal in the last 10 years. But for my duty towards my mother, to see that I am around to help her with this situation, and to be around in her old age, I have nothing to stay alive for."

"Rant--You ever just have those moments where you hate your own body. Growing up I never imagined that there could be so many ways for you to hate your own body. I hate my mind for always forgetting things that I should remember, for reacting to things badly, for making the decisions it has made, for freezing up when it should have screamed. I had my face for its lack of aesthetics, for the steady flow of tears it streams, for the way it lacks to show how i feel inside. I hate my body cause of the unattractive stomach pouch, for the way my boobs sag, for how my thighs touch one another, but I also hate it for the unwanted attention it brought, the unwanted force it brought upon me.
I hate showering because it reminds me, 
I hate seeing myself in the mirror cause that also reminds me. 
I hate touching myself cause that also reminds me. 
I hate going out for fun because that reminds me.
 I hate myself so much so that I live in this constant dread making myself go on and on despite the pain from all those reminders."

"Goodbye friendMy friend was taken off life support a couple days ago. OD on some synthetic opiates. Ever since then I've felt sick to my stomach seeing his family on facebook. I don't have any energy and just wanna quit my job and quit school. The last few years of my life have already been just real dull. The only thing keeping me going is a new girl at work who seems interested in me, but to her I'm just some normal guy she has no idea how depressed I am and I'm scared to get close to her. Imagining her finding out makes me even more scared. Imagining that there's a good chance she won't be around to cheer me up in the future because I'll inevitably ruin things is the worst of all. Without her I really don't know what would motivate me. But she is all I look forward to. Just getting to go to work, see her, and laugh together. I'm not good with relationships and don't know how to progress things without ruining the one thing that makes me happy.

I got off topic a bit I guess. These past few nights it's been especially hard to fall asleep. I keep thinking of my friend dying especially since we're so young. I keep thinking how he must have felt when it was happening. I wonder if he knew he was dying. I wonder if he knew he was in a coma on life support. I wonder if he's in a better place now.


I'm sorry I'm ranting i have no one to talk too about any of this. I really just don't know what to do with myself anymore."

"Please, someone talk me down. I've been having fantasies and I'm having a dark moment.For the past few weeks I got through the same motions of waking up, panicking over the day, crying, and just laying in bed, calming myself by thinking about how nice it'd be to just not have to worry about anything anymore. Imagining how people wouldn't be surprised, wouldn't care.

I had been missing my (not so great) ex recently, disregarding the bad and remembering the good. Of COURSE I message him out of weakness, and the first thing he brings up is a bad memory, a reminder of how he hurt me. I've been fucking destroyed by him, and he goes on living. And he casually brings up shit that tears my heart out again. And I just want to fucking die.

Help me. Please."
"What to do when you need to fill a prescription for actionable love and it's always out of stock?I have multiple invisible physical and mental illnesses and disorders that I have been diagnosed with by medical professionals and have had the majority of my life since I was a toddler. I'm currently 27. My entire family has various conditions as well. I wrote out a suicide note for the first time yesterday despite having experienced suicidal ideation very frequently. I told myself it was for the hopeful catharsis. I've reached a point where I feel like I cannot lie to myself anymore. I do not have health insurance. I do not have access to resources. I cannot work or attend school because of my challenges and am fully 100% financially dependent on my parents. 

Everyone in my family has specifically expressed that I am crazy, lying or lazy or all of the above. 

What do you do when talking to anyone does not help because what you need are words that accompany actions from those you love that you will never receive even after directly behind for them? I hold out every day hoping that they're wrong. That I'm wrong and I don't know how much more hope I can muster. I feel like I've used up my time. Comorbidity is a bitch. I reach out and come down the mountain with these big blocks of text ""I'm fucking sad and want to die,"" but there is no release. At the end of it - every single one of my problems is still staring me in the face and it's just circular. I have zero confidence in myself. I hate myself. I hate who I am. I have never felt loved unconditionally except by my pets. I have never been in a relationship where I didn't feel like I was their secret because I either wasn't good enough to be their partner or they were embarrassed of me. I'm not not the kind of person to put a bandaid on what feels like the titanic. I hate to waste time and I feel like an ultimate waste of space.

Bipolar I with near constant psychotic features despite what kind of episode I'm in. OCPD. CPTSD. OCD. Panic Disorder. Anorexia. Agoraphobia. JRA. 8 major and minor concussions. Severe insomnia. Various other symptoms and problems that have become worse since losing access to health insurance which includes frequent fainting/falling, sudden racing heartbeat and vertigo. These could be linked to the JRA, but since I have not been able to get to a rheumatologist since they became an issue - I don't know. All these things together make me feel like I've got every card stacked against me there's a big ass deck that can always be drawn from the keep me down. All of this makes me feel very alone. Very, very alone and unloved. I don't think there is any more I can do. I honestly don't even know what I hope to get from reaching out here on Reddit. I'm a lurker. I say words don't do shit for me anymore and yet here's my own to match Ninety-five Theses."
Friends don't careLiterally reached out to my friends telling them I'm thinking about killing myself tonight and they suddenly stop talking to me.... At this point why do I keep trying? It's so much easier to give up and I had so many chances tonight....
Can I Check Myself Into an Emergency Room If I Am Under 18?I'm 17 years old and have been thinking about committing suicide. I've decided against it for now but I think I need help before I end up going through with it. Would I be able to walk into a hospital without my parents and be admitted?
"Actually, maybe its not worth arguing with teenagers yall dumb and stubborn af, im not wasting my time anymore"
"I sabotaged myself academically and now I want to dieMy school work is FAR from my biggest problem right now. But it is a very immediate one because I haven't slept all night and I have class in 2 hours. I'm failing all of my classes. It's my senior year. I am weeks behind in every single one of my classes, and haven't done multiple projects and tests. I tried catching up but looking at how fucked I am, it's making me feel so discouraged and I want to give up again. The truth is I have loathed myself for years now and I feel like I've died on the inside. I used to do well in school, but now I've fell so behind partially due to numbness and partially because I just don't feel like I deserve to do well. So, I sabotaged myself. Now, I am slowly realizing if I don't graduate, I am even more fucked and it would mean I've wasted years of my mom's life, buying me school supplies and driving me to school. 

I honestly want to kill myself. I tried one or two summers ago but got scared last minute and I haven't told anyone. I am a burden in so many ways, but this is really the cherry on top. I have wanted to die since I was 12. I can't explain any of this to my teachers because then they will get my family involved and that'll be a whole fucking shit show. Another problem is I no longer can even focus on, or understand, my school work. I swear to god my brain has shrunken or something because nothing sticks anymore. It's like all I am good for is spending hours doing nothing but worrying and finding reasons to hate myself. 

I literally know the only way out of this is dying. It's all my fault. I don't know what to do. I just want to get back to my regular suffering without this on top of it at this point."

"Iâm depressed for the first time in years...now Iâm dealing with a depressed husbandIâm going to make this as short and sweet as possible: Iâve almost always been a happy positive person, but after a couple years of non-stop medical issues and surgeries, Iâve become incredibly sad and depressed. I have done my best to keep the fake happy face on for everyone except my husband...who I thought I could unload on. It seems to have backfired because now he is sad and overwhelmed. Now I give up!! I have devastated him and put a whole bunch of shit oh his shoulders, so now Iâm pretending Iâm all better when Iâm around him because I feel even more shitty and guilty. I desperately want out. I want to be done. I can only cry quietly in the bathroom or the basement. I just want to figure out a way to leave peacefully from this world. I know this sounds rambling, but I just donât feel like explaining everything....I will never go to the hospital or therapy...I was depressed/anxious once 25 years ago after a serious car accident where I nearly died and was forced into the hospital. It was an experience I promised myself I would never allow myself to repeat. I want to be happy again...but now...fuck it."

"Really wanting to die, all the timeI know I'm not the only one on here who feels this way or talks about it, but I need to air it all out before I do something stupid, I've tried several times to end it all, and nothing seems to work, 3 failed ODs and one failed hanging, one failed drowning, and cutting deep into my wrist and watching it bleed hoping it doesn't stop. Sometimes I just look around to see if I could kill myself with something around me. I'm not in a bad situation, I live in a first world country, a white male who was born into a bit of privilege, but also had two shitty, neglectful parents who had addictions and constantly fought, took me years to realize my mom was a terrible, abandoning alcoholic, and my dad couldn't force himself to properly care, and only recently got his shit together. My friends abandon me all the time, just lost 3 in the past week, got kicked out of school because they feel they can't keep me safe, and all the time I'm kept up because I feel like offing myself every minute of every day. I have two options remaining, at least options that are easily obtainable, death by my allergy, or death by OD on Tylenol, it sounded stupid at first but I was willing to try everything, so I got a bottle of extra strength Tylenol and hid it in my room, but after some googling I found out that it's an awful, slow, painful way to go. My allergy is to peanuts and all nuts, and I have some peanut butter chocolate on my bedside table that I look at, but suphocatting doesn't sound too great. Nothing is easy, or painless, or quick, especially where I live, but I want so badly to just die."

"Help needed! So, I've been at my girl's place for the first time ever, so new everything. Usually i have a great visual memory and space awareness so learning new surroundings isn't hard for me. Long story short my girlfriend is claiming that we have been on a walk during the time period of 12:15 - 13:15, and she continues to tell me all the details that I was on a swing so on (consider that this happens today while we where walking through that area where I've been supposedly been already, but i felt like I see it for the first time). It's driving me crazy that I forgot an hour or so of the day that happend 2 days ago. My solution was that if I can see my GPS history tracking in last 2 days so I can see if she's right or I'm getting  alzheimer's. Any other suggestions are welcome!"
Living for others...Is anybody ready to kill themselves but holding back because of the people that would be hurt by it?
I finally finished my noteMy lack of motivation/energy to do anything made it difficult to work on but I finally finished after about a year or two of pushing the note off. I'm not really sure if it counts as a will but I don't have much to my name either way. I'm not sure when I'm going to do it but at the very least after March 11th. I'll probably plan out on how I'm going to do it now.

"Does anyone else feel like their SO want them to die?My girlfriend is the only person I could possibly talk to about killing myself. When I'm at a low, I get unresponsive. She told me I've been making the house unstable. It's just me and her. If she's feeling like things are unstable, I guess that's on me."
"I can't take this anymoreAll I want to do now is die. I'm currently 17 and been bullied, abused and harassed by people at school and by family for about 11 or so years. I've alse been holding in my pain for about the same time and now I cannot take it anymore. I've been wanting to kill myself ever since I was back stabbed by someone I considered to be a close friend, and now its getting to the point where the thought of my death is joyful, but also scary at the same time. I don't know when I will kill myself but I hope its soon, because no one is supporting me and nothing has helped me."
So tired of living this life- I want to die as I feel suffocatedIâm so exhausted that I want out ... this life is full of misery and I just want to die ... my life story is like that of a horror movie ..... anybody help
"Theoretically as a minor: If I told my psychiatrist/therapist that I tried to commit suicide, would they have to tell my parents?I swallowed a bunch of sleeping pills last night and it didn't work. Woke up the next morning, nobody's the wiser. I'm pretty sure it'd be a good idea to tell my therapist, but I don't want my parents to know.

Also, should I be worried about any liver or health problems as a result of this?

I guess for some background, I've been suicidal or had suicidal thoughts everyday for about 5-6 years. I'm also almost 18 too. And a bad conversation led to the attempt. I don't want to get more specific, but I'm still worried I'll try again.

And, uh... To the mods, I don't know if saying something I've already done counts as talking about explicit methods... But I think it matters because I'm worried about any health problems that may arise later. If that's still a problem then I guess I can edit it out...

I send my thanks to everyone who replies"
"A song triggered me but i keep listening to itMy friend shot himself in the head in 2018. This sparked a huge curiosity into guns, bullets, and suicide by gun for me. I can read about it and not be bothered. But the song âPumped Up Kicksâ triggers the memory of my friend. It also triggers the picture of the columbine shooters dead in the library. i keep thinking of the photo and its fucking me up. i heard the song at around 4pm today, and while in the shower (around 10pm) i had a maladaptive daydream which was i think half an hour long. I just got out of another one, and this time is was around an hour long. 

My dad had to watch me like a hawk because i was talking and walking around. Iâm prone to walking into things, and even though he was watching me i ran into my bookshelf and took a chunk out of my nose. 

These thoughts of cutting and shooting myself and just giving up keep flooding my mind and i cant take it."
"Why can't you kill yourself?I have spent 10 years trying to change my life and it never, nor it ever will. I don't think I'm depressed anymore. I have just taken a very logical decision to kill myself. No matter how happy I am, this feeling of wanting to suicide never changes. Unlike the past when I could hope for a fantastic miracle, now I'm more of a realist. I know I'm doomed to live a pathetic life. And it's my choice to better be out than to live a miserable life. I'm not depressed. It's my choice. Just trying to find the right time, to come to terms with the fact that I'll be leaving my loved ones behind, and also trying to get over the fear of causing death to myself.

Why do people tell you that you must be depressed if you want to kill yourself? I'm logical and I'm a realist, I'm not depressed. So, why shouldn't I kill myself?"

"tw sh/suii want to die so fucking bad. i deserve it. i deserve a slow and painful death. but i cant kill myself because im already so much of a waste of time on my family and i cant make it worse by putting grief on them. its not like i can be any more of a bitch though. my thigh stings from cutting a lot earlier and i just wanna do it more. its what i deserve. im such a useless piece of shit and a dumbass. im so fucking stupid. i dont know how anyone likes me, if they even do anymore. i hope someone kills me."
"I'm probably not going to do it, but i feel closer to wanting to every day.The thing is, things get better, only to turn around and get worse. I'm trying to be strong for the sake of the people around me, but i can't be strong. I can't live up to what people want me to. I need friends to hang out with but everyone blows me off and fucks me over. Sometimes it feels like people do it on purpose and i hate it. I hate myself. I hate my family because they're so similar to me. I just want to be normal and well liked. Another thing is that girls never start conversations with me and i'm too much of a pussy to start conversations with them (if i don't know them already) and i really want some sort of companionship. sorry for the wall of text. I just need to get this out."

"Hereâs what I think they should have done about Covid and what they should do about schools reopening(USA not other countries) Instead of students taking a couple months off school for lockdown, why not take the full year then pick up where they left off? For example, if you were in Middle School and in the Freshman year of high school, and lockdown started on March 20, you would be in lockdown for the whole rest of the year until March 20, 2021 then resume Freshman year until summer vacation. Yes, you age one year and youâre grad year is something different and sure itâs a full year on lockdown but it would help so much with preventing COVID-19 and scheduling summer sports and extracurricular activities. The sooner we get back in schools, the more COVID cases there will be for kids and families and possibly more deaths. And schools reopening now? This is not the time we should be required to take online school or wait until next year because we will just have to take another quarantine anyway. I donât mind waiting longer or until a vaccine is out if that means that I can go to school like normal, I dont want to do any âhybrid learningâ options or full online where itâs just filling out brainless paperwork and not learning at all. Kids are still going to take masks off and that kind of thing because they donât take this thing seriously, and some of the really young kids probably have no idea or can comprehend whatâs happening."

One of my jobs is miserable but I can't quit because I have people depending on me. I'm just stuck and all I want to do is die. One of my best friends just dropped off the face of the earth which is really screwing with me. I'm just so stressed that I want to die.

Honestly itâs gotten kind of better but I still have that feeling of wanting to kill myself lots of times I still feel like a burden on everyone I talk to,everything I do in my job and in general. I just feel emotionless and anxiety ridden tbh itâs a feeling like I donât care at all something itâs just not right but I find everyday I want to kill myself and it creeps closer and closer on me I just want to find some happiness genuine happiness but I find that hard to come by."

"Save me.I have come to terms with death and no longer fear it. I accept it with open arms. Iâm not afraid of the pain or what comes after it, Iâm honestly quite curious. But the only thing to do now is run through every possible outcome. I have been having suicidal thoughts for quite a while and feel worthless. I know I will never make my parents proud. I know I always will be the screw up that I was destined to be since the day I was born. Iâve gotten to the point where it actually hurts to do anything. It feels like my mind is being ripped apart with the force of a thousand suns. I donât understand my own brain, and what humans donât understand; they fear. I throw on a mask to hide what is really there. When you talk to me, you are not talking to me. I am not me, I am trapped in a cage within that I fear; my mind. I want out; nay, I NEED out. The only thing is what happens if I fail? What would my family do? Think? Say? This wouldnât be an issue if I succeed, because Iâd be dead. And I donât have any close friends to worry about. Guess I just have to make sure I donât fail."

And still, I'm the lazy burden of the family.

And still, I'm considered the failure.

I've given it 150% of my effort, but if we lose everything despite that and I can't survive on my own, I'm ending it. It's too difficult to crawl back up from a mile deep trench. There's nowhere to go."

"so... we finally broke up if youâre active on this subreddit, youâve probably heard about my relationship problems before. I post quite a lot from my relationship, which I do regret in a sense. 

but looking back, i guess that really shows how unhealthy it was. but anyway, he broke up with me because I got mad at him when I was going on a rant about my dead father, and he said âyou know I donât like talking about thisâ when the topic of the conversation was âI feel Iâm being forced to forget him because I have nobody to talk to about itâ. 

if you had seen one of my posts in the past, you probably wouldâve looked and gone âbreak up with himâ or âwow thatâs toxicâ. 

anyways. itâs over now. yay."

"She told me she'd look after my dog once I'm gone (22F) My best friend and I went on a walk yesterday and I told her about my suicidal plan.
We sort of talked about the way I was gonna do it (She's the only one that knows I'm gonna kill myself),  and I told her that the only reason I wake up everyday is because of my dog, Milan. My parents told me that if I kill myself, they'd put him up for adoption. I don't want that for him. I wanna see him grow old, but know I won't be able to do so.
He means everything to me. A couple seconds passed, and she said ""Don't worry. If you ever kill yourself, I'll look after your dog""
Now I feel a lot better. The day I finally take that step, I'm gonna leave her and my family a letter. I hope she takes care of him when I'm gone."
"Grieving and feeling sad all the timeEvery since my dad passed away I felt like a cloud of sadness and despair came over my life. Sure I can be happy in some moments but once itâs passed and Iâm alone, Iâd feel sad and fantasize about killing myself to end the pain and join him in death.

When he was alive, I drank and partied for fun and to be happy. And now when heâs gone, even drinking and socializing do nothing for me and feel like a chore. 

This whole ordeal has drained me of my confidence and left me full of self doubt. Iâm feeling so ugly and worthless now.

Itâs been a few months now since he passed but the sadness still lingers like a shadow. I just want this sadness to go away."

I can't say I'm in physical pain, actually I can I have a caffeine head ache. I'm going back to school soon so these states of a misty minds won't happen as often as long as I lay more attention to my brain and swimming grey matter that is developing my cognition and behavior."
"HiBefore I start, I want to state that I don't feel like ending my life. Not right now. But I need to talk.

Honestly, I don't really know what to say. I just want to talk. Talk to someone that isn't of value to my life (no offense, readers). Talk to someone that has nothing at stake. I feel this way often. I think about getting a blog or a journal or even a psychologist, but none of that fits the bill that I'm trying to pay. So... here I am, typing out to reddit, without a throwaway.

I suffer depression, anxiety, and severe panic disorder. I quit smoking cigarettes by replacing it with marijuana. I quit because they smell bad (14 years long), my family judges me for it and honestly, I can't afford it anymore.

Now, I smoke weed only occasionally, and I intend to stop soon. Sometimes it relaxes me, sometimes it makes me go into a full-blown panic attack where I feel like I'm having a real heart attack. I need something to fill that cigarette gap. Lately I've been drinking a lot of coffee instead. It's not helping me sleep, and tends to leave me more prone to panic attacks.

I've lost a handful of family members and a second handful of friends to suicide. Depression and anxiety run deep in my family. The panic is more rare, and I'm quite certain no one in my family has it as badly as I do. It physically hurts. It's crippling.

I tried to swallow a mouth full of pills sometime around three years ago. It was a brash, emotional and scary moment in my life. It was scary. It was the first time I ever stood on that line. Like a flag on a calm day, waiting for the first draft to sway me one way or the other. Still, it wasn't the scariest moment I've ever been in.

Often, I feel alone and lonely. Yet, I choose to shove myself into a corner in the dark and talk to no one. I'm angry and annoyed often. I feel like the ones I love and trust the most are going to stab me in the back. I let little things ruin my whole day. I keep quiet about how I feel until I know how to convey it... but by then I've stewed over and tend to overdo it.

Done with my rant... I want to share the scariest moment I've ever dealt with. Driving down a country road, by myself. A great day. Happy. Beautiful outside, the windows down, the sun still high. The urge to pull my vehicle hard to the right and into a tree. That's what makes this so scary. It lingers and it tugs and it calls and it tears me apart. I have so many reasons to be happy and alive. Still, like a fly in the kitchen that just keeps reappearing, I get these urges. 

I'm sorry if this post was a waste of your time. I just really needed to get this off my chest without any judgment. Though, I may have ruined my anonymity with too many details. If you think you know who I am after reading this, please don't approach me about this post. Approach me like you would any other day."
"Well, I failedHey, SW. This is just a throwaway account, but I really need advice now. If you promise to not judge me, I won't judge you.

I'm a high schooler, formerly an A/B student that, although shy, did well in school. Well, the problem now is that I've been suffering from depression (it's self-diagnosed, I know, but I haven't gotten an evaluation yet) since the beginning of middle school. Constant bullying, house arguments, and just not being able to stand up for myself put me in a dark place where I would contemplate not if I should commit suicide, but what was the best way to do it. Messed up, I figure, but I'm used to it.

Anyways, starting last month, I hit rock bottom face first. Every day, I wake up wondering what shit I would have to deal with today, sludge around in school, absorb the arguments my sister and my single mother would have, dick around on the computer, and go to bed. And frankly, I can't bring myself to do anything else. If I have schoolwork, I can't bring myself to do it. If I want to do something creative like write or take pictures, I can't take the first step. If I want to start something new, my feet cease to move, and I'm stuck in the old. My brain will not let me go any further in life. I'm just stuck like this forever.

So now, I'm bombing all my classes, I'm letting what little friends I have down, and, quite frankly, I don't want to live in a world I loath. I don't believe in an afterlife, but no life is better than hell. Every day, I dread the future, whether it be the next day or my future as an adult. Both end with failures, disappointments, and uselessness. I'd rather save everyone the time and sorrow and end it quickly.

Thanks in advance."

"29F. I would appreciate having someone to talk to right now. (preferably same age or older)I'll try to sum up what's going on. Basically, I've been dealing with depression for 17 years now. Anxiety for almost 10. I've thought of killing myself almost every single day since I hit puberty. Right now, suicide seems like the best option.

I'm so tired of being alive. I work a dead end call center job, which isn't actually that bad (it pays $15/hour, which is fine for the midwest), but I have mental health issues that prevent me from going back to college and getting something better. Along with PTSD, I was also diagnosed with insomnia last year. None of the medications I'm on help the PTSD but I do have ambien for the insomnia, so that's a plus.

My best friend is currently dying from cancer. My brother, who I share an apartment with, is a manipulative shit, even though I love him. We've been working on our communication since deciding to live together (we also work and currently commute together) but apparently he's been ""saving"" lots of things up to use against me during our next disagreement. He deals with similar anxiety and depression issues and is also medicated but neither of us feel that our depression is seriously impacted by SSRIs. Any time I try to increase dosage, I start dissociating and my anxiety goes out of control.

I've almost totally given up. Tonight he and I had a fight and it helped put some things into perspective. I've been keeping myself alive for his sake, but I realized that living with me probably isn't good for him if he really dislikes me so much. Even though he claims to hate and resent our mom, the two of them seem to naturally cooperate much better than he and I do. I think he would feel less stressed and obligated to ""grow up too fast"" if he lived with her.

Right now I'm planning to commit suicide at a gun range. If possible, I'd like to talk to someone who understands and isn't going to try to come up with a hundred reasons why I shouldn't. We don't really know each other that well. But I would still appreciate having someone to talk to so I feel less alone right now."

"This is hardHi,

I donât really know where to start. I havenât slept in months. Maybe years. 

My girlfriend is supposed to come over tomorrow. Sheâs been worried about me. She wants to break the lockdown to come see me.

Iâm not sure I can make it the next couple of hours till she gets here. I cracked maybe 2 days ago. Iâve been in and out of break downs and psychotic delusions.

I donât want to be alive. Not that I donât feel like I deserve to be alive or that I feel nobody will care if I die. I just donât want to do this anymore, I donât want to wake up, and I donât want to struggle to go to sleep. 

Iâve tried so much. I was a champion athlete. I was a top academic. I tried going out and not going out at all. Drugs, sobriety, music, crying and being stoic. Trying to be better at my career. Trying to be a better person. Instruments, poetry, writing, research, analysis, helping others, helping myself be a better person. Trying to be kind, trying to be mean. Trying to reach out trying not to talk at all.

And Iâve done so much, so so much more than most people get to say theyâve done. 

I donât see why I should keep going. I feel maxed out. I donât see myself being any further in life. I donât enjoy anything. Thereâs nothing wrong with me, or my life. A bit of baggage, some messy family history. 

Iâve been alone for weeks now. The only conclusion Iâve arrived to is that I add no value to this world. I am a danger to those I love because Iâm so toxic. I donât make people happy. I donât want to keep being a wasteful source of worry for others. 

I want to die. I donât want to go out quietly. I want to fight, and claw. I want something to make me feel broken before I go. Not just life itself. Not something so simple. 

Iâve written notes or sent messages to people I love. Iâve said my final words. I feel like thereâs this darkness wrapping over my eyes. I donât even know where I am anymore. I feel like Iâm operating outside of my own body. 

All I want is one more hug from the poor girl who has dealt with me through to much. I just want to hold her one more time and then I canât go. 

Iâm so tired. Iâm so god damn tired."

Im scared, really scared. Not scared of death, but of the pain and the consequences I'll have to face if I don't actually die.

I'm kind of sad that I won't get to do all the things that I have always wanted to. I've always wanted to try sushi, to go to a WCE event, fly in a plane etc. All those little things that I won't get to experience.

I might get too scared to do it and end up not doing it, but I think I'm brave enough to go with the plan.

"Coming out of my shell sharing this stuff. Help? (Original post on /r/askreddit)Hi, my name is unimportant, and I feel as though I am too. For the last ten plus years it seems as though life has been on a downhill spiral. And as of now, every thing I do seems pointless.
I honestly don't know where to start. I'm constantly depressed, I have nothing in life to look forward to, every time I consulted someone about my issues the only advice I get is, ""You just have to wait. Everything will be better with time"". Hell, for years I've been telling myself that also. But nothing ever ends up ""getting better"". Everything always ends up worse. I mean sure, I get a pat on the back every couple of months, but that isn't enough to give me the will to live. I mean, just as I was driving home today from work I almost had to fight myself not to drive my car into the guard rails along the highway. So if this continues, what's to stop me from actually doing it tomorrow on my way to work?
I'm posting here because I'm out of options for advice. Otherwise, trust me, I wouldn't be posting here. I'm pretty much the type of person who bottles up all of their issues and problems inside. I know it's not good for me, but at least it doesn't make other people worry about me when I know their attention is needed elsewhere or if they already have enough stress on their shoulders.
I've taken medication, doesn't help. I've talking to counselors and doctors, doesn't help. I've talked to my parents and siblings, doesn't help. So please, if there is anyone who understands my issues, lend me a hand, give me some advice, anything...?"

"I need a reason to go on. I wrote this in preparation for...for when it happens...Suicide Note:
I just want to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I have an illness that just wreaks havoc on my mind and I'm too weak to keep going on. A lot of people brush it off as if I'm only seeking attention, they think I'm over exaggerating the symptoms. But this is real. I wake up every day wanting to die. I brainstorm different ways of doing it, asking myself if today is the day I finally stop hesitating. I need help but all anyone tells me is there's no one to help and to do it myself. But I can't help myself so I'm asking for help from others, what's so wrong about that? What if for once, just once, I need help? I guess it's too late though. If you're reading this then I must have finally stopped hesitating. I'm sorry I've done this but I can't go on hating myself every single day. Every thought is about my failures; and every day that goes by the list gets longer. Everytime something goes wrong my brains response is to tell myself if I was dead this wouldn't have happened. And it's right. If I was dead so many problems would vanish. I'd stop holding people back, I'd stop disappointing my parents, I'd be gone and unable to do anything more to ruin the lives of those around me. My entire existence is problematic. But...not anymore. I'll apologize a third time. But I did what I had to. I can't go on like this anymore and I did what's best for everyone. I love you."

There's only one problem left, and I don't know how to handle it.

One of my best friends is a first responder in my town and I don't want him to be there when they find me. I don't know how to tell him to stay home without telling him why... I had a thought that maybe the friend I've reached out to that doesn't actually seem to care too much if I live or die might be willing to run interference on that night for me. But I'm not sure I trust him, either.

It's hard to explain the feeling I have about this because I know I \*can't\* regret if he finds me. There won't be any me to feel regret. But I still am burdened by it. This is the torture of a damaged mind, I guess.

For now I am simply looking for advice... how do you warn off someone without tipping them off? Is it possible... and should I bother?"

"""I'm so very tired, please just sing me to sleep, sing to me... deep inside of my heart I really want to go."" I don't know what to do.Morrissey couldn't of put it better. I'm just so tired of my monotonous life, I've finished school just about to start sixth form &amp; I feel like I'm going mad, it feels like I've been having some sort of suicidal thought whether it's momentary or not every other day for the past month. 

I really hate my school &amp; am partly glad to be leaving but I just can't bring myself to start again &amp; reinvent myself for the next 2 years. I've got my school leavers dance in two weeks time &amp; I'm fucking petrified. There's a girl in my year whom I have a massive crush on, there's just something about her we'll call her ""Jane"", However when I bucked up the courage to ask Jane to prom she told people that she had no intention of going with me, yes I was angry in the way she went about it but I still ***really*** like her. 

There's another girl who we'll call ""Sarah"", we met online a few months back &amp; she's the same age, we get on really well, she's really attractive (she's got such pretty eyes) but she lives quite a few hours away from me. I don't know what to do, I don't really want another long distance relationship, my previous relationship was long distance &amp; that was a disaster.

I'm nervous about telling Jane how I really feel in case it goes in one ear &amp; out the other, like the old saying goes *""When you die your regret the things you  didn't than the things you did""*. I'm scared that within the next few days if not weeks I'll attempt suicide because I can't cope with the changes that are taking place around me. I don't know what to do.

*""I'm so very tired, please just sing me to sleep, sing to me... deep inside of my heart I really want to go.""*"
"first postI feel like im drowning and im falling deeper and deeper into my own black hole and my suicidal thoughts are coming more frequently than ever. I dont know what to do, should I just end it?"
"Well, itâs been fun, but now my parents are probably gonna kill me. So, I decided to order something kinda *risquÃ©* off the internet. Iâm not gonna say what, but needless to say Iâd get in serious trouble if it was seen. My plan was to buy with a gift card, then use delivery instructions to get it hidden on delivery until I can sneak it in. Well, turns out that delivery instructions arenât available for this package (for some reason Iâve yet to find out). This would have only been a small problem, since Iâm normally home before my dad, who collects our mail. But, because my luck is a massive bitch, the day itâs scheduled to arrive is one of the few days I have to stay late. Knowing my parents, theyâll probably wonder what I got and open it. So, itâs been fun, but bye bye! Iâll probably be dead, grounded for several years, or homeless by the end of the week."
Hey girl you a crack addict? Cuss I have a pipe you can smoke
"Tired of the everlasting fight28 male. Ive been depressed since i was 11. Always struggled with sleep ever since I could remember. For whatever reason I could never fall asleep until a few hours before i had to be awake. As an adult we worry about tomorrow. We worry about things that need to get done. We fantasize about things we want to happen. But as a 4 year old ? Idk.. i had lots of strange nightmares/dreams, out of body experiences as a kid. I had a fairly happy childhood, loving parents. I grew up on a horse farm. My grandfather was great when i was young. As soon as i was old enough to help with farm duties I quickly learned he was a different man. He would yell and degrade me if i was too slow to do a task or didnât know what tool was what. As i got older he would yell at me saying i was worthless. Whatâs gonna happen when he dies to this farm? Youâre gonna run it into the ground. How stupid can you be? My parents were never around to hear this. I would tell my parents but they would just say â he says the same to meâ I never wanted to be a farmer when i was a teen. I wanted to play with my friends n just find myself. But I would be forced to help on the farm against my will. If i was out on a Friday till 2 am with friends My mom would run in my room at 5 am panicking â grandpa needs you!! Grandpa needs you! Get up u have to help him right now!â I wouldnât even be able to eat breakfast. Id go down the barn only to learn i had to hold a flashlight. But thatâs the trick. If i ever left after my â flashlight dutyâ i would be degraded by my grandfather saying I donât care about this farm. So id be stuck helping him from 5 am till 9 pm some days.. maybe most times id be till 6 or 7.. then id hang with my â neighborhood friends â who always made fun of me. I was the shy awkward kid in the group so i was easiest to make fun of. I get friends do that. But i was seriously always the butt of the joke even by some of their parents. I always smelled like horse shit n they thought i never showered. Even if i put new clothes on I would smell like the barn. Now as an adult I have ptsd from him n my mom always freaking out. I jump from any slight noise. Not to mention my sister is a screamer . She would get into scream fest with her bf. My house was always chaotic until i was 18. When I hung with my friends I couldnât believe how peaceful things were. Sure bros n sis would fight parents would argue but it was never at an extreme level. To put my experience in perspective think of carmella n tony soprano fight in whitecaps.. that was the level of intensity i grew up with. 

Eventually my parents split when i was 17 Maybe younger. This affected me greatly. School was the worst experience ever. I was that weird kid who someone was able to fit in with any group yet i never had a best friend. Only ppl i hung out with were my neighbors nd were very different. Only friends because weâre neighbors. Theyâre more from a wealthy family too. They had so many things handed to them. I had to wash my own clothes when i was 10. They didnât start till they were in their 20s. So they couldnât relate to my home experiences. Happy parents happy home. Im glad they donât relate tho. I hope no one does. Its an awful feeling. 

Anyway im trying to give you a bigger scope of why I struggle with depression and anxiety. I donât wanna give my whole life story here but ill try n bullet point some things to shorten it up. 

: always struggled in school. Was in classes with assistant teacher for students who learned at a slower pace. 
: parents never encouraged me to get my license so i took the bus to school till graduation. Made me feel weird being on a bus with all 9th n 10th graders. 

:living with my mom alone... she had a bf down the street. She was never home.. i had no car no money n no job so I would eat crackers every night. I weighed 100 pounds. I was extremely skinny. 

: couldnât get girlfriends in school 
: after school I finally got my license, had to move in with my father got work had money n finally started meeting ppl. 
: when okcupid n tinder was new I somehow got lucky in the beginning. Id meet ppl here n there. Hook up. 
: fell really hard for my coworker. She was everything i wanted in a relationship but she had a bf. There was moments where it looked like it would end but it never happened. 
: she was hard to get over. It took years. 
: I eventually started hooking up casually for a whole decade. I mean i wanted something serious. Everyone i met up with I went in seeing if it could go somewhere else but they werenât right for me. I gave ppl chances I really didnât like just to see if my feelings would change but it never did. 
There was one girl on my snapchat that caught my attention. She intimidated me. I took my time with her so I wouldnât meet up n hook up. After 5 years we finally met. I met her friend Same night. We hit it off. Hung out the next two weeks. We cuddled the last night.  Then suddenly her friend tried hooking up with me. I was drunk n stupid. I teased the idea but I kept thinking about the girl I really wanted. Instead of telling her this I said I cant meet up tonight. Next day sheâs being weird. I confront her about the texts n said shes used to guys playing games idc if u want to hook up with my friend u can do so. 
I told her i was sry n didnât want to hook up with her. But the following week she ignored me. Eventually she told me she needed space. Sounds like it affected her a lil bit.. but months later I found out she knew her friend wanted to fuck me. She asked n said go for it. So this whole time her friend liked me as I liked the other girl. Apparently she already had other guys she wasnât sure about the whole time. Idk why this couldnât have been addressed from the beginning. After months i begged for clarity so I could move on and all she would say is â idk im confused  I donât really have time for a bf atmâ she was working two jobs every day plus had problems with her roommate.. now thatâs all cleared she doesnât want a relationship with anybody. Nd i ruined my chances because one night she deleted me n refused to tell me or talk to me for a month. Making her friend talk for us both. One night she finally agreed to hangout but instead of chilling we went to bars.. when we arrived at her house she ran upstairs n went to bed. I was pissed so i rushed out. I was waiting 3 months to kno wth was goin on n 1 month since she removed me.. i needed answers I thought i was getting them that night. To have her run upstairs n not have the decency to say â sry i feel like shit weâll talk tomorrow â it would have made me upset but at least respected. So i stormed out. Next day she yelled at me about it how i blew things out of proportion. Telling me whatever feelings were developing were gone. But she understood my pov in the end. I just donât kno why she was so juvenile about the whole thing. Ik I smothered her a lil bit but thatâs because she was being incredibly vague n unclear with everything. All she had to say from the beginning was â hey look theres a lot going on in my life right now idk if I want a relationship with anyone but my friend has a crush on you. Maybe see where that goes. Im sryâ nd boom that would have savd me months of not worrying about my worth. Did i do something wrong. Crying every night. Not sleeping. She really fucked me up. Idk what it is about this girl but i saw myself n her having a future. Yet she had to play these dumb games with me. Im giving her the benefit of the doubt she is 23 nd her best guy friend eventually told me she can be veryyy immature n not know how to handle situations but heâs trying to help her. 

: even common friendships i feel like its pulling teeth to have ppl be your friend. No one wants to do anything. I just donât relate with anyone, i fear. 
: im into music and film. I go to open mics, film events nd i find myself not relating with anyone. 
I try to squeeze my way into conversations if I actually have something to say to the topic. Sometimes it works other times ppl ignore me like im a ghost. 

I seriously feel so alone in this world. 
Im tired of always being the one chasing friends to do things. I always get â cant im busyâ â maybe tomorrow â n then i see them hanging with friends... Iâll confront them n theyâll just be like â oh we just went to get a quick drink.. oh we just needed something at the mall.â Im that weird friend who enjoys going on errands with friends. But no one wants me. 

: im sick of needing to shower every day, clip nails, dry off, wash clothes dishes. Brush teeth. All these mundane things. Im so sick of doing it. Shaving. Cutting hair. I dread going to bed every night. Takes alll night to sleep n when i do I wake up after 3 hours need to piss n then im wide awake for 5 hours. Then I cant get out of bed. Doesnât help my bedroom has no window. 
 
Im afraid of death but when i cant sleep n I wake up at 4 pm it makes me feel like strangling myself to death to stop this pain. I just want my life to take a break. But im also afraid ill lose out on more time if i go away somewhere away from work nd my goals of being a filmmaker. Im almost nearing 30. It scares me. Ik its not old but i feel I should have things in order by now. I donât wanna be 46 n have a kid. I donât wanna be a 60 year old dad when theyâre in their 20s. Im just so scared. 

This life is flashing by and i feel like im aging too. I look 17 but feel 50. Having your dysfunctional family degrade u at a young age i feel like i matured before everyone in my school n peers. Maybe thatâs y I struggled in school. I never got to just be a kid. So now that im an adult with my own money car n freedom i try to live everyday as its the last. I never partied when i was 15- 25. My neighbors never invited me when they were out partying. 
So I have this spontaneous mindset i guess. Heres an idea lets do it. But no one cares to. 

I just feel so fucked up. I honestly didnât think id make it past high school or 27 and now im 28. I hate that suicide has been with me for a majority of my life. It scares me .. if I canât shake it now nd so many 40 year olds kill themselves.. why will i be different?"
I will kill myselfI will die after 2 weeks in 23 march or i am planning to do it. I want to see Liverpool champions  before i die.
"Had the biggest zoom fail the other day My friend always sends whale emojis to me over zoom as a joke, so the other day I responded with âur obeseâ assuming it would set to private chat automatically. But it sent publicly and my actually overweight calc teacher thought I was talking to him so uhhh

Iâm ready to die cause like he seemed genuinely offended"
"I thought time would heal the wounds but...It's almost been three years since my suicide attempt.
The only reason I haven't tried to kill myself again is the guilt of leaving my loved ones behind and the fear of failing and being put in a psychiatric ward again. 
I know I have a good life and reasons to live for. I have a caring, sincere boyfriend who I live with. Steady job, on study leave right now at a school I like. Pets. Friends in school. On good terms with my family. Materialistic things.
It just doesn't feel worth it though. I spend most of my days with anxiety, feelings of disgust and hatred towards myself, anger as well as suicide thoughts. I've tried to reach out for help (last time was this summer) but I feel as if they don't take me seriously/don't understand what I'm saying. I'm at my breaking point and I really don't know what to do."
"Help meNy girlfriend broke up with me, now im even more depressed and suicidal. I plan to cut or soemthing soon."
"This is itHey all. Just gonna post here because I can't keep my thoughts bottled up anymore. I'm giving up. I was originally giving myself until the end of the year to fix myself but I've now realized I'm beyond fixing. I had one person left in my life that was keeping me alive. And for months my stupid brain has been telling me to push them away so that I can finally kill myself but I had always tried to fight it. Well last night my stupid brain/anxiety won. I'm done going to the psychologist. I'm done taking my meds. I thought they were helping but I came to realization that they are not. I've finally admitted to myself that everyone in my life would be better off with me dead. My mom, my sister, and pretty much anyone I've ever gotten close to. I denied it for months but I can't deny it anymore. All I've ever wanted was to make other people happy but all I can do is hurt people. So I think it's time to call it quits. I don't have a plan or anything for how I'm going to end it, but hopefully I can figure that out soon. Hopefully with me off my meds I can just go for it without much thought. So yeah you might see me around for a bit after this but hopefully not for too long. Oh and please, please, please don't try and stop me. I can't get better. I can only make others worse. This is the best option for everyone."
"I am the Happiest Person Most People KnowAnd I am so tired of it.

I work really hard to be this big ball of light for my friends and family. I emanate happiness. I laugh constantly. I smile all the fucking time. I also want to fucking kill myself.

It's hard because I don't know if I am an imposter or not, you know? I really *am* happy a lot of the time.  But I also really just want to die. I feel like I'm stuck in certain situations and there's no way out of them. I don't even really know where I'm going with this.

My point, if I have one anyways, is that I am both so fucking happy and so fucking sad. I can have 10/10 days every single day and still want to blow my brains out. I am confused and I am tired."

"Real Suppleroot Hours #930 Who up?

How has your day been so far?"
My school was weird So I went to a elementary school and it was be fine 1 teacher per class pe with a different teacher 30min break 1hour lunch and we could have literally anything the parents of the kids could bring in a lunch for the kid if they wanted to (or forgot to) . And you would be considered the âcoolâ kid if you got your mom to bring you McDonaldâs and a Coca Cola and it was only that combo nothing else was âcoolâ then the school lunch was the best. I donât know what everyone thinks about school lunches but mine were the best when it was elementary school but other schools I went to was really bad. The best part of the school I went to was that there was 1 male teacher and he was able the let everyone on a phone 3ds ds and that was great but he would say things like donât bring in an iPad donât take pictures of each other and the girls in the class would do that they would bring in an iPad and take pictures of everyone
"Fuck asktransgenderFuck the mods at r/asktransgender I make a post about what Iâm struggling with as a trans woman and they just ban and mute me without explanation.  

Well Iâll tell you what - Iâm going to blow my brains out tonight in the middle of a major city and Iâm going to have their names written on my body so the media can have fun contacting those fucking cunts about what they know about why I blew my head off.

Fuck everyone and fuck all of your stupid fucking privileged lives"
"My ""Ima do it later"" attitude is getting out of hand Doing school work just at the last possible moment is normal, telling my parents for months that I'll clean my room too but I've hit a new low. It has come to me shoving Anime I want to watch for a couple of weeks back."
"i have OCD, i feel like never im not going to get betteri have anxiety everyday, i feel pain by thinking. Almost all the time my head is torturing me.  I started taking antidepressants recently (sertraline, a ssri).

 If this does not work, I am really considering killing myself, this disease ruined all my relationships and ruins me, it has ruined me for many years. I feel very weak for this world, it's full of people with the power to be, but i can't.

 I feel alone in my head with all of this."

"i hate awards now that i said that i will write some dumb reason why truly to bait you into thinking youâre annoying me. 

ok real talk. any post about awards is a post asking for them. some are super simple like saying â i donât like awardsâ then they get like 50. some are more complicated but anytime someone brings up not liking awards they think youâre dumb enough to fall for reverse psychology. 

someone is definitely going to say âwHaT aBoUt tHis poSt. iSnâT it aSKiNg for reWarDs.â and yea ofc but itâs also a tad bit of a PSA."
"Everything hurtsI've fought depression for the last half a decade, and I've gotten better the past 2 years. But here I am, back to the trench, and I feel like I'm drowning. Everyday feels so heavy, sometimes just empty.

I dedicated myself to my work, and I've done great so far. I help out my family financially. I am very well loved by my family, friends, and girlfriend, but I don't like sharing my problems with them. I don't want to burden them. The same with my friends.

This is my 2nd life. I've done something stupid in the past. Back then, I used to cut. I also had an anorexia. I acknowledged it as wrong. But now that I'm back in this trench, why do I feel like it wasn't as stupid as I thought it to be?

I have no idea what my problem is. I just want to die. I want to end it all. I tell my friends (very close best friends) that I'm going to get a therapist, but that's not what I really want. It hurts so much.

For the past months, I have *moments* of sadness, sometimes disinterest in everything. But this week, it just hurts so much. Everything just aches. It just hurts. It's been like this for the past week.

I cry when I'm alone, but all I can do is smile around people close to me.

I want to be saved, but at the same time, I don't. Please help me. I've gone through this, but I don't understand what I'm feeling."
"I canât take it anymoreEverything in my life is gradually going to shit and getting worse, from my home life to my motivation and grades to my mental state. Thinking about all the problems I have, and not knowing how to deal with them or if I can, makes me grow more desperate. I feel alone and like Iâm slowly drowning.

Iâve tried to improve by myself and I canât. Itâs too much to deal with on my own. My only hope for getting help or some counseling is in a few months in college. But the idea of making it there is looking bleaker, and I may not even be able to get help anyways. I doubt Iâll even be able to function in college if I keep deteriorating like I am now either. Not even just mentally, but as a person I feel like Iâm getting worse. Becoming more bitter, negative, and just shitty. Itâs like Iâm slowly on the path to insanity or something, and I donât know how to change course. I donât want to be alive to see myself downgrade more not knowing how to stop.

I have no clue how to deal with my emotions on my own. I know I have a lot of suppressed emotions from all the bullshit thatâs happened this year, but idk how to deal with it all on my own. I canât keep living with this pain for a few more months. When thereâs not even a guarantee that itâll get better, and I have nothing to keep me going to make up for it. 

This year has been the absolute worst of my life. Not only did my internal problems get 100x worse, with my stupid intrusive thoughts and ocd starting right at the beginning of the year, I had to deal with the loss of a family member and all the grief and painful shit that comes with that. Which I still donât know how to deal with completely and I know itâs the main thing thatâs messing me up right now. I didnât know what real pain and problems were until this year. Everything else before was stupid. Iâd give anything to go back and have the fucking âproblemsâ I had the last 3 years. 

Thats the main thing thatâs affecting my home life and my relationship with my mom. I donât know how to communicate with her about anything anymore. Itâs like Iâve emotionally shut myself off from her for some reason. These past few months. The good relationship I had with her Iâm slowly ruining. I donât want to be alive to see myself getting more estranged from her. Im scared of losing her, maybe not even just physically but emotionally too. But it feels like thatâs whatâs gonna end up happening, if nothing else happens to her, and I donât know how to stop it.  

I get anxiety being around her, worrying about losing her young too and something happening to her or her developing some problem. I donât want to deal with the pain and stupid grief of losing another parent. Fuck I can barely handle the loss of one. Iâd rather die than go through it again. Itâs like that security and comfort I had is gone. Itâs like now I know anything can happen, because thatâs just how the world fucking works. Thereâs no guarantee or security that something wonât happen again. 

Itâs almost unbearable, the worry and anxiety over this. So Iâm slowly distancing myself from her and cutting ties emotionally I guess. To protect myself from some pain or loss that hasnât even fucking happened yet. Itâs ironic, I donât want to lose her but yet Iâm ruining our relationship and wasting the time I have with her now while I have her. Because of fear of losing her in the long run soon. Itâs stupid.

This year Iâve wasted all the energy I had with people and to make friends, on toxic ones. Itâs happened to me three separate times. the last one was like two months ago. Itâs fuckin taxing, starting a friendship with someone you think will be worthwhile and putting in the effort, only to later find out they were just using me or being manipulative, or they just plainly showed they did not care about me at all, and having to cut them off or stop talking to them because itâs just worse. Just giving myself more unnecessary pain and trauma than I already had to deal with. It hurts. And I know itâs my own fault for not seeing the signs. I tell myself I learned my lesson and it wonât happen again, but I know it probably will because Iâm just gullible and easily manipulated. Iâd give anything to go back and not have met any of them . I wasted my time and effort and was only met with more problems now, and pain in the end. 

Those âfriendshipsâ led me to now be more hesitant to talk to people and reach out, when it wasnât as much of a problem for me before. So now when I meet people that I know would be good friends or it would be a healthy friendship or something, I hesitate to talk to them. Messaging people back makes me more anxious now and I hesitate a lot more to, and it takes me days now at best to get the courage to respond. Even if I know they want to talk to me or do stuff with me. Obviously ruining the friendship before it really even starts, because how the fuck can it work like that. Fuck I even get scared to open social media now sometimes for some reason. Like discord or snap and some other places. I donât know why, itâs like it reminds me or something. Itâs bullshit. I fucked myself up more. I wish I hadnât given my time and energy to those people when they were the last ones to fucking deserve it. Maybe itâs better that I donât make friendships as easily, who tf would want to talk to me anyways. There are better people out there.

I have absolutely nothing keeping me going, except a small hope in myself and the hope that it can get better in college. But it just feels stupid and that hope is lessening more and more. It feels like everyone else has at least one person or external thing that keeps them going or pushing through the bad. Everytime I think I have something, it just ends up failing or it gets ruined. But itâs just right that Iâm not one of those people. I messed up everything for myself with my choices and actions. Maybe if I did have something Iâd be able to push through all this crap.

I isolated myself from my group of friends that I know cared somewhat, a few weeks ago, because I felt like I was bothering them too much and just annoying them. And now I fucking lost them. One of the few good things that happened to me this year. Like the idiot I am. Itâs funny how I gravitate towards the people harmful to me easily while pushing away the ones that are good for me. 

Thereâs no one that cares. The ones that claim to just do it out of pity. Theyâd all move on anyways, Iâm not important enough to be remembered or be sad over for too long. Just easily forgotten and forgettable. There are better people out there anyways and life goes on. 

Iâm tired of waking up to face another day with either false hope or mental/emotional pain. I donât want to cry any more useless tears. Hopefully these are the last ones I ever have to. I donât want to see myself get worse in multiple aspects. I don t want to keep searching for something to keep me going or to make the pain worthwhile. I donât want to see everything around me crumble even more. I donât want to deal with anymore pain. I have too many problems that I donât know how to fix and I canât keep dealing with for the next few months, the easier way is just to end it. I shouldâve done it back in the summer when I had the urges and means to for the first time. Sure things got better for a time but now Iâm here. even worse than before. Anyone in my place would have killed themselves months ago probably.

I wouldâve never thought my life would end up like this a few years ago. Thatâd it reach this point. It even hurts to fucking look in the mirror at this point sometimes. To see how Iâve ended up and what Iâve become. I donât even recognize myself anymore. Anything good I had is just overshadowed by the bad and all the crap now. Its like itâs all I can see in myself now, more and more everyday. Sure Iâm still young and things can turn around. But it wonât happen on its own and I feel like Iâm on a bad path that I canât turn around from, myself, anymore. 

Thereâs no point in being alive to witness myself become something I despise even more. I see hints of that now and it hurts. 

I played my cards wrong in life and Iâm paying the consequences now I guess. I doubt Iâll be alive by the end of this year. Thereâs no guarantee things wonât be just as bad or worse next year, or heck even for the rest of my life. Iâll probably chicken out and not have to courage to do anything this weekend. If I donât chicken out, consider this my suicide note or something. "

"Does anyone have so hugs left? Stupid me Luxembourg city on my own because i wanted to see more of europe (im 15) and i made a school project out of it so i could go. I booked a hostel and hoped that i would meet people from my age and get new friends. But instead of having fun, im just sitting alone in my room feeling bad about everything. I could really use some hugs right now...."

"Hello. Me again...So just over a week ago I made a post on here about my situation and many of the reasons why I feel like I want to kill myself. I can't be bothered to go through them again so give that a look.

Since that post things have only gotten worse. Any attempt at trying to get help hasn't worked, and I am constantly feeling more and more hopeless.

I am honestly sick of my parents, especially my mum, as they keep trying to force me into situations that make me anxious and uncomfortable, despite any protests from me.

School is becoming much worse, as I am in a very competitive school environment, and despite doing well against most people, I still feel like I'm utterly failing in some subjects, and that I don't have the motivation to fix the issues.

I'm in constant fear of putting myself as transgender to people at school and my parents, due to my regularity of being a target for bullies and the uncertainty of my parents' reaction.

I easily get mad at every little mistake and end up breaking and throwing stuff, despite the mistakes not mattering, which makes me just feel like a selfish, perfectionist git.

Every day I have some thought of killing myself, that I can't get help, that there's no reason to carry on and that things will just get worse. I just don't know what to do anymore."
"Don't want to carry on.Feel like a spoiled child with that title but it is what it is. I'll attempt to be as brief as I can.

Failing uni and I'm not sure I care about my degree (music) anyway. I have a close friend who usually helps with these things but I haven't had a response from them. They mean the world to me, but when they are late to respond I start freaking out about how much I trust them etc. There are valid reasons but that story is way too long to be telling here. Point is we've patched things up since all the drama in the past, and since then I've lost it at them for what turned out to be nothing before so I'm posting here instead. I'd really rather not make that mistake again.

Basically I'm dead weight and I have no hope for the future. I've dragged myself on to not hurt others but I'm really questioning the point in continuing. Do I ever get to say 'right, I tried, can I give up now?'

No, obviously I don't. You have to live with it to keep everyone else happy. I can hear (see?) it now: 'suicide is never the answer...'"

"Professional helpI tried professional help once and it seemed useless and stupid. I canceled my next session and never went to therapy again. Was my experience maybe just bad luck and do any of u feel like therapy without medication really does anything?
I don't think i'll kill myself anytime soon but maybe in a year or two after i still accomplished nothing."

"Everything I know about life is a lieI have never felt so fucking numb in front of the mirror with a loaded gun all I feared the most is wanting love but chasing ghosts,I can't live like this anymore every day is agony. Some people say it will get better but if the futures so bright, the path should glow and all i see is inevitable death. Life has no meaning the only way to be happy is to lie to ourselfs until we belive that lie. Im 16 an i never had a gf or bf i feel like im unlovable fuck-up and all i do is meaningless. Im from Croatia and here is big stigma about everything i stand for and believe in. I can' be honest with anyone because then they would make fun of me and I'm rarely in the mood for a fight so i just keep it to myself but at the same time i feel like if you are not yourself then you're nothing. Does somebody have some advice?"
"today was fucking wild so, i've been questioning myself for years now, but i never knew exactly what i was. recently, i watched the reboot of she-ra on netflix and one of the characters introduced me to the idea of being non binary. once i did some research, it all clicked in my head. i came out to my girlfriend, and we talked for nearly two hours. during which, she came out as panromantic and asexual. i always dreaded the times when being ace would interfere with our relationship, but it turns out she's ace too!

sorry for being a rambling mess, but excitement kinda makes me go monkey mode. also, this is my first reddit post officially outta the closet. it'll take a while to get used to they/them, but i already feel so much happier!"

"I look so ugly it's making me feel suicidal.As a woman, I have the most abnormal nose you will ever come across. I have been ridiculed by it and laughed at as my nose is so long compared to my small face. 

I'm 23 and have no money for a nose job. I feel anxious getting a job because of my appearance. Even if I do get my nose fixed, I get anxious about getting with men that may not have even liked me before my nose job. And what If I have kids that are born with my nose. 

I know you think I'm kidding but I'm not. It just makes me seriously depressed. All my siblings have small, normal noses. Yet I get landed with a freak show in the middle of my face?! Anyone relate."

"Life sucks, especially love and feelings So my life in the short version: Was bullied at elementary, then still in the 5th and 6th grade. I'll graduate this year. I'm A musician without ANY gigs right now.
And my main issue: Can't meet friends or HER. So many friends of mine are very busy and that sucks. My sing and song writing workshop isn't going on for about seven months. Last year I had a very hard crush on a girl over six months and I've never had a girlfriend.
I met another girl half a year ago. And I guess there could be something between us. BUT her parents are very strict and she isn't allowed to meet with a ""stranger"" (I'm not a stranger to her of course). In addition to that she's like not time to text or FaceTime with me but I'd really like if we could meet and may we could even get together.
Write whatever you want guys, just wanted to get that off my chest.
Btw, new here.
Ps: I guess I'm kinda depressive for a one and a half year, no motivation and other symptoms. But I've never thought about suicide or smth."
"Endless cycle of bad jobsI have continuously accepted crappy jobs due to needing a job because I need money.

Iâm so stressed out Iâm not sleeping. They wonât even let me take unpaid time off. My health and well being is suffering but I desperately need whatever little money the job provides.

"I hurt the person I love the most and I can't cope with itLast night I told my girlfriend the best thing to do is to break up before it's too late because we weren't going anywhere.  
We dated for about a month 2 years ago but it was something very superficial and we both got the wrong ideas from each other. After we broke up she was pretty affected and she started dating a good friend of mine for about 6 months. (It's worth noting that my friend didn't know that we had been together until they were already dating). That hurt me for a while but in time I understood that they were both happier this way and that gave me the power to get over it. I also didn't talk to her until like a month or 2 before they broke up when I messaged her saying that I want thing to be okay between us. She also apologized for some things and we remained friends.  
Recently, after about 10 months, we started to talk more and hang out and one day she said that she wants to have a serious discussion with me to talk about some things that remained unsolved between us. After we talked we both realized that we were in love with each other but I told her that nothing can ever happen between us because she really meant something for my friend she dated.  
But I couldn't do it. It felt like the universe was giving me a second chance, to do things right, and I rejected it. So I told her that if she can bear waiting for a little longer I will do everything that was in my power to make this happen. She understood me and helped me with everything she could. After weeks of frustration, thinking and talking with people I realized that the best thing to do is to talk directly to my friend. So we both talked with him about this very in depth and he said that he is fine with it. So we finally went for it but it was obvious that he only said that to be a good guy and he still had feelings for her, because I have been through that.  
And now I got to the point when I can't hold it in me anymore. I knew I was being a shit friend for doing that so I told her that if I continue like this the relationship is going to fall. I told her last night that it's better to finish everything now since the more we wait the more it will hurt. We also decided that it's better not to talk with each other at all from now on.  
And today she scared the crap out of me because me and some good friends of ours tried to contact her and she didn't respond to anyone for a good part of the day. After she told her best friend that she is fine I calmed down a bit but now I can't stop thinking about the fact that I ruined everything life could give me and I the woman I love told me that nothing ever hurt her as much as this.  
I know she would never forgive me for this and I know that if I try to enter in her life again all I would do is more harm. My soul is crushed right now and I thought that at least writing this here will keep me from physically harming myself.  

**TL;DR:** I broke up with the woman I love in the worst way possible and I hate myself to death"
"I just want to dieI canât take living with my paranoid and over-controlling mother anymore. Iâm 18 years old and she still monitors me like Iâm 12. She goes through my phone, has restrictions on it so that I canât do anything on it that she canât see unless itâs on an app that I can delete later that she doesnât have my login info too. She controls who I can see, what I wear, where I work, when I go to bed, and wonât give me any respect or privacy. Iâm a college student and Iâm not allowed to meet up with friends unless sheâs met them and thereâs an adult chaperone that she knows there. I feel trapped and alone. I just want so badly to escape from her but I donât have a way too. The only way out is suicide but she doesnât leave me at home alone and she has all the knives and medicines in a locked cabinet. I just want to die. Why canât it be easier to just end my life so that I donât have to suffer being treated like this anymore?"
"Taking off my alert bracelet.It's a fabric bracelet with a metal plate on it. Has my husband's contact details, my name, the words AUTISM, PLEASE BE PATIENT.

It's got me returned home four times when I've tried to spare feelings and run away to have an accident. I forget about it until a well-meaning passer by or policeman sees the medical alert symbol.

I'd call Samaritans but I'd be practically indecipherable through my disgusting slushy lisp that makes everyone assume I'm low functioning and backwards instead of the opposite and troubled. I made the stupid bracelet for when I'm not in my right mind.

I'm sick of being seen as slow. I'm sick of seeing the uncomfortable look on peoples faces when I start speaking with my slurry, pressured speech. It's worse when I notice this and the stress pressures the speech more.

I'm 20 and apparently since nobody helped me cure it as a child, it's not important as an adult as I've learned to live with it.

I've been sick for a long time and I feel guilty that my catalyst for anonymous suicide is speech, but I can only take so much. I'm alone till noon tomorrow."
"This is gonna sound so stupid... but i need someone right now. Im so emotionally drained, iâve been crying for the past 6 days, ive lost my appetite, my motivation, everything. I genuinely donât know what to do and i wanna die. 

I just got out of a heavy, toxic relationship. But i miss her so much- she was my world, my motivation to do better. Obviously i want to be on that âking shitâ but in reality... i miss her. I miss our convos, her laugh, her smile. 
I genuinely dont think iâll ever find anyone like her again, we were soulmates. 

Even my best friend of near enough 5 years is turning on me now.. because he coincidentally dated her best friend. They were on shit terms, he got broken but now theyâre starting up again. And heâs making me feel shit about everything that had happened to me- because its always so much negative talk, i cant even talk to someone without them corrupting the convo with pain. 

I dont know what to do."
"I can't live with myself because of what I've doneI cheated on my husband at the end of December. I haven't told him and I don't want him to find out. It was such a mistake. A stupid drunk mistake. I didn't even want to do it - I kept telling the guy ""no I don't want to have sex with you"" but he kept pressuring me and pressuring me and I felt I had to. I think about it everyday. It's eating me alive. I don't want my husband to find out. I'm just so scared I am going to lose him if he does. I don't know what I would do if he found out. I regret it so bad. I just want to disappear. I am a bad person and I hate myself for doing this to him. I'm sorry I'm just rambling right now. I just feel like I'm in a very dark place right now and I'm scared"
"Guys, I broke my TV so like, here i am sitting in front if my smashed TV, when all of the sudden Santa Claus comes through my chimney and say ""you got two options, you can either be a saint, or a grinch"" then i turned into the [grinch](https://youtu.be/BuKft9LpL_0) and danced outside, what a terrible day."
My friend saved my life.So last Tuesday I was going to kill myself. I went to say goodbye to my Discord friends.  My friend saw the message and spent a while talking me out of suicide. I'm glad he did. Thanks so much dude.
"I've tried, over and over. I thought I had a shot this time, I really did.It sounds nice to throw this out to the anonymous world, and I'm really grasping for straws, so here goes nothing.

Im a failing college student, with 100k+ in debt, and not even a Junior yet.  I had a really rough accident that put my whole life on hold before covid, and really started this downturn.  after finally recovering to some semblance of my old self, i returned to school this semester, only to now realize what a giant fucking mistake that was. every class i enrolled in started off well, but I've stopped going to classes because i just cant handle the stress and misery theyre causing me on top of everday life rn. Im going to fail everything. and even if i withdraw, ill lose financial aid for the future.

Im damned if i go back and damned if i dont.

Recently some events have dug up feelings i had for somone. The first girl i really caught feelings for in my adult life. We started off friends, and it was just amazing. She was smart, funny, cool, and for whatever reason, liked spending time with me. Naturally i caught feelings. Never worked up the courage to tell her, but im sure she knew, and i just kept acting like a normal friend because I valued our friendship over the possibility of anything more. 

Long story short, COVID hit and alot changed. our friendship got stressed by various things, and without going into it, I walked away feeling used and rejected, as alot had changed. Theres alot more to it, but the emotional pain surrounding this person is uncomparable to anything else ive experienced, and sometimes i tear up and cry just thinking about it.

I hate myself, I hate that ive wasted so much. So much potential. so much of my parents resources. Just so much. 

I hate how i look, how i speak, how im socially inept, fucking everything.

I used to be so on top of everything. Everything was looking up. Now, i dont see a way out. I dont have the courage to speak to my parents about this fail of a semester, and how to move forward. there is no forward.

Im sorry most of all to you Dad. I cried for hours when you told me the story of how scared you were when you found out mom was pregnant with me. You were worried you be a shitty father like your father, and it overwhelmed you so much. Im sorry for all the trouble i gave you over the years. And most importantly, Im sorry i wasted all the resources and love you gave me. Please understand there's nothing anyone could have done or said. 

The world gave me every oppurtunity and i just fucked it away."

"wanting nothing is still 'something',but i want nothing and the closed ellipsis is in offense of itself. there have been times when i just wanted to sleep, or go somewhere very far away, or prove some point to people left behind, or not to prove any point but simply let it cease to matter at the end of personal existence. all of these things have too much thing-ness for what i'm feeling now.

you can fuck up something at work and wish you could just go home to sleep for a week, or get yourself involved in some love that can never resolve itself and wish that you could simply have your person without the rest of it in the way, and all of that can come out in passionate fits of wanting to die. you could be lonely and wish you lived where your friends lived, and feel like you'll succumb to the exhaustion of that distance before you even try to cross it. you can receive high praise for your first steps into the arena of your life's work and become so afraid of failure that you would rather that life end than suffer a humiliation. 

and then theres just not wanting any of it. it isn't the act or what it symbolizes, it's not even an escape. an escape needs a present location and a future location, joined by a flow from undesirable to desirable states. i don't want to assess my surroundings for desirability, and i don't know if they are even undesirable. the thought of desire at all makes me uncomfortable, and i suppose that is the problem: i just can't get comfortable anywhere. i want a nothing that is already present and presently encompassing, like darkness on the inner eyelid without there ever having been an outer.

this does come close to a bleak acceptance of simply living without attachment, but i know the small wants will come up like grass again. sometimes that's lush. i've lived a long time just to feel the rush of something to want. other times, it just itches, and i wish it would not. 

i used to worry about my experience of trauma, until i told myself it did not matter anymore, that it was the past and i had spent enough time in the past. i still don't care that much about any of what happened to my body or mind, but i wonder if that compulsion to violence against this body and mind has been left here with me. and maybe that's why, when death is something to want, when a surgical and precise act of violence against the self is something to want, all in spite of wanting nothing, surely there is a 'nothing' more featureless and nonexistent than the act of suicide - i just don't know how. i can't find it. i think i truly believe in suicide more than i believe in anything. i believe in its resolution and its certainty, and even in times of contentment, have never felt like any path or opportunity is so certain except the option to take my own life."

"So.. I just want to kill myself or to just stop existing.Like, rn i was clenching my teeth. But i just noticed it. I've been doing it a lot lately without realising it. My chest aches. There's this piercing pain and heaviness around my heart. I feel like im lost in this abyss of emptiness, exhaustion and pain.
Im falling apart. My body and mind want to give up. I can't escape. And i know its my fault. Im slipping away from sanity and happiness. Happiness feels so far away now. Im tearing apart from the inside. Being alone is hell but being around people is too tiring and makes me anxious. I feel lonely and empty. There's no way of comforting myself. Ive pushed everyone away. Im no good for anyone. I just. I want to stop existing. Am I asking for too much?? No. Im just a coward. A hypocrite and a fraud. Truth is I deserve to die. Im useless. A waste of space."

I'm now trying to study and failing even at that because of my insanely annoying panic attacks that settle in anytime I use my brain.

Upgraded my knife to a sharper one because I wanna see blood. I want it deeper.

I just can't anymore. I feel worthless, shitty. Even worse is that my brother's birthday is tomorrow. What if I had died of that OD, and he didn't notice until tomorrow? Or what if I accidentally slit my wrists open and bleed out, the day before his birthday.

3 days until I get to see a psychiatrist and doctor to get put on a real, stronger anti-dep which is possible to OD on. Let's see if I even can make it till then."

"I'm not even sure why I'm posting thisI don't even know where to start. I posted some topics here a few years ago, discussing why I am depressed. The short of it is, I used to be a devout christian, until sometime mid 2008 a rapid and overwhelming series of events forced me to realize that if there is a god, he is a royal jackass and unworth any man's love or obedience. This sent me spiraling into depression and eventually a bastard combination of depression and nihilism. I got a job at one point, which I promptly deserted after three days. I've successfully destroyed just about every social facet of my life. And now I have moved on from simple self-loathing and hopelessness to actually hating each individual member of humanity; Viewing everyone as a corrupt, backstabbing, and utterly vile creature, wishing nothing short of complete genocide upon this entire damned race.

Would I ever actually kill anyone? No, not unless I could take out everyone at once, which is obviously an impossible goal. So any efforts would be utterly pointless. This does however prevent me from ever carrying on a ""normal"" life, as I look at everyone with nothing but hatred and paranoia. This of course leads to even more feelings of isolation and loneliness. Couple this with the fact that I, as mentioned, view all things as entirely pointless and trivial, and thus not worth the time or effort, and it's obvious why my suicidal desires have only intensified over these last few years.

Obviously I realize that I'm irreparably stunted and broken as a human, and my complete and utter lack of effort in taking care of my diabetes (Type I) mean that I should just do the inevitable and off myself."

Noone can understand my situation so don't bother asking. And I'm not looking to talk to anyone, you can't help. So why am I posting? I don't know, I guess there's just no one in my life who cares, so might as well vent to strangers. "

"It takes a minute to destroy your lifeToday, I am a 28 year old woman.

It took 4 years before my mother left my dad, both angry to be in a marriage with each other. It took two weeks for him to die in some freak fishing accident. God knows how long it took for him to drown but it took one death for the county to remove a fallen tree people complained about for years.

It took 7 years of abuse before my mother was arrested for almost killing me. One night for her to wrap her hands around my neck all because I took her bracelet. It then took her two years to work on herself before she could regain custody of me while then starting a lovely cycle of emotional abuse for the next 14 years because thatâs how you build your daughter up, right?

It took seven years for my first suicide attempt, climbing to the top of a bookshelf in my first grade class because I thought falling from a great height would do it. First grade and I wanted to die. Fucking first grade. But no one noticed any fucking issue with me other than I was dramatic and had horrible rage. They ignore the black eyes, they ignored my hunger from being denied food. It took another 7 years for my second suicide attempt. Nothing happened, I moved on. It took another 7 years, because I just love the number 7, and that got me into a treatment facility. It took 20 years for a bipolar diagnosis, one week to ignore it, and one month to accept it.

It took 19 years to build some sort of confidence in myself. It took 12 years to gain a true friend and another 6 to gain more friends. It took one night to be taken advantage of by a man I didnât know, 2 hours for him to be found outside my dorm room rundown, and ten minutes to be told by a woman that my case wasnât believable.

It took 23 years to get over all of that. It took 23 years to find a man who loved me despite all my issues. It took 23 years to realize that everything horrible in my life lead me to him. Everything bad in my life was building me up to something great. It took 4 years to feel accepted and loved, to realize that I am more than what my mother, my aunt, my cousin, my other aunt, I was more than what they thought of me, what they called me, what the screamed at me when I didnât want to do what they wanted, when they kicked me out, when they said Iâd make a horrible girlfriend, horrible wife, horrible mother because of who I am. It took 4 years for someone to make me feel loved and accepted because it was what I thought I deserved.

It took one fucking afternoon to do the ONE FUCKING THING I DO BEST: Destroy it.

I was wrong. I deserve to feel these things. I deserve to be shot down and sent to hell. I deserve to die. Because no one will care when Iâm not here. No one will bat any fucking eyelashes when I donât show up to any future reunions, when I donât answer any texts, when I donât respond on Facebook.

It took one day to destroy my life. It took 5 months to realize my mistake. It took 7 months to realize my worth. It will take &lt;10 minutes to kill myself.

The only fucking thing 2019 has taught me is that Iâve been on this planet to suffer. All my life, Iâve been put through some sort of fucked up test, and Iâm not a strong woman. And yes, I did this to myself. I always do these things to myself. I get a good thing I destroy it, I hurt people. So Iâm going to just do it. I have to do it this time. Because I canât do this anymore. I canât feel like this anymore. I canât watch him love her.

If you read this far, cool. Iâm checking out. I canât do this anymore. If it works, awesome. If it doesnât, well, I did learn I can still get a gun so maybe Iâll look into that. Iâm not sure if I care about pain at this point anymore.

And if it isnât today, itâll be before the end of the month. But itâs going to be soon. Because Iâm done. Iâm just fucking done."

"I know it sounds dumb it was really cute, I picked some leaves out of my GFs hair Yeah it sounds dumb, but during break today she kicked some leaves at me, so I kicked some at her, long story short she's super short and she got some leaves in her hair.

So I say ""hey you got some leaves in your hair"" 

And she kinda randomly bats at her head to get them out, so I walked up to her and picked them out and she was looking up at me with a really cute eyes while I got one of the pieces out.

Idk, I found it really cute for some reason, although I'm weird and deprived of physical affection, so."
"My mom never fucking listens to me and I genuinely want to kill myself because I canât take this goddamn constant pressure to be a functioning adult when I canât be.I have told my mom countless times that I canât drive because I disassociate at least twenty times a day for up to two hours at a time, and that I canât get a job because I have such a low will to live that I wouldnât be able to keep up on my work or bring myself to even show up to the workplace. 

The first problem is not the biggest deal, I can have friends give me rides places, or hire an Uber(or similar) service to get around. But it the second issue that is the worst thing. As far as I know, I donât qualify for the disability thing where the government gives you money if you canât work because of a disability, but like I said, I would never be able to even GO to my workplace, let alone do work, and this wouldnât be able to keep a job. 

Yet despite these reasons, which I should mention she finds valid for OTHER PEOPLE, she still insists that Iâm a lazy piece of shit who uses my anxiety and depression as an excuse to never do things. 

So Iâm fed up. I donât know how much longer I can take this."
"Help me dictate my next moveHi Iâm 19 years old, I donât know what actually happened to me in a way, I mean sure I was bullied when I was young till I was 17, but at some point Iâm used to bullying, got a girlfriend when I was 18 just breaking up after something weird starting to happen to me;

I was questioning my life, questioning everything. That time I never felt lonelier and nothing I do is meaningful. I didnât have friends and was mostly lonely all the time, itâs seriously tiring and very suffocating. It feels so heavy to live and just continue to go on. I wanted more from life I think when I know life canât offer more. Iâll admit Iâm in no position to complain; my family is privileged (quite rich Iâd say), I signed a contract for a sponsorship when I was 17, and basically I have no reason to complain, but I still didnât feel happy at all, I feel miserable and all I do is spend my money on some stupid stuff just to seek for that random happiness, Iâve been fighting off my thoughts that tells me to just end it all for real and for good, I tried to hang myself a couple times, but I donât know whatâs stopping me.

Itâs been a year now, Iâm on medication 1.5 tablet of lexapro and 0.5 tablet of aripriprazole and am going to therapy, itâs been a year since but Iâm still not happy at all and I just wanna die. The feeling of being miserable, not belonging and the feeling of just not important is overwhelming me and I just wanna die, Iâll post this here and give myself 24 hours to let the Reddit community decide my next fate, Iâm so tired of fighting this off and all I get is some advice that I tried before like meditation and stuff but trust me it ainât helping, and the more I tried and it didnât help, the more I feel incurable and the more hopeless I feel. 

Haha cheers to the last 24 hours!"

"My fight with the spider So I was minding my own business wasting time as usual when this mysterious figure caught my eye. It was a spider, hanging from a single thread right next to me.

My happy days just working with the cattle with my dad.

Most of its gone now. I'm going to wake up tomorrow to a fourth week in a row with only two days off (I had to beg for one of them.)

I miss all my buddies from college and my old job. I'm not even asking for a solution; there is none, except to wait out until it gets better.

Sorry. Rough month."
"Apparently being high functioning means you can't have mental health problemsMy therapist and my mom constantly downplay my mental health problems. I'm diagnosed with PTSD and I struggle with anxiety, depression, derealization, and drug dependency. I'm gay. I'm also lowkey gender dysphoric, but I'm not nearly brave enough to express that. Despite all that, I manage to get straight A's (I'm a high schooler) and I've built a good college resume so far.

They're convinced that since I'm on a 'good path' that my life will be great. ""You're tall! You're handsome! You're gonna get into a great college! Why are you so worried?"" I just want to note: this is not a humble brag. I don't feel handsome. I don't feel like I'm capable of being successful as a professional. I don't feel like I'm going to ever make meaningful friendships or relationships.

What I DO feel is that, in accordance with the last few years, my mental health is going to get worse as times goes on and I'll reach a point of not being able to take it. Why on Earth do they think that just because I'm high functioning in actuality that my mental health is in check? Do they know how many talented athletes and students kill themselves every year? I constantly feel myself closer to joining their ranks.

Yes, I do well in school. That's because my anxiety is so strong that if I am not achieving perfection in my grades, my body, and my relationships that I am a nervous wreck and I feel like shit. I'm constantly chasing perfection, hopelessly.

Yes, I have accomplished things. That's because I feel intense pressure to get into a good school so that I can hopefully have some stability, since I can SENSE how unstable my fucking head is.

Yes, I'm tall. Do I want to be 6'3""? Hell no. I want to be a woman. I want to feel feminine. I HATE my height. I hate having the body type of a football player, despite hating sports.

I just want to say to everyone here who may have experienced dissonance between the life they have created for themselves and how they feel inside. Please know that mental health is NOT the life you have created. It IS how you feel inside. 

Some could have a mansion, a superhero body, and a sexy husband and still be fucking miserable. Some could have a modest life and be very content. It's not a simple issue :("

"I want to give upJesus Christ I feel like everything is slow. I'm mad and sad and angry at the same time. I feel like a waste of space and completely worthless to everyone around me.

In the bigger picture I was always a lazy, stupid idiot who couldn't do anything. My goal in life was to be somebody, but with the way things have been going I'm bound to be a nobody loser scum of the earth piece of trash and I really don't want to continue living until that's actually true "

"Please give me an honest opinion, even if it means crucifying me in the comments. Idk where to post this, I dont think it fits on AITA since this is all hypothetical but I want someone's opinion about this.

Sometimes I feel like I have no remorse, and no ability to even feel emotionally attached to anything, I didn't cry at my grandma's funeral and I probably wouldnt bat an eye if my parents died this second. It almost scares me that I might one day go out, murder people and just be completely fine with it. I dont think Ive ever felt bad for doing something that hurt someone, be it emotional physical or otherwise and in all honesty there is a part of me that wants to experience hurting someone or being hurt just to know what it feels like. Idk why, theres always been a part of me that just wants to hurt people. Not to mention that I physically cannot cry unless I myself is the one that is hurt, like sure I cry when my parents shout at me for extended periods of time but even that is rare and I dont think Ive cried because of anything else. Its to the point Im scared of not feeling remorse or fear. So am I a psychopath or what am I?"

"When the problem is a lack of loveWe've all heard the ""get a therapist"" and ""go with a professional"" thing at least once. We know therapists, psychiatrists, etc, are supposed to help us with whatever is making us feel bad. 

But, guys, let's be honest with ourselves. There are times when no professional, drug, or therapy can solve a problem which origin comes from a lack of love. Of caring. Of tenderness. Of, yes, love. 

It's frustrating for many people to see that what is supposed to help them feel better, what's supposed to help them to overcome pretty dark moments, just doesn't work. And I find it horrible that those professionals aren't honest with their pacients. They keep talking shit, they keep prescribing them drugs, they keep promising a bright future that never comes, etc. But they never say ""hey, I'm sorry, I can't help you with this. There's nothing I can do to fullfill that empty space you've got"". 


So, since they aren't honest, and they won't ever tell you the truth because their opportunity to pay those expensive holidays they want will only exist if you don't find out that they can't help you with your problem; I'm going to tell you what you need to hear:


No therapy, no professional of any kind, no drug of any kind, can replace what you need and you've never had. That thing is love. And it may be hard to hear, I know; but it's the truth. You need to know it. 
And I won't start talking shit about ""there's someone waiting for you out there"", ""you'll find that person, I promise"", because it's the same shit professionals do. 

That's all I have to say."

I've though of calling a hotline but when I do, I'm in such a bad shape I wouldn't even know what to say. It's difficult to explain being depressed for seemingly trivial or imagined reasons, and I always feel like it would just be me crying drunk on the phone.

"Does taking a break really help?For the past 5 or 6 years I have wanted to kill my self. There has not been a week when I havenât thought about ending my life in multiple different ways. One of the main reasons I hold on is the thought that itâll get better (the main reason is to avoid hurting the people around me). But in the process of holding on and trying to live a ânormalâ life in spite of my suicidal thoughts, the extra stress, disappointment, anxiety and fear that comes with it make me want to die even more. 

Iâm still young and living with my parents, so I have considered the option of taking time to sort my mental health out before committing to school/a career but will I end up losing out in the end? Iâm afraid that by taking the extra time to improve myself, Iâll be left behind by my friends and family around me . 

Have any of you taken a break to sort out your head? Was it worth it? Does the time that you lose really bother you in the long run? Every day it gets harder and harder to get out of bed and pretend to be content with my life to please those around me. Everyday I get the glaring thought of death and killing myself. Right now Iâm trying to decide if I should wait for the future, or just end it now. "
"Talking to people makes it worseWhen I try to talk to people or become involved in anything socially, I just embarrass myself and my suicidal thoughts just get worse. Even little things make me seriously consider it. The other day I almost tripped over a chair and someone saw and laughed. I literally thought about killing myself for 5 solid minutes so I wouldnât have to deal with things like this anymore. Its pretty fucking stupid that I would ever end my life over a chair, but of course, life, uh, finds a way. 

Anyway, it really discourages me from going out in public because I know it will end like this. Being socially awkward and having ADD doesnât help. I always say stupid things and Iâm ALWAYS aware of the stupidity of what I say. And I seriously just do not ever improve. "
"I want help, but no one caresI don't have anyone to talk to, anyone to turn to. Anyone to tell me why I bother to live. Since I was 16 everyone told me ""it gets better"" I'm 19 now and it hasn't i just want to give up"
"Fuck man, idek Hey guys, my name is ----- (but you can call me badger) and im a 19 year old Canadian (No I dont live in an igloo). It is currently 2:47 am and in a grand total of 12 hours I will be moved into a newly built apartment with my best friend. I don't know why I'm writing this, probably just to clear my head/tell someone what's going on in my head without directly telling them. If you dont want to read this you dont have to, no one is forcing you lol. This shit is all over the place, sorry about that.

Honestly I should be excited about the next step in my life. It's time to spread your wings, or whatever they say. I've got everything a 19 year old could ask for, loving parents, good friends, a job and a car. But for the last few years I've been spiraling further and further down the abyss. Waking up is a task for me, I hate going to sleep because in my eyes that is accepting defeat of this day and the next is doomed to repeat the last. A few months back I got medically diagnosed as severely depressed, yet nothing has happened to change that. I try and hold my shit together with comedy and that's what I've been doing for the past 3 or so years to make myself feel good. I rarely find pleasure in any anymore, I do what the books say and put on a smile and fake it till you make it. That works most of the time but there is still the underlying feeling of hollowness. To get my brain to make me feel good I've taken up multiple hobbies that i enjoy, (warhammer 40k, dnd), but the main thing that's made me happy is seeing other people happy because of something I've done. So cracking bomb ass jokes times perfectly has been my go to. But that can't fix the fact of me constantly feeling like I am sub human, worthless and constantly second guessing myself. Because I joke all the time no one takes my seriously.  I told my mom that I got the results back from my mental health test and out of a score of 100 being the best and 50 being average, you'll never guess what I got. Fucking 3. I scored a 3 out of a total of 100 on a god damn mental health thing from my therapist. My mom didn't believe me when I told her I was depressed and even after she saw the test and was explain to by the therapist that I was at a high risk of depression, she was still skeptical. ""How could you be depressed, you always look so happy."" My mom owns her own business, but its failing, and my dad is a prison guard. In the 19 fucking years I've been alive I have very very few memories of my dad because he is always at work or sleeping or playing online poker. He was hit and injured in a car accident just before I was born, we have the money and opportunitys to get my dad the surgery's required to make him 100% again but because the fact he is now obese and refuses to lose weight is not able to. I ve never really had long talks with my dad, whenever we are on long drives with him it always feels like I got paired with someone in a class project that I kinda know but not really, so conversation is really limited. I hear hes a really interesting person from the story's I hear about him tho lol. My mom has always wanted the best for me but I always seem to fall short of her goals. Because I'm the oldest of me and my siblings I am the ""test child"" and because of this I am emotionally ruined (I cried for the first time today in over a year), and I have tust issues. She wants me to work where my dad works and has been telling me that I should do something law enforcement related all my life. I humor that idea because every time I say I dont want to, she asks what i was going to do instead and I'm always got with why any of those ideas are good choices and how I would make a great cop.i graduated from high school in 2019 and if done 2 classes at university for criminology 100 to get a degree to be what I refuse to be. And I've failed it both times. She wants me to be my dad, but I hate him and I dont ever want to be what he is. He as no life outside of work, hes a stranger to me who shares blood. I've never been good in school, I'm pretty sure I only graduated because the teachers didnt want me anymore. And that's fair lol. But Iv constant let me and my mom down regarding my grades. I was in French immersion for 3 years (grade 6-9) and that solidified my hatred for school and public learning. I'm a pretty big guy and I have played football for the greater part of 10 years. I enjoy it some times but the other times I wish I didnt exist. But it's gotten me through hard times with the family I make as a team. I've only had 2 girlfriends, the first one I really enjoyed but it was cut short for some bs reason and that broke me and that still has hurt me ever since, it's been over 2 years since the break up. The other one was 3 months of soul draining depression just for it to end with me finding out she's been cheating on me since the beginning. I found out on feburary 15th btw. So it's safe to say any form of emotion a person should have has been safely locked away deep deep down never to see the light of day. It deal with the stress of life and my problems I'm now addicted to nicotine (vaping). I have almost taken my life 2 times in the past 2 years but I reason with my self out if it. I have come to the conclusion that life will end naturally and that I should enjoy it and not end it. So as much as i would feel like i HAVE to end it i will never do that.

Today while i was going through all my stuff i did a lot of self reflection and holy shit yeah, my brain is fucked lol. I found some developed photos of me and my first gf and some friends from 3 years ago and, I would give anything to go back and relive those 3 days. Seeing all my stuff sitting in boxes really makes you realise the fact that nothing makes sense and your are just trying to keep up with everything. One friend got sucked back into a relationship with his crazy ex so I wont be seeing him, another friend is probably going to join the army so wont be seeing him, and another friend will be moving out into the woods and live off the land so wont be seeing him. I've tried to date again but everytime I fuck it up. All I want to someone there for me. Not a guy. A female that will take me seriously when I nee to be taken seriously, someone I cant truly trust with my emotions and feelings someone I can hold and be told every will workout. I have always been the rock, the ear to listen to a rant, a shoulder to cry on, and a source of advice, but there is only so much talking to yourself you can do before it gets repetitive. Because of these and a few more reasons I have hard times smiling. But, I have everything, I shouldn't be sad others have worse situations, there is no reason why I should be sad all the time. And that's just makes me sadder. 

Nothing on the inside, nothing on the outside 

In conclusion/ tldr 
The big sad fucking sucks bum"
"TV shows set in space don't deserve their stigma I wasn't interested in anything set in space until I finally played Mass Effect at the recommendation of a friend. That led me to shows like Babylon 5, Farscape, Firefly, and Battlestar Galactica. I have across people who watch Game of Thrones but are downright dismissive of this genre.

Space sci fi doesn't deserve it's stigma. What if instead of another reality show we dared to dream about humanity's future and space again?"
Just in caseI bomb my final again I'll take a rope and pills with me cause the only reason I'm studying is because my parents force me to. I've been struggling for years with my mental health and a disease and I'll be happy to go.
"Iâm really suicidal right now, could you help?Iâve had depression long term, roughly since 14 or 15. 

It started with bullying and getting attacked consistently at school for my appearance (I wasnât good looking, somewhat chubby, riddled with acne and my hair was basically skinhead.)

I had a bully called Levi who, on my first week, started a fight with me. This was warped by my school and they called my mum and told her that I was the instigator and I was the bully and I kept antagonising him. 

My mum waited for me to come home and when I walked through the door she beat the living crap out of me, until I was a fat sobbing wreck on the living room floor. 

When my birthday came a month later she forced me to buy him apology gifts with my birthday money that my grandad sent, since she refused to get me anything this year for being a supposed bully. 

I was forced to give someone who was still making my school life misery an apology card and chocolate as well as ask for forgiveness. 

This made the situation worse and he kept beating me up, until he was expelled. 

Then his friends blamed it all on me, and started to bully me as a group. 

At one point my arm was dislocated by one and I had to pretend I fell off my bike because they knew where I lived. 

A year passes and my mum decides to divorce my step dad. 

He tells me heâll still be my dad, but a month later says Iâm not his kid and refuses to speak to me. 

My mum gets into a relationship with a drug addicted, alcoholic and she partakes in his vices. This is where she picks up her heavy alcoholism. 

Almost daily they fight, and if I tried to stop them then sheâd attack me and call me names and such. 

My step dad comes pick up my half brother and sister one day and gives me my old desk, as I sit on the stairs before taking it up to my room she asks if I said anything to him. I didnât. She then accuses me of being loyal to him and calls me two faced and a backstabber and says Iâm scum. I cry and take the desk upstairs, and as Iâm up there I get an idea âIf I die, I donât need to keep to keep dealing with this.â

15 year old me goes to the bathroom and slits his wrists but doesnât cut deep enough to exsanguinate himself. He then goes downstairs to ask his mum for help and shows her the bloody wrists and she beats him up for trying to âmanipulate herâ.

Forward another few months, I turn 16. On my 16th I really feel no point in celebrating my birthday because of how depressed I am. I ask to be alone and say âI just donât care about it.â She accuses me of fishing for attention and starts to hit me and then her boyfriend just says to me to make a list. 

I write a small list. She forces me to write a bigger list. 

When she gets all of it Iâm forced to put it all into social media for others to see so they can see how great of a Mum she is. 

Through more months of abuse between her and her boyfriend she makes everyone move house so her and her boyfriend can move to his home city, because itâll make everyone happier. 

We move there and they still abuse each other, but this time the government has lost all of my School coursework and I get put onto a maths band where my level is capped at a C grade. 

I eventually get a girlfriend and a big group of friends who make me feel somewhat human. 

The local college is informed that Iâm good at computer science and building PCs and they offer me an unconditional spot on the Level 3 Networking course. 

Enrolment day for college. 
âKyan, were moving back.â

Iâd failed all of my subjects at school bar English and maths, my girlfriend still lived here, all of my friends still lived here, I hadnât experienced any issues here. 

She broke up with her boyfriend again and we had to leave. 

I get back to where we used to live. I get put on a resit course at college, because they wonât accept me without 5 GCSEs that are 6 or higher. 

My girlfriend now lives 50 miles away and we canât see each other very often. 

My little brother and sister are only allowed to come see us once every 2 weeks because of my mum irrationally moving so much. 

I canât take computer science again at college because they donât do it as a course. 

My mum now threatens to kick me out and leave me homeless if I cannot find a job and says âshe doesnât care if itâs too stressful on top of collegeâ. 

Iâve tried to get her to take me to a doctor and she refuses, she thinks depression is a myth and that the only way to fix being sad is going out and working. 

Sheâs just told me that the rest of my family fear me and that Iâm abusive and manipulative and I couldnât argue back or ask why because she then threatened to kick me out. 

Life feels so meaningless right now. 

It feels like Iâm a tragedy script and that I was authored to feel awful at all times.

Please help.  "
"We have a workplace training thing coming up and its making me nervous for no reason âWorkplace training thingâ might not be a very good description, but basically its this thing where you go apply to a place, and then you work there for a week instead of having school. Its meant to introduce you to what being at work is like.

I have some places im interested in, but it makes me really nervous for some reason. The places im thinking of applying to are: a kebab restaurant, the grocery store, and a hardware store.

"If THIS is what kills me, at least I can die laughingSo ... I accidentally stabbed myself with a pen a few minutes ago, and while I don't *think* I hit an artery, it did bleed a lot.  I excused myself as nonchalantly as I could, shoved some paper towels against the wound, had a ~~good~~ godawful cry in the bathroom about the circumstances leading to the stabbing, slapped myself around for good measure, and limped back to work.  It hurts like a motherfucker, and there's a good chance I'll get an infection from this, but I'm not about to see a doctor because, frankly, I deserve to die if this is what kills me.

Hope your Friday's going well!"
"What are some actual good reasons not to kill yourself?I'm at the point where I feel that I can't find anything worth living for - and I'm a fairly positive person as well, always trying to help others out, believing in the whole 'push through the hard times and things will get better', etc. - but now I'm just tired, and it's been this way for a while now. Number of calls to the suicide hotline is at a total of 5 just this year alone. 

Hmm, I'm not exactly a fan of the ""your family and friends will be devastated"" reason, or the whole ""someone loves you"" thing - I used to agree with it, but honestly, life goes on, no matter who lives and who dies. I can think of a few reasons why it'd be worth holding on, but they're all so... mundane. 

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has any reasons that may seem a bit better than the usual 'every day is a new day' type of stuff... "
"My mom agreed to suicide with me i cant beleive itOk so last night i busted out crying for the first time in 4 years, my mom came and talked to me. I told her everything, i told everyth8ng to you guys too in the last post, idk what guys im talking to but i feel better this way so i can trick myself to someone listening to me. Ok so i told her everything, at first she slapped me hard whem i told her about suicide, she told me im the only person she has in her life, (my dad is not a good person and her family is in another country so she dosent have anyone truly) so i calmed her and we had solid conversation and we came up with a real good plan. We are going to get out the pipes of our heater out so the oxygen can ran out and we suffocate when we are sleep, that is the best idea because there is no pain and we can die togheder thats the best. She told me she needs time to do somethings and next week we do it. Idk its wierd or not but im soo excited i never been this existed in so many years in my life.

I dont know if i should post this to /self or /suicidewatch, im going with sw because i think its more related to it idk."

"The loneliness is too much to bear and there's nothing I can do to hold this weight anymoreI can probably list every platitude I'm gonna get from this post, but here goes anyway. I've been in love a few times. It's an amazing feeling, I was engaged once, a long time ago. It's a feeling I feel so addicted to. I need it, I want it so fucking bad. Being alone is a daily torture, a daily struggle to get out of bed because I'm so fucking alone and so fucking depressed that I wish I was dead. If I died and went to hell it would be an improvement over this shitshow.

I need to love someone, I need to be loved.

""Oh, but aloneanddestroyed you need to love yourself before you can be loved and blah blah blah"" Yeah, I DID love myself when I was engaged. I felt like a whole human being, I'm capable, but it's hard when every day I have to deal with constant reminders that I'm alone and nobody loves me.

Now you must be thinking ""Well why don't you go out and meet people?"" because I have the social skills of a rock and the few times I HAVE met women they thought I was the most boring guy on earth. Or they just thought I was fat and ugly. (No, seriously, I've been told this multiple times.). Plus I'm broke, and am incapable of driving due to severe ADD, I'd crash my car in no time cause I get distracted way too easily.

So no car, no money, no job. Nothing of value. I mean hey, I can give moral support and love you and be there for you and all that shit but WHO THE FUCK WANTS THAT, RIGHT?!?

And now I sound like an /r/niceguys post, brilliant, more reason to wanna off myself.

""Get a job?"" Would LOVE to, but since I got blacklisted from wal-mart I have exactly three options in this town: Work for McDonald's for 8 hours a week at $8.50/hr, work for Burger King for 10 hours a week at $8.50/hr OR work for Taco Bell for 11 hours a week at $8.50/hr. (No, I am not exaggerating. I applied for these positions, I asked about wages and hours, this is what I got. And yes I have looked at other positions, they all want skills I don't have.)

I hate my stupid fucking life. I hate being alone. I've been trying to get better but it ain't fucking happening. I want out of this miserable city but it will never happen and I want to fucking die."

"Have any of you had a happy dream regarding your death?I canât count the amount of times that I had a daydream of my suicide/funeral. I even have journal that I write in sometimes where I described how my casket would look like. I can sit in class and happily dream of me jumping off a bridge or hanging myself. Itâs dark I know but suicide seems to be the only release for me. Iâm trying to give myself until 25 and if nothing changes/if my self hatred gets unbearable Iâll definitely go through with it (unless I lose it one day before I turn 25 and just do it).

"Where to go?I'm an American ex-pat who was working in Japan for a subsidiary/partner of Google.  


While I was fairly well to-do professionally, I was drugged and raped during a business trip to CES in January 2018. I was subsequently fired from my job (because while drugged, I apparently gave the key card to our show room to the rapists which resulted in stolen demo devices). Since then, there were other employment opportunities, but I haven't really recovered at all and just feel nothing. I don't even necessarily feel depressed. Just nothingness.  


For the past year, I hardly left my apartment. I couldn't bring myself to admit how bad my situation is to family or friends. 

I was googling painless suicide methods and it recommended I first call a hotline number, but I don't even have a phone any more. It recommended that I first reach out in some manner before making a final decision, and I agree with the logic that time wasted won't matter much if I do commit to this decision.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, my primary thought process is that humanity will be better off in the long run if I -- as a single person without any off spring -- don't contribute further to the problem of over population if I'm not making a true difference in society. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate outside input, as I realize that my experience may be affecting my judgment. I also would appreciate if anyone knows a way to contact a suicide hotline without being able to afford a phone."

"Well, Hereâs the Truth: An Introduction and ConfessionI suppose I might as well introduce myself which is kind of ironic because I love privacy. 

I am:

* Constantly afraid, suicidal, and my body is almost always in flight or fight mode, giving me high anxiety and insomnia.
 
* Living with a high possibility of having a chronic illness that has been progressing over the course of my life. In the past months the progression has been rapid. 

* Young and should be getting new experiences, making friends, doing what I love (biking, hiking).

* Currently unemployed and unable to do what I love-work as a CNA/LNA-because of lightheadedness, a high heart rate when up, and intolerance being upright.

* Resistant to medications. They often donât work or my body creates tolerance fast.

* Living with a learning disability that makes me forget the previous sentence I just read. I am also dyslexic. 

* Heartbroken. I lost someone I loved more than anything in the world. I do not think I will get another relationship like this, if I even get the chance to have another relationship because of my health.

* Lonely, feeling disconnected because of what I am going through.

* Exhausted physical and mentally.

* For now, still hopeful.

I have:

* Made an unsuccessful suicide attempt early this year.

* A second chance at the cost of physical health that is not related to the attempt. 

* No friends. I lost them all because of my mental health. I moved far away.

I was:

* Diagnosed  with major depressive disorder at 13 and have always had anxiety.

* Bullied in school

* An outcast

* Raped

I wonder:

* What I will lose next, my body is falling apart. Itâs now happening rapidly. Today, my fingers started to shake slowly uncontrollably. 

* How independent I will be in the future.

* If they will ever get to giving me a diagnosis in time. Iâm in that deep.

* Why I couldnât be grateful for my past health, why I took it for granted.

* if Iâll ever meet my dream of becoming an RN or even work again.

* If I will be able to meet and have friends again.

* Will I ever get better? I know it could and that other people have it worse than me.

If I could:

* I would stop going through this.

* Iâd be following my dreams and have the ability to do what I love.

* Ask for only one thing it would be for people to be kind and listen to each other.

On the surface I appear healthy, normal. Iâm not. Thereâs so much invisible about us and the people we interact with."

"I was told to post hereHello,

So I made [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/jwwh9/dae_have_suicidal_thoughts_on_a_daily_basis/) last night somebody told me to make a post here. 

So basically I've been having suicidal thoughts for a few years now - thoughts like how I'd kill myself, who would be effected, what if anything would happen to me afterwards. Never really crossed into serious planning, but at one point I put aside a bottle of Oxycotin and Vodka and hid it in my bookcase. It's made me feel really good to just have it sit there, but I have no plans to use it.

I don't think I'm depressed - I'll have my waves of bad thoughts but I'd say a good 80% of my day is me having genuine fun and being happy. 

I just don't really know where to go from here. I thought the suicidal thoughts I was having were as normal as people's murder/rape thoughts. Happens a few times a day but never anything serious, so no harm no foul, right? But reading some comments last night and this morning have led me to believe that suicidal thoughts are not normal, but I'm pretty confident mine are just thoughts and will never lead to actions.

Should I just go on with my life like normal?"

I have morphine, benzos, and alcohol. Reddit has been a great place to escape for me for the last year. I'm sorry to my friends and family that have to find me. Im sorry to anyone I've hurt. The world is a shitty place and I hope there's something better out there."

Pt 2 the mollusk 

[Verse 1]
Hey little boy, what you got there?
Kind sir, it's a mollusk I've found
Did you find it in the sandy ground?
Does it emulate the ocean's sound?
Yes, I found it on the ground
Emulating the ocean's sound

[Chorus]
Bring forth the mollusk, cast unto me
Let's be forever, let forever be free

[Verse 2]
Hey little boy, come walk with me
And bring your newfound mollusk along
Does it speaketh of the Trinity?
Can it gaze at the sun with its wandering eye?
Yes, it speaks of the Trinity
Casting light at the sun with its wandering eye

[Chorus]
Bring forth the mollusk, cast unto me
Let's be forever, let forever be free

[Instrumental]
 

Outro]
You see, there are three things that spur the mollusk from the sand (Yes)
The waking of all creatures, that live on the land (Yes)
And with just one faint glance, back into the sea (No)
The mollusk lingers... with its wandering eye (No)

[Instrumental]


Pt 3 polkadot tail 

[Verse 1]
Did you ever see a whale
With a polka dot tail?
Did you ever see a man
With eight fingers on his hand?
Did you have to dry your eye
When you saw that puppy fly?
Oh no
Tell me it ain't so

[Verse 2]
Have you ever tried to shrink
Like an ice cube in the sink?
Have you ever tried to see
What lies hidden in the tree?
Have you ever made a flan
And squished it in your hand?
Oh no
Tell me it ain't so

Billy-

[Verse 2]
Have you ever tried to shrink
Like an ice cube in the sink?
Have you ever tried to see
What lies hidden in the tree?
Have you ever made a flan
And squished it in your hand?
Oh no
Tell me it ain't so [Verse 1]
Have you ever seen a whale
With a polka dot tail?
Did you ever see a man
With eight fingers on his hand?
Did you have to dry your eye
When you saw that puppy fly?
Oh no
Tell me it ain't so

Help me-

Pt5 mutilated lips 

Verse 1]
I lick my brain in silence
Rather squeeze my head instead
Midget man provoking violence
Listen not to what I said
I said, ""Please calm it down.""
Everything is turning brown

[Chorus]
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this
Yeah, you wish
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this
Yeah, you wish

[Verse 2]
Laughing lady living lover
Ooh, you sassy-frassy lassie
Find me the skull of Haile Selassie I
Give me shoes so I can tapsy
Tap all over this big world
Take my hand, you ugly girl Chorus]
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this
Yeah, you wish
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this
Yeah, you wish
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this
Yeah, you wish

Pt6 the blarney Stone 

[Verse 1]
Get off my ass, ya wee bitty fuck
If I pull out the claymore, you're shit outta luck
Who is that girl, that pretty young thing
After I fuck her, she'll get up and sing

[Chorus]
Aye, aye, aye
Sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye
Aye, aye, aye
The Blarney Stone brings a tear to me eye

[Verse 2]
Down to the pub, for a two-shillin' ale
The bread on the counter is goin' stale
If I don't get some fresh bread soon
Gonna punch you in your face, and bark at the moon

[Chorus]
Aye, aye, aye
Sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye
Aye, aye, aye
The Blarney Stone brings a tear to me eye

[Verse 3]
Ain't got no girl, 'cuz I haven't the time
Got too many other things on me mind
Patty was nice, she was pale and cute
But I threw her away, like an old piece of fruit  

Chorus]
Aye, aye, aye
Sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye
Aye, aye, aye
The Blarney Stone brings a tear to me eye

[Verse 4]
Got tombs in me pores, my feet are all wet
Got mold in my ears, but I ain't dead yet
Got stones in me bladder, got a crack in me head
When Patty starts cryin', this is what I said

[Chorus]
Aye, aye, aye
Sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye
Aye, aye, aye
The Blarney Stone brings a tear to me eye 


Pt7 it's gonna be alright 

Verse 1]
Baby what have I done
Gone and left you all alone
It's hard for me to sing this song
We've been together for so long
I think I know what my soul's gotta say
And it won't hurt as bad someday

[Chorus]
It's gonna be alright baby
It's gonna be alright love
And if the mist ever lets the sun through
I just hope I did the right thing
For me and you

[Verse 2]
Guess I'm ruled by my heart
Built a life and I tore it all apart
It's just not our time
But you'll find a new love and you'll be fine
So many dark and lonely nights
But I believe someday I'll see the light

[Chorus]
It's gonna be alright baby
It's gonna be alright love
And if the mist ever lets the sun through
I just hope I did the right thing
For me and you
It's gonna be alright baby
It's gonna be alright love
And if the mist ever lets the sun through
I just hope I did the right thing
For me and you
For me and you

Pt8 the golden eel 

[Verse 1]
Sitting alone in the den
Watching the eel
Help me find my way home
Watching the eel
Burrows its head in the sand
Daylight has come
There shall be rest in a while
Daylight has come

[Chorus]
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel

[Verse 2]
Who can explain all these thoughts
Racking my mind
An endless barrage of shit
Racking my mind
The eel offered his help
I can't understand
Speaking its truth from the bank
Now I can see

[Chorus]
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel 

Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel

Pt9 cold blows the wind 

[Verse 1]
Cold blows the wind over my true love
Cold blows the drops of rain
I never had but one true love
And in Camville he was slain
I'll do as much for my true love
As any young girl may
I'll sit and weep down by his grave
For twelve month and one day

[Verse 2]
But when twelve months were come and gone
This young man he arose
What makes you weep down by my grave
I can't take my repose
One kiss, one kiss of your lily white lips
One kiss is all I crave
One kiss, one kiss of your lily white lips
And return back to your grave

[Verse 3]
My lips they are as cold as my clay
My breath is heavy and strong
If thou was to kiss my lily white lips
Thy days would not be long
Oh don't you remember the garden grove
Where we used to walk
Pluck the finest flower of them all
Twill wither to a stalk 


[Verse 4]
Go fetch me a nun from a dungeon deep
And water from a stone
And white milk from a maiden's breast
That babe ere never known
Go dig me a grave both long wide and deep
As quickly as you may
I'll lie down in it and take one sleep
For twelve month and one day

[Verse 1 reprise]
Cold blows the wind over my true love
Cold blows the drops of rain
I never had but one true love
And in Camville he was slain
I'll do as much for my true love
As any young girl may
I'll sit and weep down by his grave
For twelve month and one day 

Pt10 pink eye on my leg 

instrumental

Barking 

Moaning 

Pt11 waving my dick in the wind 

[Verse 1]
I'm waving my dick in the wind
I'm waving my dick in the wind
If it all goes right, I'll be in your arms tonight
But I'm waving my dick in the wind

[Verse 2]
I'm lost in the sauce once again
I'm lost in the sauce once again
If I make it through the night, everything will be alright
But I'm lost in the sauce once again

[Bridge]
It's been ninety-seven days since I laid my head beside you
And a million miles of highway in-between
There's some red and blue lights that are shining right behind me
And that pig's pretty mean, bastard

[Verse 3]
You should have seen old Jimmy Wilson dance
You should have seen old Jimmy Wilson dance
Give that boy a dime, and you could have a chance
To see old Jimmy Wilson dance

[Bridge]
(Dance, Jimmy
I'm doin' the best I can, right there
That's it
You know, I can't really dance like I used to. I mean I'll try, but I'm an old, old man now)
I've got a real good feeling 'bout old Jimmy Wilson
Sure enough, he's got what it takes
Do another number for me, please won't you, Jimmy?
Cause you're a real good dancer
(Ooh, yeah, cut me down!) 

[Verse 1 reprise]
I'm waving my dick in the wind (aa-oo-aa)
I'm waving my dick in the wind (aa-oo-aa)
If it all goes right, I'll be in your arms tonight
But I'm waving my dick in the wind
Waving my dick in the wind
I'm waving my, dick in the wind 

Pt12 Buckingham green (my favorite from the album currently) 

[Verse 1]
A child without an eye
Made her mother cry, why ask why?
She kept her child clean
On Buckingham Green

[Verse 2]
The children saw the eye
As a sign from God descending from the sky...
It was alright to dream
Of Buckingham Green

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
""Summon the queen!""
Spoke the child of eye, ""It's time to fly.""
Turning fire to steam
On Buckingham Green

[Verse 1]
A child without an eye
Made her mother cry why ask why?
She kept her child clean
On Buckingham Green

Pt13 ocean man (fun fact mourning glory from pure guava was gonna be used in the end credits of the spongebob movie instead of this) 

Ocean man, take me by the hand
Lead me to the land that you understand
Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe
Is a real trip
Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement
At the oberman
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth
To the childlike man
Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
Ocean man
Ocean man
Ocean man
Ocean man, take me by the hand
Lead me to the land that you understand
Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe
Is a real trip
Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement
At the oberman
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth
To the childlike man
Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
Ocean Man

Pt 14 a she wanted to leave 

Three men is all they were.
Three men out at sea.
Three men came aboard my ship and took my true love from me.
I couldn't believe
She wanted to leave
She wanted to leave.
I loved you so long.
Since you were a child.
I've cared for your every need.
I've tried to make you smile.
And all the while
You wanted to leave
You wanted to leave.
Go gather the guns.
We'll blast them at sea.
She begged for me not to shoot,
""For my true love is here with me.""
I've never loved thee
Now I must leave
Now I must leave.
So go fetch a bottle of rum dear friends and fill up my glass to the rim.
For I'm not the man I used to be
Now I'm one of them.

Pt14 b reprise 

Slowed down instramental version of dancing in the show tonight"
how is it already 1 am bro it was just 12 come on
How many pull ups can you do I just did a set of 6
Sit on my face And suffocate me pleas thank you
My thoughts sometimes I wonder how it feels to be dead and escape my depression. to see how it feels to put a gun to my head and blow my brains out thoughts that came to me ... I suffer from depression from a broken heart and not able to be my firstborn child and it hurts me so as the time thick the end will get near yours truly K's ..........7th/6/20
"Giving up on everything, i want to end my lifeEverything started with my family. When I went to middle school my only sister left the country for her boyfriend (she left 10 years ago, when i was only 11). By the way i have 4 more siblings that left our home earlier. I've never had a support by me, everything by my own. 

I have lost contact with a friend that got fired (the same job) because of alcohol. I called him many times but he didn't call back. We actually have met few times before he stopped responding to me. The last thing he said was:
""i will call you if i dont forget it"" - it was 3 months ago,  he just stabbed my knife, i did so much for him.
 I don't know what to do. I miss him so much, we had so many moments. I dont believe that he doesn't give a damn about me.

I've been drinking alot and actually trying marijuana to get rid off all the problems: family, work, stress, no time to do anything.
Now im feeling f****ng empty inside. dont really know what to do.

Friends? No thanks. (i deciline every person who wants to be on my ""friends"" list. I dont know how to talk to strangers.

Online games and alcohol make forget all the troubles.

I've benn feeling suicidal, want to hang myself to end my pain. No one will understand that. I have to hope, no friends, no future.

Just giving up on everying

(hanging myself is my solution ;/"
"I'm not really scared of killing myself anymore,...I just have this eerie calm feeling. The only time I still feel fear is when playing out the suicide in my head. I guess it's almost time."
"Anyone here just need friends because they dont have any IRL (or just someone to talk to)Even before the pandemic, i had no IRL friends. I aways thought i was boring, but alot of people think of themselves that way. I am down to get to know some of yâall if you need a friend oe anything"

"How my boyfriend deals with knowing Im suicidalIs it normal that my boyfriend treats me like I don't exist, doesn't pick up when I call him like EVER (in 4 years of dating), doesn't text me first to ask how my day, or answer when I wanna talk to him and doesn't make an effort to see me. Last year I tried to commit suicide and he is the only one who knows about it. Thankfully I'm okay physically but not mentally. Not at all. I know it isn't his fault but I can't help but imagine if the way he treats me is normal to a mentally stable girlfriend and most importantly for a girl that is full of anxiety and pain to heal from. What is wrong with me? And why does he act like he doesn't care?"
"Why am i not happy? I'm not unhappy either, why is it i feel this way? Did all of the choices i made throughout my life led me to feel te this way, or was it just meant to be. Idk i might be having an existential crisis, or maybe i just feel lonely. Idek what im trying to get out of this post anyway, this prolly weird"
"TIL: Alexithymia + Depression is a lethal comboI've been diagnosed with various conditions grouped together called Alexithymia, which I have had for quite a while now.

A year ago I entered a severe depression (I was forced to leave my job to see my dad before he died), I lost everything financially - and have not been able to grieve at all.

A few days ago, I finally get told by professionals that there is no treatment available for my depression due to the Alexithymia.

This is bad news for me, as for the first time in my life I've had suicidal thoughts (twice in the last 6 weeks). 

Given that I actually want to live (but don't have any mechanism to really live at my disposal), this worries me (much like seeing a cancerous growth on my skin). 

My questions are these:

1. Things are going downhill fast - how long before suicidal thoughts turn into anything worse. Do they necessarily turn from thoughts into actions ?

2. Given I have no money, no friends to talk to about it - and now no treatment, where to now? Do I just wait until the day comes where thoughts become deeds ?

3. My last psychiatrist tells me that Alexithymia is counter productive in group therapy environments, I've seen that backed up on various sites. Is this necessarily true ?

4. Given I my alexithymia means that I'm going to end up alone and destitute - is there really any point fighting destiny ?

Thanks

PS: Apologies in advance, but one of the effects of my condition is something called 'imprinting'... it may colour how my responses look to you, it doesn't alter the fact I appreciate any help you can give me."
"Update: Suicidal IdeationsHello, I posted a while back about thinking about committing suicide. I did try, my mom found me and I went to the hospital mental unit and stayed there for almost two weeks. I came out a much better person. I still have suicidal thoughts and my depression but I'm not in the dark place I was when I first went in. Also, a lot of people are scared to be put inpatient. Firstly, it's usually short term 1-2 weeks tops depending on your hospital. Most hospitals have a psych unit. Every one I've been to have  been great. You have groups and medicine usually. But also a lot of free time. The nurses are usually amazing and if someone's not you can report  them if you have to. At mine, we had a social worker to coordinate with the outside world. So if you have rent or bills to pay while you're there you can do it. It really isn't that bad. It's not  optimal but I've never experience  the abuse others have said can happen. An  I'm sure it does happen in some places, but I would say not as often as you think. I just wanted to say that so if you're  considering it but are scared, it does help. Anyways, now that I'm out I'm going back to my therapist but as well as doing partial hospitalization, where I go to groups from 9am to 3pm.  It helps so much. I feel like I can fight this. Thank you to everyone who messaged me and commented, it means so much that people care. Thank you. Ps I'm on mobile so sorry for any weird formatting or spelling errors."
"Suicidal without being depressed?Is it possible to be suicidal without being depressed? For about a year now I've had this feeling inside that everything would be better if I was dead. Most of the time I just feel like a load to those around me and I can't really help it because I'm not really good at amything and usually end fucking things up. I get to thinking that if I died right now, I don't think anyone besides my mom would care and I'd be doing her a favor in the long run. 

All that being said, I don't think I'm depressed. I can see the beauty in life and I would really love to travel. I can still laugh, joke, smile, feel good. I have a couple of friends that suffer depression and I really can't compare myself to them. I still go out, I have a normal social life, and nobody not even my closest friends would be able to tell that this is how I feel. 

I don't think I'd ever attempt to commit suicide but it's just the thought of doing it feels so tempting. I can't really trust this to anyone, my mom would freak out and I don't think she'd be of any help, and I don't want to worry or shock my friends, and most of all I don't want people to think I'm doing it for attention."

ahhh so iâm 19 iâm officially old i have one year left on this sub ahhhh so sad
What to do?Been suicidal off and on for 30 years or so. I'm currently on disability without health insurance. I think I've hit a point where I really might kill myself. I've isolated myself from everyone but my wife who I've been trying to get to divorce me for two reasons. One being I don't want her to find me dead and the other being she's the only reason I'm still alive. My parents are dead and I've cut off my family. I have no friends anymore. I'm just hopeless. My life is nothing but pain physically and mentally. I don't know what to do. I was on zoloft which numbed these feelings but also every feeling to the point I just sat here staring at a wall all day. I still thought about suicide but I felt almost nothing so it didn't matter how much my life sucked. I'm going to shut up now because there's no point to this. I'm afraid.
Shout out one time to my fellow jews! We just be vibin im going to spend the day with my girlfriend and her family since they celebrate Christmas! Have fun everyone merry Christmas!
"i have nothing leftIm unemployed, depressed and I have no friends here. And i miss my sister so much. The side-effects from the anti depressants are killing me, i can hardly sleep and food doesn't taste anything. And now my girlfriend baled on me, the only person that makes me happy. Suddenly she just doesn't care anymore.

People are just so fucking selfish. I wish i was more selfish, but somehow i manage to prioritize others before myself. Yet everyone just leaves me all the fucking time.

Im trying to convince myself that things are gonna get better but i just can't see the light. It's so dark everywhere. Everything feels hopeless and i feel pathetic. I haven't cried like this in years...

"Need someone to talk to for some advice. I have suffered from depression since I was 16. At this moment, I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality. I honestly feel like the things around me aren't real, and my head feels weird. I'm going to talk to my parents now. If anyone here has experience with this, I would be really, really glad to have someone to talk to on aim or msn tomorrow (Wednesday). 

I'm not going to commit suicide, but everything seems too weird right now. If you're there, please send me a PM and post in the thread to let others know someone has messaged, it would mean a lot to me. "

"Almost Died TonightI've never had such intense feelings until recently. Was on this subreddit while I was at the bar earlier this evening. About 30/45 minutes later, I'm outside walking home. Standing a little to close on the street. A van came so close to knocking me into oblivion. I flinched. 

Moral of the story - I'm not ready. I think about it all the time, but in reality I don't want to. It's time to figure out how to deal with these feelings the right way."
"Is anyone there?I'm done. I'm so ready to give up. I have everything ready. I'm so incredibly weak that I can't even lie down in the bed I made. I'll be doing everyone a favor. I won't burden them anymore. It's so stupid though. I""m never going anywhere in life. Fuck I'm even to lazy to get simple schoolwork done. There's no place in this world for such a fucking failure like me. I'll stop disappointing everyone and I wont hurt so fucking bad anymore. Everyone wins. But I need to stay. Some people put some misplaced trust in me and now I'm stuck in this hell. I want to tear myself to pieces and cut until there's no clear skin left but I lost my blade. Fuck. Is anyone there? Does anyone really care?"
"I posted here about a month back and things have changed...So I bought a gun last month. A used HK USP. I'm not depressed as I was when I was in university but the idea of having an life ejection button keeps my head level. Yesterday it dawned on me that I don't have anything in my life that keeps me going. I don't like talking. I have a major bipolar and anxiety disorder. I'm anxiety average redditor I guess, I have favourite subs and participate in discussions. I do have a steady job I think. I don't really have hobbies that I do regularly. I've never thought of suicide until I bought the gun. I did buy it for protection purposes. But now I feel like suicidal thoughts are crossing my mind constantly. If my day goes bad I feel that I could just head home and end it. It kind of feels like a weight in my head. Sorry my mind is all over the place as I'm typing. I'm starting to see all that's wrong in my life. What I'm basically asking is, ""How can I stop this way of thinking?"""
"Got a DUIA few years ago I was fucked over by the Army hard. Reprisal got me kicked out and now I owe over $70,000. It really messed my life up and my mind. Recently, I went thru a breakup with my long time girlfriend. Now I got a DUI. I can't afford it and it practicality destroys all the plans I've had.

I'm a Christian and I have hope in God's plan, but it's looking pretty bleak. But at the same time, without my faith I would have bit the bullet a long time ago. This just really pushes it over the edge. I'm usually pretty resourceful and can usually work things out, but for the first time in my life, I don't see a way through... And that's terrifying. I'm not sure what to do."

Im sorry for what you're about to feel. Im sorry i couldnt be the son you and dad wanted me to be.


Dad- I was going to start this off by saying ""fuck you"" for leaving me and mom by ourselves.

But at this point it isnt even worth it.

You quite literally made your bed and i dont feel pitty or remorse for the guilt i hope you feel when this is all over.

maybe you went through something that changed you. You were an amazing dad growing up.

Then you changed.

You started losing your temper, stopped caring about the business you grew into a small empire.

What happened dad?

and why do i have to ask this now when ive tried to ask multiple times and you brush me aside like a piece of shit.

Sorry..but fuck you dad


So there it is folks.
My goodbye letter.

I dont really want to go into details about what led up to me taking 40 vicodin 10 minutes ago but i dont see a way out.

Maybe there is a way out..maybe i could have gotten out of this.

I just dont care now.
I cant take the pain any more.
I cant take the stress.

I'll respond to comments here for the next couple minutes i guess.

There's really no point now though.

YALL KNOW WHAT IS Unfair?????? When your brother is more prettier than you :(
"Can you wake up while falling if youâre on sleeping pills?If you take pills then fall off a cliff, would you wake up or would the pills work the whole time? Would it work even when you hit the ground? Would it cause painless death?"
"I never wanted to die, until I realized I had nothing to live for anymore.Iâm 37, with 2 boys, one is 20 the and baby of his own and the other is 13. Iâm 10+years into my 2nd marriage. I donât want to do this anymore. One person can look into the beautiful glass house and say my life is perfect, and visually it is, but behind the curtain itâs anything but. Iâve been gaslit into sacrificed my own mental health for my spouse and eldest child whom are both certifiable narcissists and I am so emotionally spent I donât have the strength to pull myself out of it. Everyday for the last 3 years Iâve woken up in physical pain, like Iâm coming down with the flu. Iâve lost/gained weight, I have spells were I canât sleep at night, or Iâll sleep for days so I donât have to face anything. I had hope until recently, when my youngest son was still living with me. He decided he wanted to live with his dad though and I couldnât even bring myself to beg him to stay. What kind of person puts their burdens on their childâs shoulders?! I know heâs never coming back. My eldest son had a baby in February and due to Covid I was stuck on lock down and couldnât travel for 3 weeks and then once I was able to they didnât want me to meet my granddaughter. I was the absolute last person to meet her anyways. Itâs a long story but to shorten it up, he stood me up on 3 different occasions and promised heâd spend a weekend so I could meet her and bond a little bit and when the time came they barely spent 5 hours with me over 4 days in town. It broken my heart naturally, but I kept my mouth shut. Unfortunately I couldnât hide the sadness on my face and it upset him and his girlfriend. They screamed at me, called me selfish and ungrateful they had other plans and didnât even want to allow me to see her. Iâll never measure to her family since thatâs whom they live with. Theyâve cut off all communication and I havenât even seen a picture since Fatherâs Day. I tried at first to apologize, but I didnât ask them for anything so I donât even know what Iâm supposed to be apologizing for so I stopped. I donât hear from either of my sons now. Theyâve always been my light even when I thought the world was hopeless, they always give me a reason to push through. Iâm lost without them. Iâm in total darkness. My spouse is no friend. I donât even know him anymore. Heâs a master manipulator and no matter how many times Iâve tried to leave before heâs always managed to scare or suck me back in just to inflict the maximum amount of pain and anguish on me. I donât blame my children for not wanting to be here or around him. Itâs my burden to deal with. I made this bed Iâm going to die in they shouldnât have to suffer for my bad choices.

Someone once held a mirror up to my face and told me about myself and the cruelty of the words they used have never left me. As bad as it hurt coming from this person, they werenât wrong. They told me I was trash and thatâs why my father didnât want me, and why my mother abandoned me. Itâs because I am trash my family didnât love me. They told me eventually my kids would come to realize it and theyâd discard me too and that Iâm I going to die alone. No matter how you dress it up, trash is trash and nobody loves trash. Nobody respects trash. You use it to benefit yourself and once it no longer benefits your needs you dispose of it!

They werenât wrong. Iâm an empty shell of my former self. I hate myself just as much as they all hate me too. I have nothing to show for 37 years nor do I have any legacy to leave behind. Iâve never came close to measuring up to their unattainable expectations. Now, I donât have anything left to give anyone let alone myself so I am useless. Why didnât I reach out before it got this bad? Because there was nobody to reach out to. Itâs been months since Iâve seen anyone, heard a friendly voice, and txts barely get replies. How do you even broach this subject? The weight of this amount of trauma and pain is so hard for me to live with how do you unload that burden onto somebody else? Doesnât everyone struggle? Doesnât everyone have their own shit to deal with? I am barely noticed now. It doesnât seem like anyone would be losing much. Iâm not even present in my own life as it is. My letters are written now, my plan is all laid out. I never wanted to die... until I realized I had nothing to live for anymore."
"Pedophile soon to be father of two. Feel stuck, tired, scared, and hanging on by a thread financially.First off, I need to start by stating I have fought off suicidal tendencies for a long time. I have attempted twice before and had thought I had them in check. They aren't.

Second, I am a pedophile. I have been attracted to underage girls for my whole life. It's not exclusive, my wife JD, is attractive. It's not my real cravings. I am the father of one boy, and we have one baby on the way. I have gotten very close to not being able to stop myself before and this scares me most.  A few years ago through some good and bad luck I came extremely close to be arrested for downloaded child porn (there was an investigation and a questioning, luckily I had encryption). That lead to the second suicide attempt.

Third, I'm very close to being fired from a job that I hate for reasons that were my fault. This I can't talk about too much for anonymity's sake. I only have self taught skills with no external verification of then (degree, certifications, etc). If this happened then our family's prospects are close to zero. We both make ok money but not enough to keep us afloat if the other didn't work. I will not be able to get another job making nearly the same amount of money.

Fourth, I desperately want to get help for the pedophilia and some other distressing mental issues, like paranoia, panic attacks, depression, social anxiety, constantly being tired, suicidal thoughts and generally not being able to focus. If some of these issues However there's something nagging in my head that if I do go for help it will be reported. I have mental health insurance, which is not the thing holding me back, I'm worried that some information will ""leak"" and people will find out. I would ask a doctor about the rules regarding the disclosure of their records, but how do you ask ""Do you report people who are pedophiles and are concerned that they may act out thoughts?"" without telling them?

Subconsciously I think I'm trying to eat myself to death and have gained 40 pounds in about 3 months, the extra weight is making me more depressed.

Paranoia is really strange, it's not that an authority is out to get me. It's that people I know and love are constantly manipulating me, even if I can otherwise know pretty well that they aren't.

Anyway, I feel myself getting close to another attempt... I've chosen car crash into a perfect I-beam on a bridge. No date yet. When I have a date is when I know I'm serious. 

Sorry for the long post, and even if everybody tell me just to go do it, I'll be glad I have been able to tell *someone*. 

This is a second throw away account, so I won't be checking it constantly. Maybe tomorrow."

"This is the endI'm transgender MtF, I recently learned that I can't afford my hormone treatment anymore which is really heartbreaking, I've wanted to start the treatment since I was 16, I'm 21 now I've been 3 months on it and I really can't afford it anymore. It just feels like getting out of my house and working for it was for nothing, after starting the treatment I haven't attempted suicide, but now I'm just tired of all of this, I've literally asked money to my friends for food, for my appointments and to pay for my treatment. 


But at this point I'm tired, I don't want to deal with this. So this is more like some sort of goodbye, I'm really really tired of everything, of abuse, of abandonment and of everything my parents have said to me. I wish things weren't like this. I was supossed to start healing now and I really don't want to deal with this anymore.


So I'll see if I can die tomorrow. I really don't want to live if I can't keep going with my treatment, suspending it would be enough to make me attempt suicide again. I also should be on a higher dose of the medication I'm on and it's expensive. Last week I had to ask money to be able to eat. And now I'm tired, I'll just pay for rent, do some things I enjoy and die... This is over. My life is over. I really don't want to keep on living if I'm not taking my treatment. 


So goodbye, hopefully death is just nothingness and it's not reincarnation, because I don't even want to live a life as a cisgender girl. I just want to be dead and stay dead forever."

"My reputation must be building. I got banned in two Discord servers and just muted by this one admin in a server just now for mistakenly using the âR slurâ when I got a bit frustrated. I got called âan unstable, annoying douchebagâ when I didnât try to start an argument. I pretty much have social problems and Iâve been insecure which is why I wouldnât think before I do something, so I have few friends and have a building reputation.

"Left/Right/Up/DownIt's amusing thinking that in but a few minutes it's Father's Day yet here I sit, by myself, kids gone, ""wife"" downstairs. MS has straight up fucked my whole life over. In the past two years I've gone from energetic and with it to gone enough my wife has asked for a divorce. I can't blame her. I get it. I agree. I no longer have the energy that I used to. The things I used to love wipe every bit of energy I can muster. My kids shorten my fuse to no end.

I had a great time today in Boston drinking with my wife. I felt I could be honest, and straightforward.  As the nights worn it's gone downhill.  As my energy waned my care, my wanting for normalcy has taken a nosedive. I sit here wondering do I take things further into the deep end? Do I go, on all the possible days of the year, to a final restful(?) end, snuggling with my favorite cat? Do I just go to bed and sleep it off? What  is it that I actually want?

Why can't I just be happy with what I have? I realize I'm way the fuck more fortunate than most in this world. Can't that be enough? Should that be enough? What makes life worth it? I feel like everything is objective and subjective at the same time; like I can have all, be all, accept all.

Fuck. Everything."
"Suicidal thoughts tendencies are triggered by my demented grandparents.Hi /r/suicidewatch,

**PS: I may sound like the worst person in the world, but please hear me out.**

I used to love my grandparents, but currently feel indifferent to them. They have ruined my life for the past years. I used to love them, but they're such a burden to take care. I have classes to study, I have a body to work out, and I have a life to live.

These people are both suffering dementia. At the beginning, I was concerned and took care of them. I ""walk the talk"" in terms of taking care of them and sacrificing my gym days, library days and possible volunteer/employment opportunities I could've gone into.

Unlike my siblings, I passionately took care of them: prepare their food, gave them medicine and washed my grandfather's fucking smelly, dirty ass. My siblings are half-assing taking care of them--they don't even do their house chores (I wash their clothes, too). I am the only person who actually took care of them. I want them to die right now for my own well-being.

I know what you're thinking: I am a bad person who deserves to be behind the bars &amp;/or be in mental institution. Right? I understand.

All these times that I took care of them I just wasted. I want to kill myself so that I wouldn't have to take care of them. All of my problems originate from them. I've been stressing out because countless times, my parents always asks me to stay because I have the ""easiest program"" (Criminology) studying in University. I've explicitly told them numerous times that I can't concentrate at home--this lead to accumulating work load from school.

I used to be muscular too, with some enjoyable extracurricular activities. But these fuckers had to ruin my life. I am now fat because of these fuckers. I currently in debt of $20,000 in student loans. I've failed and dropped classes before because I have to stay home. As it turns out, there's barely any job in Criminology diploma. My life is ruined. I'm 21 years old, and not getting any younger. My peers from highschool are beating me in life all because they're lucky that their grandparents are dead.

I haven't accomplished anything substantial, academically. I don't want to be that guy who lives in parent's basement because of these fuckers--interrupting my schedules, University-life balance and all. 

I'm sure as fuck that no border security or police institution will hire me as soon as the psychological screening takes place. I used to be happy too, ya know.

I have no one to rely to. Everything's a mess.

I feel like I'm at my limit. I'm smiling to mask the sadness off my face. These fuckers better die before I actually kill myself. My suicidal thoughts are increasing. Please help me."
How do I tell someone Iâm sad?I want to tell someone who cares about me without them calling the cops or making it a bigger ordeal than it needs to be. How do I go about telling someone that I feel like living is pointless? I keep hearing people say stuff like âtalk to someoneâ but who and what do I say?
"IM SO BORED I HATE SCHOOL AND MY FAMILYMy family is stupid!! they see me at home all day, just doing school WHICH I HATE and just browsing the internet WHY HAVENT THEY SAID ANYTHING?!

"I wanted to share that i'm no longer suicidal.Sure, I'm still depressed and I have thoughts of suicide, but I have found a reason to live. My girlfriend is my drive, she is my motivator, I am grateful she is in my life and has chosen not to leave. Eleven days from now marks our one year anniversary and I couldn't be happier. So instead of planning out suicide, my thoughts are focused on paying off my credit card so I can meet her in person again. Because if she leaves, that's it. I won't be able to go on. I won't kill myself, but I will give up on anyone and everyone. I will never find another like her. I will spend every last cent I have, max out my credit card and go homeless until I die of starvation or get arrested. But hopefully that never happens."
Why does every hotline hang up on me.I don't yell. I don't threaten. I try to stay as calm as I can even when I'm panicking. I just want help.
"Nearly 40 years in, haven't found any place, nobody talks to me, nobody loves me or even thinks about me. There is literally no point in keeping myself alive.I can't find joy in anything because I don't have anybody to share anything with. People come in and out of my life peripherally but I never learned how to make lasting or meaningful connections, and nobody wants them with me. Nobody thinks about me, nobody cares about me and I don't care about myself. I just feel so much pain and misery from loneliness and the emptiness of my life. There is no hope anymore. 

If there was an off button to my life I would have already pushed it. Instinct against hurting myself is the only thing keeping me alive right now, but rationally I know that killing myself can't be worse than this hopelessness."
How is anything worth itIf I hear one fuckin person say suicide isnât worth it Iâm gonna flip my shit. What the fuck is in life thatâs worth so much more? Iâm just so fucking done man I donât know what Iâm supposed to do. I worked in school and never learned proper studying cause it was easy so now Iâm failing college but even if I pass college I just get to work endlessly till I die and make no impact on the world and be forgotten. I genuinely donât know what Iâm supposed to do or how Iâm supposed to think anything is worth the effort it takes. The only reason Iâm even still alive is my base biological fear of dying
Im bipolar and i went off my medsThey were making me feel so down. I stopped taking them and today i felt amazing but i quit my job because i had a delusion that i had 124000 in the bank. I went on a glider today and then went 4 wheeling out to a mine in the desert. I keep hearing people scream terrible things at me and it scares me. I am just glad i am living again though and my head is so much clearer.
"Sharing your happiness with others. In latest months my life improved, and i got myself into a different mindset and ask if there's somebody who thinks the same as me.

We all know that world is full of toxic people, and some of them are just filled with greed and disrespect for other people success.
Lately I've improved almost everything i could, money, relationship with parents. Finally found somebody who loves and respects. And this actually got into some thoughts that changed my mindset.
Now I'm just kinda scared to share my happiness to other's, because i know that some greedy people can try to ruin it.
For example even though the fact that i have a girlfriend i don't really mention it in different conversations, or share it with people i actually trust. The same with money, i have money but i don't spend them on things like expensive clothes, or something that shows your money to other. And it's not because i can't afford it, it's because I'm scared to share my happiness with the world.

I just wanted to know your opinion.
TL;DR I'm scared to show my happiness to others because of toxicity and greedines stored inside of people."

"girlfriend having serious suicidal thoughts (sorry if this is the wrong place for advice from someone who doesnât have suicidal thoughts)iâm 15(m) and my gf (15) has been having suicidal thoughts the past year. we started dating this year so i havenât known her for so long since i just moved to this district. iâve asked a couple of her friends and theyâve said sheâs self-harmed twice and has had these thoughts from the SECOND GRADE. i havenât been able to sleep thÄ past couple of nights and me and our friends have tried convincing her that committing wonât solve any of her problems. she does have serious depression from dating a guy who then dumped her five days later for thÄ âschool sl*tâ. this broke her. according to her friend she cried for days and was extremely quiet Ã­Å class. eventually she got over him and started to develop a love for someone else. but he never liked her back or even paid attention to her. and on top of all this, she has no living grandparents and her parents are constantly arguing and have mentioned divorce. they are very hard on her since she sings, dances, and plays an instrument. eventually when i moved to thÄ district Ã­Å thÄ beginning of thÄ school year, we started to talk a lot since we were Ã­Å some classes together and i eventually got a bit of a crush on her. my friend subtly told me she likes me as well by screaming it Ã­Å thÄ hallways. she says that being with me has made her happier than before since iâm thÄ one person who genuinely loves her. a couple days ago her mother found out about us dating and told her to break up with me. she eventually told me that she wonât do it but thÄ stress broke her even more and she left for two days on âk imma go kms nowâ.  she came back and said her mom stopped her and that they went to a therapist. i never got an update on how that went. my friends and i are running out of ideas and iâve decided to turn to reddit. please help me."
"Idk. Help, I guess.So Iâm an 18 yr old girl/woman and Iâm having suicidal thoughts. I donât really like talking abt these things with family cause I donât wanna worry them. Iâd rather talk to you guys cause you dont really know how shitty a person I am. I have a good support system, although my dad recently had a heart attack he survived and is back home recovering. I recently started a job as a pharmacy tech and I hate it. I canât quit though cause I need the money. It makes me feel utterly stupid and useless, as Iâm an anxious slow learner. I can feel those trying to help me getting annoyed. Iâve had a few minimum wage jobs over the years but this is the first âcustomer serviceâ one Iâve had in a while and I remembered how mean people are. I canât seem to do anything right, and I feel like thereâs something wrong with me. To top all tht off, I graduated hs and I never really had any real friends there, but I havenât made any college friends either, which I guess I hoped would happen. I have depression and have asked my parents if I could start getting therapy but they said itâs too expensive. Iâve always been kinda quiet but Iâm academically outgoing. This job is so depressing but honestly itâs not like I didnât have depression before anyways. Idk. Everyone and everything just sucks. If you even read all this, thanks. Lmk if you have any thoughts cause I donât anymore."

so in this time i will try my best to change and afer every day i will make a check in one of two columns i draw in a paper good and bad, if i had a good memory it go in the good column and if i had a bad one it go to the bad column and i already started.
and i thinked  of the way i will kill myself and the place."

"i dont know what to put for the title but i'm absolutely miserablei am a 17 year old closeted transgirl, victim of multiple acts of sexual violence (more than I can count) at the ages of 7 and 8, and have social anxiety and some sort of depressive disorder (i have also been labeled as ""pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified"")

my life has been made more difficult due to sexual abuse in the past, but recently i have been struggling with my gender identity and sexuality. i am a junior in high school and have a couple of friends but my relationship with them is not very meaningful. outside i have very few others who i do consider to be people that i have ""meaningful"" relationships with but they are much less accessible as they are a bit further away. so i spend most of my time outside of school alone.

recently the only thing on my mind has been suicide. all i can think about is how i'm going to do it, when i'm going to do it, where etc. I can't go for more than 15 seconds it seems without having some kind of suicide related thought.

i go to therapy (i have since i was abused,) have attended LGBTQ+ groups and all that stuff but there are a number of issues with those. i don't want my parents to know that i am feeling the way i do, and i am not sure if they will learn through my therapist. i also have found that i cannot connect to many people at these kind of lgbtq+ groups as many people seem to be studied eccentrics and honestly rather immature. 

i never have felt like i could assimilate into society at school. i have been called into the principal's office because i was suspected of being a school shooter last month because i opened up about feeling isolated on my personal facebook page and someone felt that they needed to report that. that only made me feel worse.

i just dont know what to do and know that i will not survive much longer if life continues the way it is."

I feel ready to end it for the first time ever this morning.I don't have much else to add I just feel fucking done.
"Ok I'm so pathetic. It's time to end it.You know what I did with my life?

I got an inheritance of 200k after my parents died and wasted it all on rent, studying, cigarettes and weed over the course of a decade. I smoked so fucking much and only ate garbage so I gave myself cancer. I had the sweetest girlfriend and dumped her like a piece of garbage. I didn't achieve anything because I had my inheritance and didn't feel pressure to work. I wasted my whole life and will die soon because I gave myself cancer. I'm 28 and my life is already ruined.

I texted my ex-girlfriend and she hates my guts now. Tells me I'm a loser and a whiner and she doesn't care if I die. She's right.

My miserable existence needs to end. There's no hope for me."
I cant believe I tried to kill myself last saturdayIt still feels like a dream. I drank a half gallon of alcohol and almost chugged pills but passed out and was unconscious i couldnât breathe on my own. My ex found me unconscious.

I was mad when i woke up yelling at my mom after they took the tubes out saying why did u save me.Everyone knows itâs serious but iâm just like was it really a big deal?

"Just want happiness, no barriers, stabilitySorry this will be long. I don't feel like myself and I have been depressed for quite some time. Sometimes more than other times. I was divorced over a year ago, while I was married it was the first time I seriously thought of killing myself as I was driving, angry &amp; just stuck in the moment because I did not see a solution to the problem. I knew then what I was feeling was very real &amp; it really woke me up. I was then living alone &amp; working a dead end EMS job. I ended up in an unhealthy relationship shortly after the divorce, oddly enough he ends up being one of my best friends who has helped me through a lot as I did the same for him &amp; gave me a lot of insights I was looking for. Though the intimate relationship was never meant to be. 

Fast forward a bit and I lost my job, had to move back in with parents. Moved back to my home state &amp; saw my old doctor who prescribed anti depressants &amp; told him I had previously held a gun to my head but set it aside &amp; called the hotline. While I was still living alone &amp; working my crappy job I had went through several episodes of intense suicidal thoughts, then suddenly I am fine &amp; happy go lucky like I usually am. 

Tonight I learned my sister got engaged, 2 months ago. It made me happy for her &amp; at the same time I started bawling because neither of my half siblings ever talk to me &amp; it makes me so sad &amp; upset. They're growing up so quick but most of the time I never know what is going on because they never reach out to me. We used to be so close &amp; I had partially stepped in for parenting. I feel they were a little jealous of me because I grew up in a different home with loving parents. For the past few years it feels like they try to show me up, my brother had torn me down before when I simply just told him I was proud of him. I have gone through a series of bad relationships, some my sister thought I had the perfect life &amp; she wanted the best for me. But they weren't meant to be. Now my sister has gotten engaged to a guy she's been with for a long time, it's very sweet, he treats her very well too. It makes me so sad &amp; I'm mad at myself for not feeling more happy for her. Seeing happy couples photos on Facebook makes me sick &amp; very sad &amp; mad, but I do love hearing stories. It makes me wonder where I stand in their lives, brother &amp; sister. After my divorce, my sis &amp; ex were still facebook friends til I asked her to unfriend him. She would post relationship posts &amp; my ex would comment Amen &amp; she would like it. It was a stab to my heart. Now I feel bitter &amp; have been for awhile. I just want to be happy. 

I just got a new full time job back home, in the psych unit of hospital where I handle a lot of suicidals ironically. I'm also working with victims of sex crimes &amp; domestic abuse part time &amp; a volunteer EMT ironically. Things are looking good, just feel so alone &amp; depressed. Like I'm unworthy of anyone's love or marriage.  "
my arm fell asleep shush
Almost thereNear the end of school i was thinking of how i was gonna kill myself my mind became calm strangely enough after all the horrible thoughts. I started to think 'today im gonna do it im gonna take some pills lay on the couch and never get up again and everyone will think i was taking a nap' it was the closest I've gotten to doing it i felt too guilty to speak of it to my friend since i feel like ive bothered her enough and i dont want to make her feel guilty. Theres not enough pills
"Every thought.I'm currently riddled with anxiety and the can't even.  The only calm to any of this is the yearning for deaths door.  Why am I thinking like this, it can't be healthy but fuck am I in a fuck ton of pain.  The worst emotional pain I have ever been in.. I don't know how to be above it, it's been constant for the last two months. "

"Almost thereI think I'll do it. I haven't talked to anybody about it (sometimes I tell suicide jokes, funny ones I think). I closed all my social media accounts, logged out of the forums I frequent, even I'm trying to sell everything from the hobby ive had since 2000. I'm trying to sleep all day taking pills (not to overdose, justo enough to sleep) and I think I'm ready. This past weekend I slept around 18-20h per day
Last summer we went on vacations, though about it when we were at the hotel. It was really high but didn't in the end (I thought about my wife, dying on vacations would have been shitty for her)
So far I haven't done it just for my wife, but I feel like I'm getting there
Obviously I have doubts, I'm trying to make a pros and cons list, what better place to start than black txt on a public forum"
A thoughtSometimes I wonder if I just killed myself maybe people would care about me. Maybe they would realize how much help I really needed. Maybe they would realize Iâm not as strong as they think. Sometimes I think thereâs no other way to get that message across.
Am I suicidal if sometimes I think dying wouldn't be so bad?I don't think of myself as suicidal but a lot of times I wonder if it would be easier to die. 
"Help with a Halloween costume (idk where else to post this) Hello!


So I have an idea for a Halloween costume, but I need help finalizing it.Â 


What it's going to be is a skeleton skull painted on the face and neck, a fedora with a small red stripe going around it with a rose on it.Â 


For the clothes I want the torso to be a red button-up shirt with a black/grey vest over that or a black button-up shirt with red suspenders on.Â 

For the arms, itÂ´s either red/white gloves or skeletal hand design on gloves or painted on.Â 

The legs will be black dress pants, no belt, and black dress shoes.


I am open to ideas of any kind and I personally am leaning towards the red button-up shirt with the vest and white gloves. The costume is meant to be fun and not exactly scary. If anyone reads this, thanks. Any help is amazing, and have a good night!!"

I need helpI've been suicidal since I was in my lower teens and it was spotting until now. I just out my fiancÃ©e of 6 years had sex with someone else and really liked the other guy. I know some would say this a dumb reason to do it but if you know how much she meant to me you'd get it.  I've alone in my apartment with our dog for 2 months so she could go out of state for an internship. And now I'm on vacation with my mom and step dad and her and I hate it. I don't see any reason to live anymore. I don't see a future for me and I haven't for awhile. Idk what to do...
"Suicide hotline hung-up on me.After spilling my guts about how sexual abused turned into  PTSD and depersonalization/derealization disorder and how that has ruined my life and how I turned into an alcoholic. Me and her talked for a while then all of a sudden she put me on hold and when she came back she said ""sorry I should be more professional"" and then hung up and then I heard the phone buzz (when someone hangs up on you).

We spent like an hour on the phone together so I'm guessing her quota was up and that she was forced to go to the next ""customer"".

Like wow.

Excuse me while I drink myself to death.

You know what I get it the world doesn't revolve around me people need help more than me but you know what I'd rather someone say ""Hey our hour is done if you need help call the suicide hotline again, i need to go, best of luck"" instead of some fucking bullshit."

I have been much better lately I started going to therapy and overall have just not wanted to die constantly. These past few months have been bad though. I almost constantly want to die, I know I should die, but this is a tipping point. At this point I am only a burden to those around me. I just waste money that could be going to my sister and my mom. I just canât anymore I constantly am fantasizing about death and how nice it would be for me and those around me. I just donât know where else to go."

"Honestly, don't know what to title this.I'm 16 years old. I used to be smart, athletic, etc. I've been suffering from severe depression (albeit not officially diagnosed due to my parents unwilling to take me to the doctor) for about 6 years now. I always question what I am doing here. I do nothing productive, my grades are slipping, I find it hard to find the energy to go to school. I suffer from insomnia, and always have to wake up early the next day to go to school. I sit at home and play video games all day, usually alone so I can just listen to music as I play. 

My life has been great honestly, and that's why I hate myself so much more. I've had no problem finding girlfriends (although I've been cheated on 3 times in my 3 relationships). And while they are ""high school"" relationships, there was still feelings and other emotions involved. My parents have been great (albeit they are a bit insensitive). They provide for me well, they get me a lot of the things I want, they make sure I stay out of trouble. Just, they don't believe that for me, in my situation, I can be depressed, so I haven't talked to them in years about my situation. What also hurts me is the near daily talks about how my grades are slipping and I can pick it up cause they know I can do better. And all I can do is nod my head and tell them I'll try harder, even though I'm trying as hard as my mind will let me, and I know that I am just letting them down. 

I feel like I am a person who is generally ignored. A lot of times when I am talking to my friends in a group, they will communicate alongside themselves and if I try to talk, I generally get ignored. I'll usually repeat myself 2-3 times to see if anyone notices but many times I just get ignored again. I find myself raising my hand a lot in class for help but just being ignored by the teacher, whether they are talking with a student at the time and forget to check on me, or they just straight up think my questions are stupid.

I feel as if many people find me being around them enjoyable. I have a temper, I joke around a lot, never really serious. I tease a lot..I don't really know why.

One of my best friends passed away recently and that hit me hard. It hit me even harder that many people have been disrespecting him after his death.

I routinely get harassed by people in my school, whether it being them calling me names (i.e Faggot, dip shit, retard, etc) and I only have one friend that I can truly say I could talk to but I don't ever talk to them cause I am afraid to disappoint. 

I've talked to the suicide hotline and honestly they weren't helpful at all. I got to talk but it never truly helped so I stopped calling.

I have zero interests in pursuing any real job and I want to go pro in a video game I play but there is 0 chance of that happening due to my temper and it would stop me from ever making it on a team, plus the fact that I suffer from carpal tunnel. 

Another thing that has happened in my life is that I was forced into sexual situations with one of my exes, and physically abused if I didn't comply (scratching/nail digging mainly) and honestly nothing has made me feel more like a bitch then that relationship because I realized that I had a free out when she cheated on me but I still realized I liked her. I wanted to forgive her cause I believe people deserve second chances. And maybe the fact that I thought that she was the only girl I could get due to, in my opinion, shitty looks and bad personality.

I'm planning on sneaking out tonight, taking a nice long walk outside where I know I will end up dying of hypothermia or just freezing in general. I think it would be nice to maybe walk and then watch some of The Office (great show by the way, it's stalled me from ending it a few days ago because I want to see the moment Jim and Pam get together). Freezing to death seems fitting due to it matching the cold, sinking feeling I constantly have in my chest. I don't plan on leaving any good byes, although I guess this could count as a signing off, to any friends or family. Maybe I'll tell one person tonight and see if they can convince me but quite honestly I just don't see myself enjoying my life at all for at least the next 10 or so years and would much rather just end it now instead of suffering 1 more year with these thoughts.

I understand that I am young and that this is a harsh decision, but at this point I've cracked under the pressure of depression. Years of it eating at my thoughts, putting me down, causing me anxiety. It's enough, this has to stop. I put this off for way too long due to me being afraid of hurting others but at this point I need to realize that I am just going to grow up to be a fucking let down.

TLDR; 16 year old bitch, good life, bad mental. Giving up. Nobody's going to read this or care.

Signing off,
Alex"
I'd love to post my story here but I don't have the energy to type it outI know nobody cares. But yeah. Maybe I'll finish this another day. Does anyone feel the same?

"Shit just gets worse and worse.I donât have an income anymore because I was laid off. Iâve applied to every freaking grocery store and no one has called back even though theyâre supposedly desperate for workers.

I had a pretty popular post in this sub a few months ago about how I was sick of people telling me it will get better. Still people tried to convince me. Now fucking look. It didnât get better. It got fucking worse for everyone. 

Iâm fucking done"

"Sorry. This ended up being a bit long.I'm sorry if my writing is incoherent. I've never written this out before and I don't really know how, but I feel the need to. Every fibre of my being feels like it's screaming out to die.

Ever since I was 6, I've displayed tendencies of depression. My childhood wasn't exactly normal, but I don't think it was that bad. I feel strange talking about this so normally, but I've kind of come to terms with it at this point. All I can remember is wanting to disappear - I don't know anything different, and I have no hopes or ambitions. I do everything out of pure convenience to make my life easier so I have to do less. My whole life, I've felt as if I am trapped in a dark cloud where time is moving slowly yet all at once at the same time.

I'm 16 now, and I think that when I have to become fully responsible for myself, I will die. I procrastinate constantly and the start of every new day makes me want to cry. Death isn't really that appealing honestly - I don't want to hurt people through my suicide but sleeping forever seems to be the only way to rid myself of this responsibility. I don't want to be too selfish, I'm a shitty enough person already. In primary school the concept of time was so foreign and blurred to me that I could just stare at a wall or sleep to do it, but everyone wants too much from me now. 
Procrastinating used to make me feel better as it put my mind off how shit I felt, but not anymore. I thought that not being sad was happiness, but it's really not, it's just indifference. If I lived a life where all I had to do was sleep, that would be heaven. I do want to be responsible for myself, but the very idea of work makes me break down and lose all energy. I guess I've given up.

I suppose it's a little bit beside the point, but I've started starving myself too. Not completely on purpose, sometimes I do it because emptiness gives me something to feel, but sometimes it's just because I just don't have the energy to eat. I don't think I have an eating disorder though, because there's no real reason behind it, I could probably stop at any time if I wanted to. I mean, I displayed similar actions as a kid as I'd eat 5 chocolate bars at once just for the hole it seemed to fill and I guess I still get the tendencies but I stopped that. I just want to feel something real again and even though I know this won't solve the problem, it makes me feel... something, at least.

I'm afraid to tell someone, not because of any possible stigma, but because of my own self-doubt. I am afraid that if I try to get help, I will be told that everything I am feeling is normal and there's nothing I can do about it because I've been forcing myself to appear normal for so long. Sometimes I wonder what would be worse - finding out there's something wrong with me or discovering I've been wrong all along. Every time I gathered up the courage to try when I was younger, all I could think about was all the adults who told me that because of my age, I couldn't understand real problems and that led to a real fear of being labelled an attention seeker. It's been 10 years since this started but I still feel like I'm stuck in the same place I was then, and I haven't advanced at all. At 10 I barely stopped myself from stabbing myself, and I honestly don't think I'll be able to stop myself now. I wonder if I'm still in the same mindset as then, really.

Apart from telling others to try and get professional help or whatever, it's not like I haven't tried to fix this. I've tried lots of methods but none of them seem to work. I just don't have the energy or patience. 

This was a bad idea to write. I feel worse than I did before now I've thought about this more, as if I'm just wallowing in self-pity. I'm sorry if you read this far, because I really don't think I'm strong enough to help myself. "

"Coming out to my parents AKA the most awkward moment of my life So, a while ago I made the mistake of telling my parents that I'm bisexual. HUGE mistake on my part.

First for context, I gave them a little test a few years prior when I started to realize I was also attracted to the same sex. I asked both on separate occasions; ""Would you still love me if I were gay?""

To her credit, my mother seemed kinda surprised but smiled and told me that of course she would still love me. My dad on the other hand answered ""I would still love you if you had cancer, wouldn't I?"" For what it's worth, I think what he meant to say was that he would love me even for something that was out of my control.

When I actually told them a while ago that I was bisexual and seeing a guy, they kinda lost it. Before I knew it I was getting asked questions like ""How many guys have you had sex with?"", ""You mean you're gay?"", ""Have you never slept with a girl?"", ""What do you think *turned* you bisexual?"" and ""But you don't know *for sure, right?*"" ð¤¦ââï¸

At one point my dad even laughed cause he assumed that I was joking. My mother also insinuated that I was just going through a phase. 

When I took it a step further and told them that I was seeing someone, from that point onward they only ever referred to him as ""my friend"". They continuously said that I should ""trust them"" and that I would ""grow out of it""

To this day I make it a point of avoiding any discussion that involves my sexuality with them like the plague."

My mother has BPD and living with her is so hard, her comments are really hurtful, but I don't have anywhere else to go. My father isn't really present, but he's been trying to be closer to me after I've tried to overdose about 3 weeks ago. I've dropped out of college two times alredy, currently unemployed and I feel like I'm failing at life. Everyone has it kinda figured out but me. Also, my boyfriend left me today after I tried to stand up for myself and tell him that some of his actions hurt me. I was hoping to work on this problem to make our relationship go but he didn't want to compromise at all and would rather let me go than try to work on the issue.

My newest self harm method is to wait until the night before to do all of my work and torture myself. Then the next day I fuck up my tests since there's no way that my mediocre study habits will ever give me a good grade, and then I feel stupid. Then Iie in bed all day because I feel terrible about myself, and push off my work. And the harm cycle continues.

I'm not stupid. I got such good grades until I started to burnout from all the pressure I put on myself and slip back into self deprication and depression. I know I'm capable of doing well in life if I just gave a damn about what happens to me, but I don't. It's all for nothing. So what if I do well in school? Then I get to go to a nice college and be around stuck up rich nerds? And then I get to work a 9-5 for 50-60 years until I retire and then die? What's it all even for? Why shouldn't I just give up if my life is just going to be another average experience? There's no point to it all. And before you tell me that I can make it cool and fun, quit the bullshit. You know full and well that 99% of people are gonna end up average and never do anything actually important. I'm not gonna be apart of the 1% that makes it, I'm already boring. So that's it. That's what makes me want to quit."
"oZeppy's (sometimes shitty) online school tips **These are NOT life tips, it's a joke. Don't sue me.**

1. Log in late to assert your dominance
2. Don't be a dick to you're teachers, some of them are people too
3. Record the class, notes are BS
4. If you use google meet get the ""Visual Effects for Google Meet"" extension
5. Browse reddit like you might be doing right now
6. Get sleep
7. Even if it hurts your ego, pretend your wifi is trash
8. Don't be afraid to do anything during class with you're camera off (yes, even that)
9. When ever you have to turn on your mic play Never Gonna Give You Up
10. Cheat (it's easy now)
11. If you're using google meet join  with incognito tabs and have fun
12. If the teacher's wifi glitches take the chance to leave (if you even joined)
13. Use all the cheats you know from the old ways of school, they still work
14. Grind Minecraft instead of homework
15. If you don't do the work you ""lost it""

If I find any good ones I'll add them with credit to the creator."
"I know thereâs no other way for me to have peace of mind.Itâs so hard. I have pure obsessive OCD and Iâve been obsessing about this for about a year and a half now. I never understood suicide but it clicked for me. The only way I will ever have peace of mind and stop feeling so anxious and tortured is when I die. 

I have two reasons not to make this happen myself, my husband and my dog. Itâs still so hard."

"Girls can be simps too So this is something that happened to me a while ago where I was simped on

During the trend where we would take selfies of ourselves, I decided to join in and post myself (I deleted the post after this) and not 10 seconds later I got a dm from a throwaway account saying the following word for word: âhey 15f. Ur hot af.â Now I wasnât really creeped out by this. On the contrary, I was flattered, so after school I thanked her. Then the next morning, at like 6:30 AM she told me to talk to her on kik. Now I didnât have kik, and when I told her she insisted I got it, so I did, even though it says itâs 18+. Afterwards I added her, and she said she wanted another pic of me. I declined, because I wasnât even supposed to be awake yet and I was too tired, and she sent a picture of herself (she was wearing clothes donât worry), and I noticed that she didnât look 15. She probably just looked older than she was, which is pretty common, but I wasnât gonna take any risks. I deleted kik, went back to Reddit and blocked her account. 

Thereâs other examples of people simping for me, but you get it. Iâm not saying all girls simps and trying to defend boys acting like simps to be an incel, all Iâm saying is that everyone can be a simp on the internet regardless of gender."
"I hate it when people tell me it gets betterI mean yeah, these sorrows will go away at some point but they will come back with more of their kind. They always have and they always will. By going away for a short time they give me the false hope that things would get better in the future but I know that they won't. The only thing that would stop these feelings would be a bullet in my head. I've been living like this since I was 13 and I can't take it anymore. I hate myself. I hate the person I am. I hate the way I act and feel but I know I can't change anything about it. Everyday the thought of suicide becomes more real. It's not an abstract wish anymore. I daydream about various ways of committing suicide all day every day."

"what i would like to tell my parentsDear person who loves too much, give it all for me, I never lost hope, who wants the best for me and asking for my every day since before I was born,
I have a confession to make to you it is from the heart. And it's the last thing I want. And I feel very selfish.
All this has me in a state of confusion and guilt.
On the one hand I feel useless and selfish because being aware of what I have I can not repair. And you think that my ""problem"" or ""condition"" has no qualms. And I know it is. But I can not confront and I can not solve my problem. And every day I want. But every failure days.
It's something that happens to me for a long time. Before college. Even from small.
Wishes to escape from the house to the point of making bags. Desire to end it all, to the point of writing letters saying goodbye all. I felt as a nuisance and as a weight.

I hurt myself. I thought as ways to end it all. And this comes from long ago, but he was always there close to you and those feelings did not last more than one day. But now being in another country, away from you despite talking once a week the feeling became more unbareable. I just wanted to stop feeling.

I learned that when I ate so much I had a hard time breathing The only thing I felt was that it was full. So When I stopped feeling stuffed Eat again.
What happened? I gained weight. The weight is very superficial. But that has been a problem for me since childhood. And then I learned to get rid of what they ate. I have purged. And I have taken laxatives.
And when I did not want to eat to not gain weight? I learned that sleeping pills without hunger kept me because I could spend hours sleeping without feeling and without eating.

The truth is that throughout this semester have not made any friends. I have not gone out even once except the trip to Chicago. And all this has me very anxious. It has cost me hours of sleep. I will go to class with anxiety because I do not like to see people or talk to them
I do not want anyone to see what I really am. A very good actress.
Sorry. I apologize, you who love me so much and do not want to me to be feeling like this. I have no reason to feel so. And every time I see around me I feel worse because I have everything and yet I can not stop feeling this way.
I did not want disappoint you. you had so much faith in me. So many hopes. And I let you down. I just wanted you proud of me. Being here and being the best.
But this is a call for help before it gets out of my hands ask you to give me your hand and do not trust so much in my when I say I'm fine.
 sorry for wasting you two whole years.

"Hi, I'm sad and in need of money so help me outHi, my name is Max Martinolich. I'm going to tell you why I'm here today.

&amp;#x200B;

So, a couple of months ago I was dating this girl for about 5 months and she was the love of my life. I found out that she had been cheating on me with multiple people and it angered me to the point where I lost control. I ended up hurting her more than I wish I had but it's too late. I took it out on her and I hit her in the head with a shovel but I didn't know I did it too hard. I thought she would wake up, I kept shaking her but no response and she stopped breathing. I told my dad about it and he helped me bury the body in the back yard but for some reason it had felt like time stopped. I wasn't scared anymore, to be honest I liked the feeling and thought I needed to rid of witnesses. So at night I grabbed a kitchen knife and sliced my dad's neck open. I wasn't able to move the body because he's so heavy so now he's just laying there... cold and lifeless in his own room.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This happened at 4 months ago. Since then I've been selling my now dead ex's nudes under the twitter Khloe11821523. She's 16 and has a banging body so if anyone is wanting to buy some pictures contact me either by number: 9852494371 or please visit me at 720 Woodridge Boulevard Louisiana and we can discuss business."

"Shameful revelation that I probably donât want to dieSo basically Iâve been doing a lot of inner work recently and honestly things have started to turn around. I come from a reasonable family with a reasonable back story honestly nothing big. 

The thing is anytime I see anything that reminds me of the possibility of suicide or self harm it just becomes an overvalued idea that I canât get rid of. Iâm also ashamed to realise that I probably donât want to die, but just really want to take a good long sleep in the icu and wake up to find everything magically sorted out for me. This shame is honesty getting quite overwhelming and i was just wondering if anyone has any advice at all regarding the shame and this probably romanticized idea of suicide?"

"How should I do this? Iâm pretty sure that she likes me, and I want to ask her out. We donât live in the same town, 30 miles away, and transportation is a problem. I want to ask when we see each other irl but I donât know when that is, so over FaceTime seems to be the best option. I really like her, and really want to ask her on a date when all of this calmed down. How should I ask her?"
"I WANNA DIE EVERYDAYI can't even encourage my friends who tell me randomly that they wanna die not to do it or listen to them. I just tell them that we should do it together. This has been years of battle but makes things easier as well because whenever I think something fails in my life, I can just die. I am also not afraid of death.

letâs try to have a good day *try* &lt;3
How did you react when you first learned Santa wasn't fucking real? I was devastated. I didn't eat or sleep for three straight days.
Hanging myself this morningI cant take it anymore. Everywhere i go i feel like i dont belong. This anxiety has been following me around since i was 6 years old and the moment i open up to my parents about it they look at my like im a nut case. Im 21 now i have had enough of sitting around and watching everyone else enjoy life while i sit in the corner fantasizing about killing myself. Therapy has done nothing. My parents think im a failure and a nut job. I dont even know why im on this earth. I have considered killing myself since i was 8 and now i have finally had enouft of being treated like a sub human born with this painful disease. People day to rationalize my reason for life but i have been doing that foe years and things have only gotten worse. My life is a living hell hopefully on the other side god takes pitty on me. I just cant do this anymore.
"My friend knows that I want to die and doesnât seem to careSo apparently my friend knows that Iâm having suicidal thoughts yet she never asks how I am. 

She is very self involved anyways and usually only talks about herself. But you would think that when it comes to something like this she would actually care. I guess not. 

People only care once youâre gone. So why should I stay alive for these people when they donât even try to support or care while Iâm here."

"My friend's story. **She is not on reddit because her parents think social media is addictive (Bad addiction) so this is her story I will be posting this in parts or edit it in the future.**

They over estimate her ability as a person. She has migraines which is getting worse and she believes that her parents think she is faking it.

She first started to notice it back in 2019 she had just moved to a boarding school.

Whenever she asked her parents for a new notebook or marker or any stationary they used to tell her they were tight on money.

But when she went to school they started buying things like crazy, her room became a storage unit for things they didn't even use and got her brother new toys they said that this was their way of coping with her being gone ""Retail Therapy"".

(Which she and I both agreed on it being complete Bullshit)

They visited her once every 10 days which she thought was very sweet of them and if they weren't able to her Grandfather (May he rest in peace.) would.

One time they promised her that they would visit her on  a Friday. They didn't come and didn't picked up any of her calls for a week  she panicked because her father's health was unstable at the time she was worried if something had happened to him.

Finally after ten days  they picked up and told her their car broke down but didn't gave any reasons for the calls.

They just said that her grandfather will come visit her on Sunday. And that's it.

Later on she cried, her principle(An angel) comforted her saying that they just might have network problems. And let me tell you she never cries in front of people.

**This is the only part that she wanted me to write she will tell the rest later if there are people willing to listen.**"
"Chrome stiletto dead womanHeya, I just wanted to whine like the wind. I feel fried and fictitious. I get more feral every day, I feel like a lunatic. I donât know if thereâs something horribly wrong with my brain due to my synesthesia. I get overwhelmed in the sensorium every day, my chest is invaded with death. I will only stay alive for my divine boyfriend. I despise wealthy people. I know itâs irrational, but they have so many plushy resources and sanitized lives. They havenât had to steal to eat like a pauper clutching their knee socks. Flying by the seat of my pants. I truly donât know whatâs wrong with me and Iâm awful confused and scared. My relationship with colors and language is kaleidoscopic and I find it horrible attempting to communicate normally. I want to thrash my body everywhere. I should have stayed in ballet. But I prefer lifting iron weights . I am too emotive and bizarre. Iâm too childlike and I believe nearly everything Iâm told. Iâm at my nadir, here. I despise the rich people that are ruining the earth. I hate them so so absolutely much. Iâ wish I could commission some carrier pigeons to peck their eyes out and chew them like raisins. Anybody with dead eyes, Iâm afraid. Theyâre like invaders. My boyfriend has a dreadful immune disorder and heâs the most beautiful lambent man, heâs only ever helped people. Iâll be at his side no matter what. Itâs infuriating to me that my boyfriend and other kind people are suffering so desperately and the structure of this sicko place wont give them access to the facilities and assistance that rich people can âafford.â The swoon of the injustice is hardly peached and phosphate fizzy. I donât know whatâs going on Iâm just trying not to drown beneath the ocean foam of my fury so I donât die. I want to hurt them. I know this all sounds awful, I just donât know how to explain this. Iâve been raped many times, Iâve been beaten many times,I got off of opiates, I have ptsd from that part of my life. Iâm only 23. I feel hapless. I depend on weed edibles to sleep because I have insomniac fits otherwise. Sorry for bloviating thank you. I know that itâs not the fault of anyone born into a rich family, I canât help but feel frustrated though. Itâs been so difficult to assimilate to regular society for me."
"I found out through reddit that my husband has been lying to me about wanting children.hi,

im very much in need of medication for ptsd. ive been lied to, cheated on, called a liar, and lost all of my friends because i cant be bothered to be friends with people who think those things about me.

my husband has been my rock for over 5 years. i found out he cheated on me last year, and haven't (even with therapy) been able to stop social-media-tracking the people he was with. it kills me every dumb-ass day. the woman is not attractive at all and everything about this absolutely crushed my self confidence.

as stupid as me staying with him is (i need to become more financially stable first before i can leave, but i want to die more than i feel like going thru the effort of leaving), we had never planned for children until 2 years ago. he was the first person that i ever wanted to have kids with, and we spoke of it frequently once we breached the topic, but knew we couldn't until we had saved up more. he was always excited about it. well, the social-media-tracking has escalated to him, too and i found his reddit account and saw a post from a few months ago saying that the idea of having children disgusts him.

im just...done. i have nothing and no one. i dont want to get knocked up by a cheater in the first place, but what if that didn't happen, we'd followed our 'dreams' and had a child/ren.......would he have loathed them and me forever?"
"I'm willing to end this but I shouldn'tI'm going through a lot of things, haven't been out of my house for some time and I don't want to anymore. My mother is alone and she lost my father last year. I would've ended it a long time ago but I can't do this to her.

Life is meaningless, I broke up with my girlfriend as well about 10 days ago since it was just going downhill. I tried to distract myself with a lot of things. I haven't done any work in over a month and I'm soon to be facing my seniors for it. Either tell me how to do it quick or tell me how do I get out of this. I can't live, or I can't live like this. I've killed my future with my own hands and now I'm willing to kill my present."
"I just wanna share this So I went to the store to buy some groceries for my mom and everything went well until i got to the self checkout section and paid and when my change of 18 dollars and 68 cents came out of the machine it made this ""flit flit flit flit flit"" noise as it was ejected from the kiosk and i popped a boner right there because of how beautiful the cash flitted out of the machine and the sound it made o my god someone please help me i have a new fetish"
"I'm done.This is it, reddit. I'm done.

I cannot, no, REFUSE to live this bleak, sad, miserable existence that some would call a life. I am nothing more than a a piece of walking, talking, breathing human trash.

I got a 1.3 GPA my first semester in college. I have become an utter disappointment in my family. Not only to my family, but to my fraternity brothers as well. This group of men would jump in front of a fucking bullet for me and I can't even meet a required GPA minimum. I view that as being the biggest, most useless mooching piece of trash excuse for a human being.

I have been dealing with all of that, but the story that follows blew the top. Beware of extreme vulgarity and cursing.

I have been off and on with a girl since I got to college. And when I say off and on, I mean that she would get drunk when I was on sober driver duty, beg me to buy her food (and apparently I am way too big of a fucking pussy to say no), and then she would demand that we go back to my room so she could ""sleep"". And by sleep, I mean beg for me to fuck her, even though I repeatedly told her I would not as she was intoxicated and I was not. It's a moral thing. This would always end with her forcibly ripping off articles of clothing from my body and essentially forcing me inside of her.

And then? She would ignore me. Until the next time around. 

I fucking love this girl. I love her. And every couple of weeks, she tells me she has changed, I take her back hoping for that to be the truth. It never fucking is.

I don't ever want to see that useless, trashy, fucked up disease ridden cunt again.

And since i'm too big of a fucking pussy to stand up to her, i'm doing the only thing I can to ensure that I never, ever, see her again.



EDIT: I talked to friends, as well as the suicide hotline (They fucking suck, seriously. Bitch put me on hold. Logically, you probably shouldn't put a person who has nothing/nobody to live for on hold, forcing them to listen to your shitty hold music.) I have calmed down, and am back in my dorm room. I haven't slept in 86 hours, so i'm hallucinating pretty bad right now, so i'm going to try to sleep."
"so I was thinkin'... since my stepdad is around 40-45 years old and doesn't smoke, we can assume he'll probably live past 60

so, *hypothetically,* if I kill myself before I reach the age of 30 and he lives past 60, then he would outlive me.

and since he's the oldest in the household, *hypothetically,* that would make me the first person in this household to die instead of him, the obvious First-to-Die candidate

well that's crazy :l"

"I dont want to waste peoples time anymoreI wish i was never born. Ive fucked up so badly so often it feels like all ive ever done was waste peoples time and ruin their day.

I wish i could say i feel like this bec im abused or whatever but my family is alright. Theyre not perfect, far from it, but im so lucky to have them anyway. My best friend is the kindest, sweetest person ive ever met and all of my other friends are just great, lively people.

I feel like im dragging them all down.

My mom would never admit it, but her life went to the shitter when she had me. A promising engineer that just got shot down because of an unplanned pregnancy that tied her up with a shithole of a husband.

She works so hard to support my stupid jobless ass and all she asks is for me to find a job with medical benefits but i cant even do that because im too stupid and hardheaded to land a job at a place big enough to afford that kind of support.

My friends are always so kind but everyone knows im the dumbest of the bunch. The ugliest and whiniest too. I never do anything right and my luck is so bad its fucking legendary to the people who know me.

My best friend is so sweet im so sorry i keep wasting her time. She deserves so much better than some stupid fuck who cant keep a job or even try to pursue their dreams because theyre not even good at the thing they love to do. Shes the brightest, kindest star in the universe and i know i cant give her all the love and positivity i should.

Getting up every day feels more and more like smashing my head on the pavement but i cant even end it all because i know theres gonna be somebody out there whos gonna have to deal with my ugly obese corpse and i dont want to ruin their day too.

I wish i could just poof out of existence without bothering anybody. Ive already wasted so much."

"SL #5i'm exhausted, 

i'm tired, 

i'm 99% done with life,

i'm done trying, 

its my life,

i'm the author, 

i choose when to end it and how to end it.

i'm tired of living for my family or friends. 

i keep telling myself that it will get better in time, i keep telling myself that this is just part of life or that i will soon be happy. but i'm not happy and i never will be. I can try and get help but it wont do anything, it wont work. why is the world so judgmental. why cant we live our own lives without fear of shame and embarrassment. why do we shove our beliefs down each other throats. if you don't agree then you don't. at the end of the day were all humans. regardless of wither or not you believe that God is real or Zeus is real. It doesn't matter because on this earth, all we have is each other. why cant we learn to love. i'm not telling you to accept or conform to others but just remain respectful. when were kids, we don't see race, or gender, or sexuality or politics. all we see is each other and how we love to play tag together. so why is that when we get older, negativity just takes over. you wont realize how much you needed me till i'm gone. i'm not saying that to sound stuck up. i'm saying that because i loved you all. i saw past your flaws and past your negative energy. but you didn't do the same. you pointed out my flaws. you made them seem like it was the end of the world. you told me that i was worthless. you told me that if i didn't change, know one would love me. you made fun of my mental health. you knew. you saw the signs. you read my hints. but you chose to focus on yourself and ignore me. you played the victim while I tried to help you. maybe that was my fault. i loved and loved everyone but i could never learn to love myself. I thought i could be the one to make a difference in the world. silly me. i only soon realized that they were called fairy tales because they never come true. wishes don't come true. your born into this world for a specific reason, to carry out a certain task. sometimes that task is to be an example. i'm an example. i'm an example of someone who loved too much but could never learn to love himself. I was happy once upon a time. but the weight of the world was too much for me to carry. after all, i had already been carrying everyone's problems on top of mine.  maybe i should have been more vocal about my problems. maybe i should have reached out. but as family and or friends, are you telling me you never noticed? you never saw my texts? you never listened to my music? did you never see my sleepless eyes? my slit wrists? my tears on my pillow? are you saying that you never knew? that's a lie. you knew, you just chose to not to do anything. why? were you afraid. were you scared that you would have done more harm? you wouldn't have, have you just told me that you love me. that would have made me look at life in a whole new set of eyes, had you told me that you see my struggles. that i'm going to be okay, that you'll always be there for me. i wanna cry, i want to just hold on to something, i'm tired, this sadness is like a bug who wont leave you alone on a hot sunny day, i want to get better, i really do. but i cant. you wont let me, i wont let myself, I've written so many suicide notes and each day i tell myself that today will be my last day. its not. i cant. i cant seem to bring myself to end it."
"Made an essay sorta based off FilthyFrank for English I suck at writing, but here it is https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-aVRq_SlFVVysERgIh4gq_5wu0Ek2C_38EtxEz5Cwlk/edit"
Suicide is the right decision for my life.I thought about for awhile and i figure the damage from my death would be felt hard but over time people get over it. Outside of that nothing else is holding me back besides saving up for a gun and finding that window of courage.
"Is today the day?Iâm debating on ending it.  I donât fit in to this world.  I look around and Iâm not a carefree partier like all the other college age kids.  I suck at being my age.  Iâll never have anyone special.  I look at all these spoiled housewives whoâs husbands do any and everything for them (work, pay for them to be pampered and go on exotic vacations, cook for them, clean, etc) and I know Iâll never be valuable enough for someone to wrap the world up in a pretty package, set it at my feet, and cater to my every whim.  
I have a hard time relating to kids my age and that puts a serious damper on the whole âmake friendsâ and âdateâ thing.  The friends I DO have treat me badly and only talk to me or respond to me when itâs convenient or when they need something.  I have no reason to believe a spouse wouldnât treat me that same way since it seems obvious that Iâm not worth being good to even though I have ALWAYS tried to be a good friend to others.  Meanwhile I watch people who were mean to me when I was a child and they are doing so well in life.  I just feel like I am abnormal, thereâs things wrong with me, I donât matter, I donât belong, I will never be happy, and the ONLY thing I want anymore is to leave this world and let everyone else go on partying.
I hate my job.  My family isnât there for me.  When I try to tell my mom I just get all this rot about how I can choose to be happy and if Iâve made a dumb decision (seems like every decision I make is bad) it just goes back to an âI told you so!  You didnât listen!â 
I want to die.  Thereâs no room for me in this world.  I pray that God will just spare me the trouble and end me.  But he hasnât.  Maybe I should just go do it myself?"
"Iâm just going to do it..I donât see a point anymore, I give up. Nobody cares about me anyways I just quit. Iâm done, I give up on everything. Iâm just going to end my suffering..."
"This might be the last thing anyone ever sees from me.Where to begin, I'm some 20 something Hispanic guy that lives in the New York New Jersey area. 

I grew up rather poor. 

I grew up somewhat alone. I mean I had friends but I never had much of a family to speak of. My mom is a very cold and damaged woman. She was a bit warmer at one point but only when it was easy. My dad was even worse off emotionally speaking, due to scars from his childhood.
Emotionally speaking I've mostly been alone I've never been very good about broaching these topics.

I'm a failure. 

This would be easier to stomach if I could say I were stupid. But I can't because I got accepted and went to some smart highschool(less than 10 from my student body got in). I got an 1800 back when max was 2400 on the SAT having never studied for it or for much of anything. Mine is a story of disappointing people, my teachers, myself. Academically all I've ever done was coast by. In the sense that I've always done the minimum.

Maybe I could make the excuse I were poor. That one is somewhat flimsy in some ways. Sure it is true I grew poor. But that highschool was a real opportunity. I essentially get paid to go community college. 

I have a therapist who tried their best. Can any therapist really replace the people who should've been there as I grew. The people who are supposed to guide and nurture. If you heard some of the stuff they told me as I grew HAH.

My point is I harbor a deep resentment for what my existence was compared to what I feel it could've been. Maybe I'm just weak I've seen some do more with comparatively similar financial and possibly familial situations. 

My mantra after all this is ""no one cares"". If you had a chance to save someone what would you do? What would you give?  The answer to me is nothing. Everyone has their own lives, their own problems. 
How can anyone afford to care in this world? Why would they stick their neck out like that? Most would rightly call them foolish. 

My current existence is that of a leech and I can't bear it any longer. I had a job once worked at it for nearly a year but I didn't like trying to trick people to get stuff they didn't need.

I actually intended to end it yesterday but turns out the place I needed closes at night. So I went to some hotel to think for a bit and try again tomorrow.

Anyway I don't know what I hope to gain from this post. Maybe an opportunity, maybe some words as empty as they are, maybe a hand. I guess I just tire of the struggle. What am I fighting for? Myself?

My phone is getting somewhat low and I have no charger since this was kind of spur of the moment. So I'll check on this in some hours.

"Still Thinking About ItSo a couple years ago I was fired from my job... That was the culmination of years of being miserable and abusing alcohol.  I was drunk a lot of the time (yes at work) because I was not happy.  I hated my job and where I was in life.  It was the proverbial vicious cycle. 

After I was fired I spiraled into a deep depression.  I thought about killing myself all the time.  Every single day.  What I told my therapist ""I don't really want to kill myself.  I just don't want to be anymore.""  I was lay in bed before my alarm went off praying (to no one in particular) not to wake up. 

After getting another job that I loathed my depression only deepened.  At the urging from my mother and sister I agreed to begin taking anti depressants.  I was also quitting the booze at the same time.  Apparently this was a bad combo because my suicidal ideation kicked into overdrive.  I was not only thinking about suicide.... I was actively planning mine.  I had a plan to wrap up some stuff and consolidate some financial stuff and then do it.  Thankfully my sister sensed what was going on and got me help.

I had a psyche eval, which does nothing to make you feel any less crazy, by the way.  Anyway, some tweaks to my meds and more intense therapy helped me.  In the time since I have gotten an amazing job which I love.  I have fallen in love with a woman who will soon become my wife.  My relationship with my family is as good as it's ever been...

So why do I still think about suicide every day????"

"Nightmares do come true.Everytime I think about dying, the feeling has been stronger.  This time, I honestly don't know what the point of living is at all.  I've tried so hard to change everything, and I've changed so much about myself.  Yet here I am, lonely, extremely isolated while trying so hard not to be(I talk to people, I go out, I socialize, I work out, I take care of myself, I do so much to improve.... ), It has been fruitless.. and one of my worst nightmares has come true regardless.  I've been neglected by everyone in my life.  They never tell me why.  They're too FUCKING NICE to tell a fucking piece of shit how he is a piece of shit.  At least tell me something so I have something to improve upon.  Don't just fucking leave me and act like I never FUCKING EXIST!!!! I want to love myself, I do.  I tell myself that I deserve better.  But moments like this I can't help but resent myself, feel sad and pity my shitty existence.  I am in constant stress, anxiety, and depression.  I don't show it to people because it's not cool to do that.  They tell me I'm nice and so calm and cool.  Maybe I can show them how cool I am with a fucking bullet in my fucking brain.  "
"17F - i donât think i can go on any longeri feel so alone, i recently got more help for myself and started working towards being better and taking better care of myself and everything has fallen apart. the person i love broke up with me today, i have no friends and no relationship with my family. i just feel so alone and so tired, i donât want to be alive any longer."
Sometimes I wish no one cared about me so that I could kill myself with no regret ..Because others caring about me is the only thing keeping me alive.  Iâm so emotional and I constantly remind myself how pathetic I am.
"Itâs just not worth it anymoreSince I was 8 or likely before, I canât really remember much on my childhood, Iâve wanted to kill myself. I just canât shake the feeling that life isnât worth it, the effort is just... wasted, worthless; itâs an investment made for you without your consent that generates pitiful returns everyone expects you to be hyped about. 

Well, Iâm not, my job takes the things I love about what I do and crams them full of so much kafkaesque bullshit itâs nearly unrecognizable. I have ADHD and struggle to do something if Iâm not personally interested and while I have my meds they donât last all day. Hell, even when they are working it feels tainted with the knowledge that they could be taken away at any moment, and I would without question pop enough opioids to kill a horse six times over if that happened. 

Last time I took an IQ test was in middle school, back before I took meds and would be so miserable in class Iâd end up running around for no reason so who knows how shit the results were but I got 135-140. Got put in gifted classes and couldnât do the simplest of logic charts, because I didnât care. Was basically seen as the class moron; whatâs the point of being intelligent if itâs all fucking useless? Its as if Iâm being taunted by biology itself; I can teach myself anything I care about but the second I actually fucking need to do something Iâm a pencil tapping, leg bouncing, chair spinning, thousand yard stare stuck in my own head sack of shit. Just salt in the fucking wound knowing you should be able to be a âsuccessââwhatever the fuck that meansâbut your idiotic lazy fucking ass would rather study shit thatâs entirely irrelevant while the work you have to do stacks up and up and up. Iâve lived my life by the skin of my teeth and canât even feel last minute panic anymore; the fuck kinda adult even says that shit? 

I donât want to do this anymore; Iâm fucking tired."

I canât escape from my own head, any attempt to get out and make it better leads to worse anxiety.

"I send a message to my crush and told her i loved her Sorry for bad english, it's not my first language.

I'm a straight 15 years old boy, and i have a crush on a 16 yo girl for almost a year. I love everything about her, and I finally got the courage to tell her I love her. Obviously, she said she didn't liked me that way, but that we could still be good friends, but I don't know how to talk to her the next time i see her. What should I do?"
"Cold Raindrops in a Colder Ocean episode 1Thereâs this human in this ugly reality. His ugly reality. 
And he wants to go. Just go. Go go go! 
He is prepared and ready to go. Where? Somewhere not here. 
More specifically he is ready to die.. He wants to leave in that sense
He doesnât want to be anymore.
And even if he leaves, he arrives somewhere else where he doesnât want to be
Wherever he goes, itâs still an ugly reality. One he canât seem to escape.
The only escape is in the mind.
Choosing a different destination - will give him a sense of direction.
Getting ready to leave and being on the go... Gives him peace.
Getting lost in his work - gives him some relief
And getting lost in distractions.. Gives him some time to think. 
Like in that âwaiting for the downloadâ meme.
Itâs existential dread. One existential crisis then another.
Reasons to give up outweighing the reason to try again.
Reasons to exists being overwhelmed by the reasons to end it.
He is ready to go. Thatâs all he knows.
He feels like going.
He does not want to stay. Only go.
Thereâs this human in an ugly reality. And he is prepared to go."

"I need some help pleaseI am miserable, and i want to die. Ive been molested all my life up until the age of 12 by 4 different people, two of those people being my uncle and my sister. Im 16 turning 17. I despise my parents. I have two jobs (tutoring), but after june 23 i am going to work elsewhere, and i currently maintain a 93 gpa. That however is not enough for my parents. My sister and I would fight all the time. Her being 6 years older then me. When i was twelve she broke 4 of my teeth when she was punching me, causing infection and cavities because my parents didnt take me to a dentist until two weeks after. I have 5 root canals done thanks to obamacare, but my teeth hurt so much everyday, sometimes the pain is unbearable even with motrin or tylenol. After my moms dad died back in 2010, it has all gone to shit. She is batshit crazy, emotionally manipulative, and extremely selfish. She has always been but hid it well. I told her once when I was 8 years old about what my sister did to me, i drew a picture and wrote as best as i could because i was too embarrassed to say anything, she just laughed at me. That really fucked me up. I was confused as to why she didnt want to help. I wanted to kill myself when i was 8. My mom is extremely religious and thought i was the devil. I hated church. I was an accidental baby and i know for a fact i am not loved. My parents are middle class and they have a good amount of money, but only spend it on themselves and my sisters college. I felt so ugly wearing my sisters hand me downs, i just want nice things and although im not materialistic i just dont want to look like shit. I got a scholarship to my school and everyone there is rich. I dont fit in. Ive done disgusting things for money but thats the only way i can buy my own clothes, necessities, and books for school. I make about 80 dollars a week tutoring which mostly goes to drugs. My parents dont let me leave the house and they complain that all i do is sleep.i go out once a month and dont come home until 6am. My parents resent me for this and make me feel like shit and then my mom bitches about how much money she put in raising me and she just wants me to have a good life. Fuck that selfish bitch. I thank God school is over so i dont have to be locked in my bathroom sized room studying 3 hours a day. I recently found out my father masturbates to me and i just feel so weird. My dad is never home. All my boyfriends have have been controlling. I felt so heartbroken when my alcoholic ex boyfriend (the only person ive ever loved romantically) got a bitch pregnant. Fucking alcoholics. Anyways, i have nothing left to live for except drugs and although the cutting is soothing its not enough to end the pain. I am thinking of killing myself after my sister leaves for summer break because although she has done that to me, we grew up and she is like mother to me now. Isnt that twisted? I like to beliece that in my past life i was a huge bitch or something because i dont understand why so much bad happens. Why cant my parents just let me live. What is the point if im miserable. I myself am far from perfect. I feel terrible for using my boyfriends to get what i want. I have no one to talk to for my best friend got sent away to military camp. Sorry for the horrible grammar and formatting, i am using my sisters shitty phone. Thanks for taking your time to read, i never opened up to anyone before."
"I donât really know what to doI donât even know why Iâm here. I guess a part of me wants to live. Perhaps itâs me searching for pity; I donât know. Everyone thinks Iâm fine, as I suffer in the dark. So fucking edgy, but I canât change it. I want to kill myself later today. I donât even know what to do"
"I want outThis is my second post to this subreddit now; my first one was a few days ago.

To recap, I was recently diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and put on Zoloft. The medicine feels like its working, for the most part, but later in the day I feel worse than before to the point that all I want is to die.

At the time of my last post, all of my friends save one had given up and stopped talking to me. The only one that stayed helped me get treatment and knew exactly what to do to make me feel a million times better. Now, she's given up on me too. For the first time that I can remember, I'm all alone.

I feel like all I do is screw things up. I was almost fired today because I fucked up so badly, but the only thing that saved me was that I used to keep trying new things and trying to make things better. Recently, I just dont feel motivated the same way as I used to and if I screw up one more time, I'm out the door. 

Today was the first time that I thought about how I could kill myself. At this point, I want nothing more than to die."
"I need to dieI donât know how else to put it. Honestly Iâm not going to kill myself because I donât think I can, but I want to be dead so bad. Iâve wanted to be dead for so long itâs overwhelming. Thereâs nothing you can do about it. I beg god to kill me most nights and I really mean it. Itâs so hard to be alive. I have no reason to live. No one ever chooses me. Im a leftover. Iâm just a rounding error.  I donât belong anymore. I donât have a career and donât think I ever will. I fail at everything.  And I donât care. Iâd be fine with it. If it could just end. If I could just not have to sit here all awake, because I canât sleep (because nothing is easy for me) i canât do anything. I just suffer silently, alone, for 33 years. And it never ends. Every phase. Every new path. Everything I try ends the same. Alone. Left out. So close to what I want I can taste it but not allowed to have it. I *hate* life. Iâve hated being alive since I was in third grade. And it just wonât end. Friends get sick and die miserable painful deaths of cancer in front of me who want to live so badly. But not me. Iâm still just here. Begging for death. Itâs not the drama of some kid saying oh god I hate my life. I *hate hate haaate* being alive. It enrages me. I donât know what else to do. Therapy doesnât help. Pills barely help.  What do I do?  How can I just die?"
"There is no âhelpâ. There is no hopeGets bad enough, friends leave.  Girl leaves.  Work soft fires me and calls me names.  Ends my career.  

Even therapist says Iâm fatalistic.  

There world made me like this - there isnât anything I can do.  My therapist canât give me the nurturing family I never had.  The psychiatrist isnât going to give me drugs that will make me forget how sick the world is.   Calling a hotline wonât get the girl who ghosted me to come back.

Iâm 31 years old.  A third through my life at best, and it only ever gets worse.  What am I supposed to do?  There is nothing left to try.  All there is is pain.  Of course no one wants to hang out with me, as my therapist says theyâd have to weigh the pros and cons of dealing with someone as depressed as I am.  

Everyone is a fake friend.  Iâm done.  Why wait."
"tired of paini have chronic pain, plus anxiety/depression/PTSD. some days getting out of bed is a struggle because it hurts too much to do basic tasks. i feel like a burden to my partner and family. im trying to ""tough it out"" but i am struggling to feel like it is even worth it. the pain is so bad i just keep thinking about dying. im young but the fact i have so many health issues making me unable to work/get on my feet has worn down on my self-confidence, it doesnt feel like i'll get better. the fact my death would effect others around me is enough to stop me from going through with killing myself, but i cant stop the thoughts, guilt, and urges to cut myself to distract me from my usual pain. i wish i could die alone somewhere without anyone noticing/caring. i just want the pain to stop."
"Finally think I'm ready to just do itI feel like tomorrow is the day that I finally want to end it all. I'm tired of feeling unloved, stupid, useless, worthless. I think it's best for everyone that I end it. Nobody loves me or gives a crap about me therefore I feel as if I have no purpose in being here. I've thought about it on and off for the last 5 years and now I think I'm finally ready. I'm afraid but once it's over it's over and there's no more emotional pain. "
My mind is constantly thinking about not wanting to be here anymoreIâm struggling so much. I feel so alone and I have no one to turn to. Not even a therapist. I think deep down I know I would never kill myself but that always just makes me hate myself even more
"comment your plan for your 20s mine is to learn academical subjects, learn how to cook well, learn how to bake, hit the gym, improve my appearance, grow intellectually and culturally as a person, obtain a healthy mindset and then let myself drown in sadness do drugs and die on impact after throwing my self off a cliff. Very quirky so what about yours?"
"A tip for those who dont like dropping a load with someone else around So, you walk in a public washroom and it is completely empty. So a minute goes by and you're doing your business when someone walks in and now you cant shit because its gonna make a loud splash. What i do is i put a thin layer of toilet paper on the surface (maybe 2 thin layers) to absorb the shock from the turd. If done properly you can do what you need to do without making a sound. Im sure people already knew this but this is for those who didn't. You're welcome."
"Why am I like this If I'm in a call with friends and their other friends whom I barely talk to enter the call as well, I have the ability to keep silent until the other friends leave the call because I feel shy and awkward around them"
"Is it ok for me to use future relaxation as a push?Iâm on winter break after a college semester and Iâm not really doing anything. Iâm acting very depressed (almost always thinking about negative things) so I thought of using things thatâll happen very soon that look forward to as a reason for me to be a little productive. These things include catching up on a tv series, having psilocybin and mdma sessions (I am practicing harm reduction and it helps immensely, I donât need any advice thx), and other small things to make myself comfortable. I figure sitting around and being happy (just in the moment) is better than sitting around and being crippled by suicidal thoughts without the energy to do anything about it. Iâm asking if itâs ok because I feel guilty that Iâm not being super productive.

This of course applies outside of my little example at this current time."

"I've been struggling with my mental health I (15 F) have been struggling with depression and overall poor mental health for the past few weeks. I've been withdrawn from my friends and family, and I've lost all motivation to do anything. I used to hang out or at least talk with my friends once every two days or so, but I haven't seen them in about a week and a half. My friends and I are incredibly close, so this has been really hard for me. School has really been kicking me while I'm down, too. I have overdue assignments, and I can't seem to think at all. My head feels like it's filled with cement and my chest feels heavy all the time. I constantly feel like I'm on the verge of tears, but I can't cry. I feel like I can't continue, I can't do it anymore. I used to be able to power through it in a day or so, but I've got nothing left anymore. Any advice or kind words would be much appreciated :)"

"About six months to go for this impoverished senior woman.I figure I have about six months to go before I die.  At that point I will have gone through my small saving from before my husband (age 77) divorced me (age 72) after 50 years of marriage with which I supplement my SS and half my husband's pension.  I can't make it on that.  My total income is $1100.00 total per month.  Rent is $740.  I have a car and insurance to pay for, can't walk well, and am rather rapidly losing the use of my hands.  Oh yes, my medical insurance runs out about then too.  I'm moderately suicidal every night.  During the day, I try to keep busy and  try to help the depressed and suicidal young people on Reddit.  I have no living family and few friends.  I am actually eager to end my life, but I have to wait until I can get enough belongings sold to go to Europe to end my life there with legal dignified suicide.  I would like to hear from other senior citizens who are in the same boat."
Anyone Wanna Chat? I am really getting bored.
"My FWB is talking about suicide, I don't know what to doI met this girl, and we kinda hooked up, and not a while ago I discovered that she has a history of depression and that she attempted suicide twice.

She is prone to low self-esteem, and with her parent's splitting up and extra stress, she's talking about suicide. I'm chatting with her, and she said a few hours ago that she's planning it for tonight and asked me not to interfere.

I'm suffering from crippling anxiety, and I'm freaking out. I'm trying to talk her out of it, and for most part I think that the worst has passed. But still, I don't know what to do.

Maybe she's thinking out loud, at least I'm hoping so, we had a same talk a few months ago and me managed to overcome it. I just don't know what to do, should I tell my parents, call the authorities, call her family (don't have their number, just social network profiles, don't even know them)?

I just don't know what to do in case she decides to harm herself, I'm just hoping that she's thinking out loud."

"Let's be real, most people stop giving a shit after a few weeks (if they ever even care at all)Suicide is a deeply personal thing. I've had two acquaintances kill themselves in the last two years. I hardly ever think about them. 

I don't want to kill myself. Im too scared to, and I dont want to be in pain. but some switch has flipped in my brain and my brain wants me to die. every day I have such strong suicidal thoughts. im running out of gas 

I wish my brain didnt want to kill me so much. I've been literally beating the shit out of myself lately. close fist punching myself in the face. Ive lost control. My forehead and knuckles are covered in visible bruises. I want to stop being in pain. I've saved up a lot of money for my funeral costs. for years I've been distancing myself from loved ones because i want to reduce the footprint of my suicide. It's inevitable I hurt my family. I wish i could make it look like an accident but that would only hurt them more i think. 

I still care about people and I want to LIVE. I'm trying SO HARD TO LIVE. I'm scared"

"Doctors stole my life with a botched iv. Now my body is a horror show and all I want, everyday, is to die a quick painless death.Had an MRI with contrast in 17. Radiologists conveniently forgot to tell me how toxic the iv was and some healthy patients (with normal kidneys) retain the toxin.

Oh and thereâs no way to get it out. And thereâs no research on the damage it can do.

A day later I lost feeling in much of my toes and fingers, blurred vision, insane fatigue, brain fog, joint pain throughout, vibrations all over that kept me up.

âOh geez,â the radiologists told me. âThatâs so weird! I dunno what to tell you; maybe see your primary care doc!â.

Gee thanks.

Here we are 3 years later and Iâm no better, and all I do each day is search suicide websites for the quickest easiest most painless way to kill myself.

Age
5-12 Physical, verbal bullying and social isolation
13-15 Social isolation. Something started in my head.
16-18 Domestic abuse and an enabler who kept telling me my abuser loves me. Social isolation. Homophobia. Video gaming addiction took root.
18-now Went abroad struggling with language barriers. Gaming addiction currently screwing with me. Social isolation ceased entirely.


I'm not struggling in any way. Financially it can be better but I think I'm well off to some extent. But I'm so nervous. It's hard enough to go to a doctor. And I get sick rather often. Health wise, it's much better nowadays though. I used to get sick nearly all the time, and it's all pretty major stuff.

I'm nervous. I want to sleep. Class is tomorrow. But negative thoughts are swirling in. I don't want to sleep. I don't want to face tomorrow. 

...I still don't get why my SO insists he loves me. My self esteem plummeted and doubt has taken root. ... Though I need to remind myself, I feel much better when I'm not playing games nonstop, either.

Should i get help??Last Wednesday instead of going to school i went to my sisters house and nobody was there cause she was somewhere visiting out of town. So I walked to her house and went through the window and just thought about killing myself. I grabbed a sheet and tied it into some sort of knot circle and put it on the bathroom door and closed the door. I grabbed a chair and i got up and put my neck around it. I was to scared to kick the chair down so i just kind of dropped my legs slowly off the chair. Two seconds later my head feels like its gonna pop off like explode so i got scared and got off of it and waited for awhile and then i went back and tried to do it again, i put it around my neck moved the chair alit bit and forced my hands to not grab the sheet instead i made my hands hang down while i hanged. It was like ten seconds and i jolted and kind moved and put my feet on the chair and got out real quick, i fell straight to the floor and layed down cause i felt like i just passed out like i saw black for a second and felt really dizzy i got up and like cried and i saw the time. it was almost lunch so i untied the sheet and went to my sisters room and slept. I wish i kicked the chair down because it felt easy to just die it felt like 10 seconds. I wish i can get help but i dont know how do i call the hospital and tell them im having deep suicidal thoughts and the whole week before and right now im still thinking about it.

my neck has kind of of a little bruise like a thin line of bruising and now my left side of my neck is like kinda swollen and sore like my lymph node is abit puffy"
"Afraid to leave the house because of my looks, I want to die.Hello. I should start off that I'm a 16 year old junior in high school. I've suffered from depression and anxiety since about halfway through the 7th grade (I currently take Cymbalta), and I've just recently been diagnosed as having Body Dysmorphic Disorder. I've been having very severe acne for over a year now, and it's the biggest cause of my self loathing. Apart from the acne, I absolutely hate my crooked nose, my height (5'6""), my penis size, my hair, my eyes/eyebrows, my smile is fucking ugly (I avoid smiling whenever possible). I might just sound like a self-absorbed teenager, but it's gotten to the point where I'm afraid to even leave the house because of how I look. I have to force myself to go to school every day, where my ""best friend"" constantly berates me for my bad acne. I can't go out to dinner with my parents and my brother because I'm afraid of stares from strangers. I've been blowing off hanging out with my friends because I just don't want anybody to see me, even those who I'm close to.

 I've been feeling suicidal about this for some time now, around 6 months. I just don't know what to do anymore. The medicine I'm taking (Cymbalta) doesn't seem to help anymore, and I can't seem to find any confidence within me. I want to die. I would honestly rather be dead than have to deal with my hideous looks and disapproval from others."

"I just cannot catch a break.I have $50 in my checking account. On March 14th, I will be treating myself to my last meal.

I am really good at what I do. I'm great with people. I'm great at talking and listening to people. Four years ago, today. A woman told me that I had a gift, imploring me to share it to the world. Since then, I've spent every day perfecting my craft. Participating in podcasts and live-streams with the dream of being a radio host akin to Howard Stern.

But I can never catch a break.

I've supported myself with dead-end shifty jobs for my entire adult life. I worked at a company that demoted an entire management tier. Moved to another company to be trained as a manger, only to be strung along for six months. While my mother was pressuring me to move out under a minimum wage salary.

The only way I could, was to move across the country with my brother. Couldn't find work their, had my car repo'd. We were kicked out of our apartment. And I took a big gamble moving out of state again to work with my friend on his company.

Every day, I'm reminded that I'm a guest in this house. Despite us both running this business as partners, full time. This company is going under, because of his arrogance. I've brought up the problems, and he refuses to listen.

Through some really dark times with no power. This isn't the first time I've written a letter like this one. But I've always put it to the side because there was at least a little hope.

That hope is fading. This is gonna sound hella nerdy, but fuck it. In the past, I've had movies and games to look forward to. The new FFXIV expansion looks like it isn't going to fix any problems it has. Crash Remastered doesn't have the same charm. We all know Star Wars 8 is just gonna be another Empire. Etc.

Tomorrow, I'm expressing my concerns with my business partner, again. He'll probably agree, but then forget like he always does. I'm looking for one of those real jobs and giving it one final swing. I'm done being a burden to those around me.

The deadline, is March 14th. And I think I'll get a fried Mac&amp;Cheese burger from The Cheesecake Factory, with a slice of Key Lime Cheesecake to finish it off."

"19 and increasingly thinking about committing suicide.Hello everyone,

I'm a young man, I started engaging in self-destructive behavior and hating myself at the age of 7. My parents noticed this, I went to see a shrink, and it went better. I had a few moments in my life where nothing seemed to go the right way after that, but I kind of always got over it. 

However, I started a depression back in the winter, mostly because of my studies. I've always been very demanding towards myself, and my teachers have become increasingly demanding too, which led me to this depression when my grades started to disappoint both me and my teachers. I thought I was cured, I was wrong. A week ago, the depression came back, and it was even stronger than before. 

I hate myself for not working enough, for not being good enough, for disappointing myself and others, for being mean to others when I'm nervous and tired. I sometimes get mad at myself, I yell at myself, and I even hit myself when I lose my nerves. When I think about suicide, I think about my relatives and I am even more convinced I'm a horrible person. I'm pretty privileged, I have loving parents and siblings, and friends I can trust, and though I say I'm disappointed with my results at exams, I don't do that bad, which makes me think I'm an even more horrible person because I can't be happy with that. My studies aren't a valid reason for being depressed. War in my country would be a valid reason. The death of a close relative would be a valid reason. A terminal illness (I've been wishing I had one lately) would be a valid reason. Sometimes I think there must be another way to explain the way I currently feel.

Talking of relatives, none of them has a clue of how depressed I am. I live alone in a small flat, so I don't see my family every day. I talk with my friends and classmates a lot, and we have a lot of fun together. When I'm alone, my negative feelings come back and I start thinking about suicide again.

I can imagine how shocked they would be when I die of suicide. The thing is there will be only one attempt. I've figured a pretty efficient method to do it, and I hope it will leave a doubt I didn't want to kill myself in the first place. I don't want my relatives to know I kept on hating myself. I don't want them to be sad because they couldn't keep me in this world. I swear to you, they've done pretty well at the moment. I don't want to talk about my depression with them, mainly because it's terribly humiliating to me, and because I fear not being able to suicide if I talk about those suicidal thoughts.

Sorry for my possible grammar mistakes and my writing style, and thank you in advance for listening."

"High School student worried about disappointing my parentsI know this seems really petty but I really don't know what to do. I'm in the IB program at my high school. It's July 5th and my parents will get my report card tomorrow. Now this is really hard because I had promised my parents I would do better after the first semester, where my marks were really disappointing. I know it's my fault for not putting in the effort but I think I also have ADHD, I can barely focus in school or at home, I really don't want to tell my parents that. I really don't know if I want to live through this disappointment, and I honestly feel bad for my parents. They pretty much assumed I was able to go to university (I got into IB afterall) and now that's in jeopardy. My Father told me that if I'm not as successful as him (he makes like 100k a year) I'm a disappointment to him. It's also worsened because my parents had just planned a vacation starting July 7th to congratulate me on finishing my first year of high school.

I fucking dug myself into a hole now by doing nothing but play video games for the past week since I figured that's the last enjoyment I'm going to get.

How do you guys cope with not being able to meet expectations?

"A message to all reddit DO NOT and I mean DO NOT post art.

Reddit is like that.  If it ain't hentai, its downvoted.  I aint a good artist, and I dont draw often, but when I get a thing done I like to get praise for it.  Maybe it's in my cubistic and rough art style, but maybe it's because yall are pieces of shit.

Only a masochist willingly posts art to Reddit.  I had a friend once get bullied off the platform for a minor flaw, and they said they shouldn't expect praise for pouring their soul into something.  That's what I've learned here.  Agree with the hivemind, make memes, and you will be awarded.  Deviancy is awarded in bullying.

I fucking hate it here.  Fuck you all."
I want to die I want to die I want to die I want to die I want to dieim so GROSS. im FAT and UGLY and I will never have a nice body or a pretty face. even when I lost almost 30 lbs and was down to 107 I did not hav a nice body-i was just skinnier. Now that I gained it all back its even harder for me to loose the weight again and I hate my body. my boobs are to small and I just have an overall bad body. im sooo ugly and I can usually ignore this until I leave my house and I see one girl after another with a face 100x prettier than me and ITS JUST NOT FAIR. I truly want to kill myself . im not good at anythingggggg. not one thing. im a loser. I fuck up everything good in my life. tonight I went to a party and I couldn't even enjoy myself bc I was sober and sooo self conscious. I have the biggest urge to just slit my wrists rn.
"I thought Iâd be better by now.Iâve been depressed and emotional erratic since I was about 12. I always used to say to myself that when I was older, it would all be gone and Iâd be better, and thatâs what pushed me through. Iâm now 18, and just a couple weeks ago tried to hang myself. 

I used to channel my sadness into academia and writing, now I can barely do that as Iâve lost the creativity and motivation. 

I donât know how much more medication, therapy, hospital visits and waiting I can take. I feel like suicide is the only option at this point- I always go back to the thought. "

"HelpPlease I just need someone to talk to... I dont know what to do anymore. 

My parents dont think I'll make it when I leave the house they think I'm a failure that cant support itself. They're desperate, they dont know what to do. How do I tell them that that's not true, when I know that once I live on my own I'll killmysef? How can I lie like that in their faces? 

I've been planning to kill myself when I leave home for 5 years. I just turned 17. I dont want to make them sad, or upset them. They keep telling me that all I do is just lay in bed, I dont help with the house work at all. How can I tell I'm just too focused on being alive, for THEM? You cant tell a parent that. 

I've told my doctor that the antidepressants dont work, he doesn't really seem to care. I mean I didn't even talk that much on the first appointment and he prescribed me antidepressants right away. How did he know I actually had depression? I could be faking it for drugs. I've told him that the antidepressants only make me worse multiple times. He told me that I have to give it some time, but I've given it a LOT of time. 

I asked my parents to change doctors, and after a while they said yes, but they havent made any move towards taking me to a new psychiatrist. I dont know why but I'm afraid to tell them again. I just want to end this but I keep trying, for them. And they dont even appreciate the effort I'm making. It's just too hard. I dont wanna do this anymore. I'll never be happy, I can't even remember what happiness feels like. Was I even happy?"
"I hate Egypt i hate this place I hate Egypt i hate everything about it and everyone in it i hate its streets i hate it's education system i hate the government i hate how they think i hate how they're living 

Every dream i had is destroyed by Egypt 

Every wish every fantasy they destroyed it 

All hope for things to get better is shattered 

All plans go in vain 

I hate everything about it and i can't even kill myself because i am religious 

Running away will never help either 

I have my Dutch passport 

Travelling to another country will not help i still belong to this trashass land and this community full of assholes 

I was born here. I am Egyptian. 

I will for my whole life think Egyptian and live Egyptian 

Even if i was on whatever land

This is who i am and i hate it i will never find love i will never be happy i will never do what i love i will never have good internet i will never enjoy video games i will never make a movie i will never be a teacher i will never have a pet i will never go to parties i will never do anything and i blame Egypt. Egypt's effects will stay on me forever like a trauma i also blame my family for not running away when they had already had the Dutch passport it wouldn't be better but i would have appreciated them trying

"Itâs easier to have someone kill you insteadI feel so empty and alone (26/F). I hate my job and my love life has been non-existent. Iâve been having a hard time finding a job in the entertainment/cosmetics/fashion or sports retail industry (Nike/Addidas, etc). I work in tech and I hate it so much (company is actually great but I have no interest in the products or services) but Iâm staying in because of the job security and thereâs so much uncertainty with business these days due to the coronavirus.

I worked hard for my career - Iâm self-taught in my profession and earned my employments from my own effort instead of handouts and being fed by a silver spoon. Itâs the only true accomplishment Iâm proud of. 

I still have feelings for this asshole that I dated on and off and Iâm still crying over him. Itâs embarrassing and pathetic and a clear sign of my lack of self-respect and confidence. Iâve been trying to date for years and nothing has really panned out romantically. Itâs so hard to find people to connect with these days.. Iâm tired of feeling depressed, anxious, and suicidal. It comes in waves. The suicidal national hotline is more helpful that the number of therapists Iâve met over the years. Itâs hard to find people who care about you. Itâs hard to find a mental health professional that will invest in you. 

I have always been this strong, independent, ambitious, and optimistic person but Iâm now indifferent and apathetic on most things. I donât care enough to do my best and live my best life anymore. That version of me died when my job burnt me out last holiday and my love life not panning out only made things worse. This past winter, I wanted to either drive my car off a cliff or collect a few bricks, tie them around my ankles, waist and wrists and jump into a lake or off a bridge and die by drowning.

When I was able to afford a monthly boxing membership in DC, I would always allow myself to get beaten to the pulp. I like the feeling of getting beaten. I like seeing the bruises on my body and drifting to unconsciousness. It reminds me of my childhood from when I was physically abused by my parents and kids from school. Itâs nostalgic and a familiar feeling I like clinging on to. Can anyone relate to this? 

I want to find someone who is willing to shoot me. I have a rope in my room to hang myself as a last resort but Iâd prefer someone to do it instead. Could I hire someone for this? Is legal assisted suicide a thing now? I think I read that somewhere. 

Random, but do any of you have a playlist for when youâre feeling depressed/suicidal? I feel like shit right now and I want to share some of my favorite songs from my sad playlist (in random order):

1. Call out my name - The Weekend
2. Creep (live) - Carrie Manolakos
3. All who remain - Beware of Darkness
4. Shadow of the day - Linkin Park
5. Waiting for the end - Linkin Park
6. Donât go home without me - Lights 
7. Lay it all on me - Ed Sheehan 
8. Best part - H.E.R., Daniel Caesar
9. Love, Dad - Harry Hudson
10. 1-800-273-8255 - Logic

(For the love songs on here: I like listening to sad love songs or pretend like I have someone to care for or miss romantically because it makes me feel a little less lonely.. fake it til you make it?). The Ed Sheehan song on my list goes out to all of my true friends out there. I will carry all of your emotional burdens with ease. I love you guys and I will be there for you until I finally kill myself or have someone do it for me.)"
"I write a suicide note every night but can't go through with itI'm just tired of living. I have no ambitions, passions, hope left at all. I've moved across continents for people but it is never enough. There must be something about me that is just inherently not likeable. Why must I live this unhappy and draining life? I just want to end it without my family getting affected or anyone else blaming themselves. I just want it all to end. Everyday I write a new note thinking I'll end it tonight, saying my good byes to people I love and people who don't love me back. But I can never go through it. It's my birthday in 4 days maybe that could be the day I do it on. I don't want anyone to blame themselves but I can't take it anymore. "
"By staying alive, I am an inherently bad person.I am a waste of this planet's limited resources and a burden to everyone who has to tolerate my existence. I am rude, an eyesore, and completely useless. I was kicked out of the 12th grade due to ""triggering"" other students, and I can't get a job because I cry during interviews.

I am worth nothing. I have no skills, no hobbies. I do nothing in my daily life. I am housebound. I don't know how to socialize, so I refrain from doing so at every given chance. I believe that I am at the age where I am too old to learn how to socialize. It seems to be a skill that one is required to understand by childhood. I sometimes believe that I am autistic, but no one takes me seriously, and I'm probably incorrect anyway. I don't fit enough of the symptoms. I'm just stupid.

I will never find love. I greatly despise everyone who makes the claim that ""anyone can find love"". This is a lie. I am going to die alone. I am an objectively hideous person, and I'm horribly afraid of other people. I know for a fact that I will never be able to fully trust another person. That's been robbed from me. I wish I was able to repress my sexuality. I try to convince myself that I am asexual, but I know way too well that that isn't true.

It seems as though relationships have a ""deadline"". That there's a certain age where one is expect to have had at least one partner by. By the way people describe it, I've passed that age.

My death would mean nothing. Don't dare say otherwise. You don't know me, and if I were to die today, you wouldn't know. It would have no affect on you. You know nothing of me. Not what I look like, where I live. I can only promise that whatever you're imagining, I look much worse."
"[25/F] Struggling and ScaredHi. I'm not entirely sure how to put everything into words.. I just, don't have anyone. My partner of 3 years left me, 10 days ago. Just ""didn't want to do it anymore."" He was my entire future, we had planned half a wedding, chosen kids names etc. He told me he loved when I went to work that day and then as I stepped foot in the house that night he said he couldn't do it anymore. We have to live together for another 10 months (separate rooms at least) 

I'm just really struggling because I don't see a point in anything anymore. The pain I feel so strongly and physically, it makes me sick. I can't eat properly, I can't sleep properly. I have a promotion at work and it is meaningless to me now. I have time off soon as well and what do I do with all that time now? I tried to talk to him about how I was feeling and struggling (he's doing really well, he's happy now) but he just gets mad at me. I write pro and cons lists every single day of why I should end it and the pros always win. Today would be the perfect day. He's out, he's drunk with all his friends. Our other housemate is with him. No one can get to me. No one would be home for days. The pain scares me... but it scares me more to keep going."

I live in Gso, NC. I have no family, I canât afford to move. I have no car. I have no drivers license.

I had a decent job a few years ago but left because I was getting bullied (black guy in a majority Hispanic factory)

I graduated from university with a 3.5 but I canât get a job remotely in my field.

Since then Iâve been homeless, I have a place now but all my little money goes to bills. Iâm in several programs that say theyâll help but Iâve been unable to find a better job.

I really want to just kill myself. I canât handle feeling isolated. I canât handle failing at everything in life. I JUST DONT HAVE A SOCIAL NETWORK TO GET MY FOOT IN THE DOOR.

Iâve survived 3+ suicide attempts AND Iâm always back in this position. I DONT WANT TO HEAR ANY BULLSHIT JOB ADVICE. 

I DONT HAVE ANYONE THAT WILL MISS ME OR BE IMPACTED BY MY SUICIDE. I spent my childhood poor. I thought education would change my life - but it only made me more self conscious.

Hopefully Iâll be dead soon. I definitely have a plan."
"Not sure what's happeningI'm just a fairly average teenager (16). I grew up seeking his attention and approval, which only earned me some contrived diatribe about how ""fucking stupid"" I am.  Today, I realize how hard he works and everything as the sole provider, but I cannot respect or forgive him for some of the things he has done to me.  My ""condition"" as I would like to call it started in middle school when (long story short) my best friend lied to me, backstabbed me for some girl he ended up cheating on anyways, and spread lies about me that effectively reduced the number of my friends to a modest 0. At that time I was also the ""councilor"" for an entire group of angsty teens that was going through middle school drama but worse, with some severe cutting and plenty of things to worry about for them.  I slipped into a hormone-induced ""depression"" where I would cry just about every day for a few months, and would often stand on my house's balcony with a noose around my neck while everyone was out. I never talked to anyone, and nobody ever talked to me.  I eventually improved to the point where I could function and laugh, but with a underlying sadness that I couldn't shake.  About a year and a half later in freshman year of high school after about 3 or 4 rejections from girls. Freshman year, I was feeling pretty good until the first dance of the year when my ""date"" ditched me for another guy and ended up making out with him while I sat alone. That year, I became so dysfunctional that I couldn't even go to school or play sports in periods of about 3 days at a time. I again stood over the same balcony with the same noose around my neck or a knife to my throat several times. I eventually improved to a functional point again, but with the same underlying sadness that I could never get rid of. This time the sadness didn't just linger, it grew. And my method of dealing with it was to dull my emotions, now to the point where I am awkward as fuck and with very dulled emotions (if they can be called ""emotions"" at this point).  Cut to this past week, I worked up the strength to ask a girl that I've know for forever and liked for a long time to the homecoming dance, which is a week after the SAT, which I have taken classes for 3 months for. In the end, I asked her whether or not to go as friends, which is all she wants to go as.  I hate all of my friends, am nervous as fuck for the SAT, and this seemed to be the last straw. My ""depression"" is back, and it just seems that I can get within a hairsbreadth of suicide over the mere thought of spilled milk, but I can feel almost even good at times also.  Something in my head constantly tells me I'm worthless and should just die.  Why can't I deal with stress?  I feel like I should just kill myself and save everyone else the hassle of dealing with me.

EDIT: I have talked to a few people about it since sophomore year, but it hasn't helped much."

I don't want to BE anymore...I don't want to deal with these stresses that I cry about like a Bitch every night that no one cares  about..I don't want to worry about anything I just want to be gone...I just want to have peace...

I have several plans and I'm not sure why I'm still here...last ditch effort I guess..."
"how to manifest ur dream life \- stop being rude to urself this includes self deprecating jokes 

\- visualise the HIGHEST VERSION OF URSELF and understand that if u can visualise it, its a potential reality &amp; u can make it come true

\- start showing up as ur highest self: what do they look like? how do they act, talk, and walk? what\s a habit they have? what time do they wake up in the morning? how do they treat people? answer these questions and apply them to urself

\- listen to music that makes u feel good, NO SAD MUSIC

\- take care of urself, stop going back to ppl who dont value u 

\- write down ur goals (or try scripting, where u write a journal entry as if u already have everything u want)

"Exhausted by my own negativity	For the past two years or so itâs been a struggle, or maybe itâs always been a struggle and Iâm just more aware of it.  I have bad days and worse; today was one of the worse.  All day today I was felt as if my head would explode from all the compulsive, negative thoughts swirling around in it; those fucking voices reminding me how stupid and useless I am.  I just wanted someone to ram a spear through my fucking chest.  Somehow I managed to get through the day yesterday without feeling suicidal, then I have a day like today and I get so mired in self-loathing that I canât even remember what it was like to feel at least kind of normal the day before.  I feel like soon enough Iâll get too tired of these dramatic lows that Iâll try in earnest to kill myself.
	Iâm a fairly compulsive person, and the things in life that bring me pleasure are fairly trivial and fleeting.  Luckily I have had the willpower to give up the more self-destructive things that I used to rely on for pleasure like weed, alcohol and porn, but now Iâm even beginning to become desensitized to my âhealthierâ alternatives like exercise, healthy food, music, movies etc. and just like those less healthy compulsions the high from each subsequent fix feels shorter and shorter.
	Iâve tried shifting the focus off of myself and trying to concentrate on working hard and volunteering for organizations I care deeply about, but these things leave me anxious and overly stressed about making my bossâs life easy and worrying about bigger things like environmental degradation and abuse against women.  I somehow make these things my personal responsibility and then get depressed over my inability to make everything work, which I know sounds absurd, but my nails get chewed down to nubs nevertheless.  Iâm able to deal with the fact that I have a dead-end job because of a useless arts degree and that I still live in my momâs basement at 25, but at this point the âlittle things in lifeâ that are supposed to make it all worthwhile arenât working anymore.  Itâs all just so fucking exhausting."
...Im 14 and i hate my life... i know this might seem like every other stupid 14 year old kid but ive been suicidal since 10 i would go into my kitchen late at night and reenact how it would be to slit my throught its rare that i dont have suicidal thoughts.

"Loneliness is the real killerThis may be long.

My name is Michael. I am from Ireland. I am 31 years old.

As a child, I spent most of my days between the age of 7 of 17 being physically and emotionally battered on an almost basis in schools because of my ugly appearance. I left before finishing school because I knew if I didn't I would probably end up killing myself.

I tried once, and failed.

I have always been able to make friends, but I have a hard time making *good* friends. There is nobody in my life right now that I could call a best friend. I am not close to my family. My mother has a tendency to do as much as he can to remind me how much of a failure I am, but I keep her in my life because I love her.

A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with body dysmorphia. This is a condition in which a person obsesses or worries over their appearance to the point of worry and / distress. It is crippling and has consumed my life. I look at my body and feel repulsed and disgusted by myself. Especially my face. I have a grotesquely huge forehead, like you see in one of those little green men.

I am also dealing with a crippling problem with my nervous system, that doctors can not find the cause of. My legs are in constant crippling pain. I can barely walk outside of my house, and to do so leaves me in tears with the wrong. The only medication that works leaves me as a zombie.

My disability has caused me to lose a lot of friends. Recently, one of them wouldn't invite me on an excursion because I would need my wheelchair to get around. 

About three years ago I fell in love with a very beautiful woman with two wonderful kids. Things with us were amazing, and the children treated me as if I was their own father. When things were hard, they were the rock that held me up. They kept me going when I felt I had nothing else.

About six months ago, one of them attempted to commit suicide while wt their grandmother. The grandmother is a vile, horrible woman that would verbally and emotionally abuse them. I got angry at my partner when I found out they were staying there. She blamed me for him trying to kill himself, and we haven't talked since.

I found out two days ago that she was sleeping with the father of one of the kids. I had been holding out for the chance that we could fix things, so I could be with the boys ago, but just knowing she was in the bed with this person...  makes me feel dirty, betrayed, sick. I will probably never see the boys again, and that absolutely breaks my fucking heart. 

I ran a website for 5 years, but I lost it yesterday because I got angry at someone for using racial and homophobic slurs in my company. It was a good outline to write and take my mind of everything.

The past five months have been nothing but unbearable physical pain and an insecurity that is stifling my inability to function. I've been going to doctors and talking to people but it just won't go away. My life has deteriorated to the point where I simply get up, watch things on the computer, then go to bed, and repeat every day. No friends, no support structure, no aspirations, no achievements... I would go out and do things, but nobody will join me or help me...

I'm tired. Absolutely exhausted and tired of pushing through everything. There is no purpose to my life. I am tired of being a burden on everyone with my depression and physical disabilities. I have no need to be here. I feel old. I'm just waiting out my days.

I *want* to end it, but I don't have the courage to go through with it. I have researched assisted suicide but its not available in this country.

I don't know what to do.

I apologise for the length of this."
i fucked up and i donât want to face the consequencesim not gonna make it. i just want it all to end but im not strong enough to go through with it. i donât have anymore reasons to stay.
"I hate being trans I just wish I was fucking normalLife is shit and just I feel lonely and isolated having no one understand how I feel. I can't come out to anyone because of my relatives and general fear of what people would do of they knew.
I was outed to my parents by my last school which was very religious and to sum it up I got pulled out and was told if I tried to come out again I'd get kicked out now I'm at a new school after doing online for a year and losing the majority of my friends. 
I think I just realised I don't have any actual friends at my new school its all fake and everyone percieves me as if I'm a woman. But its just so wrong and I don't know how much longer I can fake this bs for. No one really knows who I am and waiting feels impossible to me I just want it all to be over. I can't even look back on easier times because I never got to be me, when I was little I was constantly told I couldn't do 'boy things' and that I had to be a certain way and I ended up getting in trouble for acting out and trying to be myself. I never got to be me and any 'love' I recieved was conditional. I wasn't supposed to turn out like this.
Dysphoria is shit to say the least it makes me want to rip my body a part until its unrecognisable. My voice lets me down when I'm in public and I just hate it so much I can't stand it. 
Whenever someone says my deadname or refers to me as a woman I just want to punch them and tell them to fuck off. I hate haveting to live a life thats not mine and doesn't belong to me. I hate having no one who actually knows or cares for me. I hate being so fake all of the time.
Even after I die my relatives will put my dead name on my gravestone.
I think about hacking and cutting up my chest and genitals until theres nothing to recognise. I just want to be cis. If I was a cis man I wouldn't have to deal with this bs. 
I can't say everything would be better if I was a cis man but it would solve a lot of my problems."
This is just getting depressing... I haven't seen my freinds in so long that I have started showing memes to my couch...
Catching the busDoes anyone know where the catching the bus subreddit moved after it was banned by Reddit?
"I'm just tired of everything. Either I'm gonna kill myself, slice my thighs open or cry myself to sleep.Know what I'm a little bitch. I'm just here because I need someone to talk to. I'm literally just posting for attention. Because in all honesty who's going to give a fuck if I'm out of this place. I just want to cry yet tears won't come. I can't cry my pain away it doesn't work anymore. I'm fucking 16 and I'm ready to leave this world. Two attempts and I'm still here, still sitting here dead inside. I just want to feel the sharpness slide against my skin and watch the blood pool at my feet. I want to feel the lightness in my head as my heart races and my breath quickens. I want to feel the sting afterwards. 

This post was supposed to help me. Instead its just made my urge grow. "

"I'm not just saying this, but it's for you.Most people are just reactive, you're right. They don't think for themselves, for them it's monkey see, monkey do. But not you. That's the advantage you have, and it's not just an advantage, it's a pearl inside of you that will bring you what you used to want, what you used to feel, that you have been looking for. Only when your waters settle will you find what you seek. I'm not talking about the spew the penny-grabbing preacher speaks about when he says, ""You'll find what you truly desire, but it's not actually what you want...etc..."" You know, the same drab horse-meat they feed you. No, I mean, you will find what you know you want.

You think after all of the enormous pain you've had to tread through, the unbelievable agony, that it was all for nothing? Far from the truth. You will be restored ten-fold what was rightfully yours, and has been stolen from you. It's not going to be a bullshit dream that never moved you, but you're going to soon be able to be connected completely to nature and it will finally open up the best of the best life has to offer. There's no way after all of the abuse, the hatred, the lies, the betrayal, the near-death situations you've had to put up with, that it ends with a lackluster thing. Stop predicting things, they will come your way and come around. You have to keep carving your path, you're better and smarter than all of these dummies around you. Like I said, they only react, they act subconsciously, you on the other hand, have intentionality and a definite freedom of choice.

It's not going to be a disappointment, you will get what you are after. You know what it is, just do it, for you. You're the only one who has the answers. You're the only one who knows how to solve these difficult problems. Why turn back now? You're already here, the only way is forward to the best way.

It's been a Rolling Stones-world. You can't always get what you want, but you get what you need. To hell with that, you will get what you want, because you realized that there are actually no such things as needs in this world. There are only desires. Food, shelter, and water are desires, you only need them to live. You found out you don't even need those if you don't want to live anymore. So everything comes down to what moves you, and don't believe what moves you and what you think about all the time can't be achieved. It is coming your way, all the suffering wasn't some bitchslap end. I'm talking rough because I need to talk rough to someone who has had it rough.

Yes, they were assholes to you, yes no one understood the severity of your issues you had, all combined and prolonged over time. But forget about them, they didn't get it. And they were wrong. There's no sense in caring about people who only want to take you out. You know the rules, play by them now, and carve the path."
Why are people saying WAP is âsetting women back 100 years agoâ Like itâs just a song about some chicks talking about how they like sex and men. I donât see any problem or outrage when male artists sing about having sex or doing drugs

"I got help for myselfToday I have a psychologist appointment with one of the best psychologists in the state. I felt suicidal for two years and didn't tell anyone because I thought that if i did, things would only get worse. And they did for a while. Everyone I knew questioned who they were, asking themselves ""What kind of friend am I that I didn't notice one of my best friends is suicidal."" It took me weeks to convince them it wasn't their fault. But now we're here, and I'm getting help for myself. And I don't regret it one bit."

"Can't take much more nothing is really getting betterBeen struggling through depression, for what seems like forever now I'm 19 been fighting through it since I was 14. Now I am away from the abuse, I got the girl (But I am paranoid as fuck and she isn't even doing anything wrong, it's all just my head). I am terrified of failing out of college. My laptop fucking died and I essentially had to pay almost a months rent to buy one (need a decent one as I am in a computer related major). I'm really struggling at nights, I have absolutely no confidence and I have to fake it all the time, and after faking it for so long I find myself getting really angry at people and really anything which is something that has never happened before. I feel like i'm at my witsend and there isn't a light at the end of the tunnel. I really don't think living is worth it. I just want this pain my sickness to be over with, I don't think I can ever win, I never win at anything, nothing ever goes my way it always ends up in pain. What's the point, I can't take this living anymore, it just feels like I am already dying. "
"I'm lonely. Like, really lonely.What makes it hard is that I'm not alone at all. I have a bunch of friends and they're all really great. So I feel really awful about still feeling lonely. But I can't help it. It's impossible for me to have a connection with anyone or anything. Nothing feels real, you know how if you watch a movie and you go along with how the main character feels, and for that hour or so you kinda just don't exist? That's how I feel, except constantly. It feels like waking up with amnesia and being given all these memories and thoughts and feelings that aren't really yours. 

I don't even have anyone to talk to about it. No one wants to hear that their friend doesn't feel like there's really anything ""there"" between you and basically sees you as a stranger. I feel like such a terrible person because I should feel happy with my life and I should appreciate my friends and I do.. But I just can't take feeling so lonely anymore. 

I've wanted to kill myself for over a decade now, but I'm too much of a coward to go through with it. I've always thought ""I wish I would just die somehow"" but lately I've been struggling so much trying to cope with this that I've been planning how I should do it myself. I really don't know what else to do. But everything is either too painful and scary or not possible (I live in the UK so getting a gun is really hard)

I lost my job because of my anxiety and now I spend most days asleep. I had saved up a lot of money but now it's running out. Soon I won't be able to pay rent so I'll be kicked out too. I've had therapy and I've taken meds, I'm generally healthy, I don't know what else to do."

"""There must be a hell of a lot of people in the world like me, who want to die but haven't got the guts.""I'm K, 18 years old. I should feel lucky that I'm going to an Ivy League school this fall with a full ride. Yet, I've never felt so alone in all my life. I feel so unwanted, such a burden, so unneeded. At times I imagine myself downing a bottle of sleeping pills or hiding in my closet and just slitting my wrists, but I can't work up the courage to do it. I'm just wishing that maybe and hopefully a bus or a car just comes and hits me so I don't have to kill myself.

In groups, I've never felt so alone. I feel like I'm always the odd one out, or the outcast. This rang so true in the past couple of weeks. I participated in a pre-college summer program a month ago and I feel that no one notices me. While everyone had their own group of best friends, I felt like I was always an outlier. Then a couple of days ago, there was a student meetup in my area where a bunch of us who are going to the same college and live in the same area meet up. I hung out with this group, and all the guys were trying to flirt with this one girl and I was ignored -- they didn't even try to carry a conversation with me or even notice I was there. It was a huge blow to my self esteem; I've never felt so ugly. I kept asking myself, ""What is wrong with me?""

I feel that no matter how much effort I put in to try and socialize and put myself out there, no guy is ever going to be interested in me. Nobody likes me. I'm very jealous of other ""pretty"" girls, and especially people who have are surrounded by a lot of friends and have everything going for them. What do they have that I don't? Why is it that some people can be so lucky whereas luck just keeps fucking with my life?

I thought college was going to be differen but I feel as if it's like high school over again. High school has been hell for me in terms of loneliness. I've never had a boyfriend, never been kissed. And before college even starts, so many students already know each other and are hooking up. I feel so pessimistic about my prospects of making friends or starting a relationship.

Even in my family I feel like I'm such an outcast. I have a very kindhearted family, but sometimes I feel like I'm the ""odd one out"" because I'm the only one that is struggling with depression and is rebellious. My parents don't understand how I can be depressed and just tell me to ""go help myself"".

For a long time, I've struggled with feelings of worthlessness, loneliness, and a low self-esteem. My issues seem mundane, but when you're struggling with loneliness all your life, then maybe killing yourself wouldn't seem so bad. After all, no one would cry over me anyway.

I try doing the things I love, but for some reason I can't even work up the motivation to do that. I used to love writing stories, but I can't do that anymore; I feel that I'm not good enough. Everyday I just have this heavy feeling and I feel like crying for no reason.

I'm pretty sure one of these days, my cause of death is going to be suicide. I feel like I'm caught up in some sort of perpetual sadness; it comes and goes, but it never leaves entirely."

"High expectationsHi Iâm 14 and I come from a common hardworking Asian family in the U.S. Recently I have been criticized by my dad to the point where I broke down and almost attempted something that I really donât want to talk about. 
What stopped me is the past when my parents had time to care about me, my new friends, and my aunt and uncle that have given me the best childhood I had ever wanted.
Throughout my childhood slowly most of my close friends have moved away or stopped talking to me, because they have changed. Iâm only fourteen and i attend High school, so homework along with these problems really got to me as a person. My parents donât understand me and only look at me as a hopeless child at the times of depression. No support, no love, just high expectations ð

"mom is brokenfirst i'd just like to say thank you to everyone here in this subreddit for sharing their stories. reading the trouble you guys are going through help remind me i am not alone. i hope you can all find peace and happiness in your lives.

last night my mom had a drink. there's something wrong with her; every time she drinks, even if it's just 1 shot or 1 glass of wine, she changes into something else. it started when she had finished doing the dishes after dinner and my dad went to the kitchen and asked if he could help. she blew up. she didn't like that he came so late, and from there on everything turned into a nightmare. this happens about once a month.

she began screaming and throwing things. abusing my dad. she even shoved me around and nearly knocked me over a table in the living room. it got so bad that we had to call 911. she looked like she was hyperventilating and on the verge of losing consciousness; we were worried. she got 100x worse after we called them. she made us feel like villains, like we don't care about her. the police showed up, they tried talking to her and explaining things to her from a neutral standpoint. they could see what was happening and sided with my father, my brother and I. even the female officer was trying her hardest to explain that her family was just trying to be supportive. i can't say they were much help. she got worse after they left.

she's been threatening to either run away and never come back or kill herself. she's not feeling any better this morning, but she mentioned she was going to go to the mall later. maybe she needs that alone time. but now i'm worried i'll never see her again once she steps outside that door. she's in the shower now.

she refuses to see a doctor or therapist. she refuses to consider anti-depressants. she is just always miserable after having a drink, no matter how much we try to comfort her. she's too emotional. and she doesn't seem to understand it always makes things worse by drinking, yet she still does it. she is not an alcoholic, she doesn't drink everyday, she just can't handle ANY alcohol.

i've been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a long time. i consider myself a pretty strong and resilient person and i know i have it pretty good compared to a lot of others. i don't think i will kill myself, but this weekend is a tough one. i'm scared.

when she's not like this she is the best mom in the world. thank you all for listening.

edit:
she just left to go shopping. i hugged her and cried and told her to please come back after. she didn't seem to care."
"How do I tell this to my therapist?I have a plan and I don't know if I can keep myself from committing to it on my own. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow. I rationally know I need to tell her. But because of my emotions I am avoiding anything and everything that could help me feel better or make me change my mind because I don't want to start doubting myself and I just want this (pain, life) to be over. How do I tell my therapist this? "

"Feel like I should be in a trash bagJust about everything seems to be going wrong with no way out. I was very close to an actual suicide attempt not even a few days ago, but it still feels like I should've gone through with it. I lost my job, have no money, stopped speaking and hanging out with close friends a while ago for no reason, and just recently feel like I lost my fiancÃ©. It's just a huge mess and it feels like all is lost. I just don't know what to do."

"Please, help me. I've (24nb) suffered from sever depression and anxiety since I was 13 years old, and maybe even before then. Alongside that i have a chronic pain condition that makes my life not only emotionally painful, but physically painful too.
 To make a long story short, it's now making it impossible to live a normal life. In the past two years, I've had to have 4 months out of work each year. I've been signed off sick again now due to a meltdown I had at work two weeks ago. I self harmed while at the workplace and I fear that I'm going to lose my job, either for the amount of time I've had to take off sick, or because I technically bought a weapon into work to self harm with (it was the blade from a pencil sharpener so nothing major, but that's beside the point; it's the principle)
 It's been just over a year since I last tried to take my life, and I'm dancing on a knife-edge about trying again. I'm nearly Â£10,000 in debt and struggling living pay check to pay check as it is, without having to pay back my debts. I can't eat, I can't sleep and I can't work so I'm really struggling with the idea of carrying on living. I honestly don't see the point any more."

"Iâm everything that doesnât belong here and Iâm gonna end it tonight.Iâm 19 and turning 20 soon, and Iâm attracted to 16-18 year old boys. I know this is wrong and bad and I want to hurt myself because of it. Iâm also out on bond for multiple felonies involving grand theft and armed burglary, and I just donât see this life mattering much anymore. The idea of staying alive just so I can graduate university without a career or opportunity to rent an apartment is pointless. Iâm not welcome here and Iâm the reason for that. My actions are the reason my life is over. ALL I had to do was get help and be more involved when I was younger but now Iâm a useless criminal thief whoâs gonna be looked at as a pedophile later in life. I know what my next steps are, and theyâre gonna have to be taken in the next few hours.

I got an AR15 rifle and Iâm gonna walk up the street with it to a back road I used to walk on when I was depressed as a teen. Iâm gonna commit suicide there because I canât solve any of my issues, and I donât have a real desire to continue this life now. I am, however, excited to leave earth early. I may even get to reincarnate and try again!!! My birthday present to myself in the next few hours is suicide, and Iâm extremely excited to end it early. Goodbye!"
"Guys, it's been two years and growing; but I've realized that suicide my be the only way I can be happy.I am not a funny guy. I am not interesting or entertaining. Iâm that one guy who has zero to contribute to the conversation except my presence. I really have tried but after each attempt I am left no better than feeling stupid or worthless. My group of friends care about me but I think just because Iâve been around them a while. I look at their situation and see myself as someone who is easily replaceable. If I left, all I would be is an empty spot on the couch. Conversations would go on, activities would resume and the world will rotate as if nothing happened. Even when I talk to my family it seems distant in conversation and emotion. The only feeling I get out of the conversation with them is anger or nagging about how Iâve disappointed them again.  I have tried finding someone special to be with, a girlfriend but never had any success. Believe me. I have tried hard! but after all high school, two years of college and no successes, I just feel lost and done. Iâve only kissed two girls. This isnât a sudden feeling, it has been growing for the past two years. The one person who has made me feel best in the past two years I havenât even known. If Iâm no one to others and myself, what is really the point of carrying on. All I see in my futures is student loans and work. Life, it seems, is just not meant for me."

I donât want to get into details but Iâve been really scared, sad, and lonely because Iâm considering leaving this world, I even tied my scarf to my door handle to see if it was secure enough to work. I just started seeing a therapist and I plan to go on some meds to help me get out of this rut. I hope it works, I feel like my days are numbered...

I've suffered from depression since I was 13, and things have not improved. I've merely destroyed the lives of my friends, and now I'm alone, and honestly, I deserve that. Loneliness is a fitting punishment for a horrible human being like me.

I'm a disgusting creature. I do nothing but consume resources, and contribute nothing back. My life is a perverted corruption of humanity, and I shouldn't exist."

"Does anyone remember a life calculator website? I remember when we were learning about money and stuff in middle school we went on a website where we went step by step with how expensive a home we wanted, how much a pet would add, how much a car payment would be, how expensive entertainment and movies would be, how much babies are, ect.

"thinking about doing*it* againsorry for bad english.

I attempted suicide in the last 3 months and my family didnt even know about it. I hid my neck bruises from them and corrected my hoarseness of my voice because of the rope. 

Every night I think about doing it again. University is making me anxious and I feel really terrible because I am not catching up on my classes and I am not attending my labs anymore. I feel bad because my dad pays for my study and I wasted everything. I am thinking of jumping from the 8th floor of our research building but that would be really selfish for other students seeing me dead on my pool of blood or even my parents seeing me dead in my bedroom closet with a rope. 

I am losing my mind, even reaching a therapist makes me anxious. :(

"So hopelessI'm 19 years old. Background: I have OCD and anxiety issues. 
I feel like such a fucking dumbass. Last year at this time I started feeling ""foggy"". It's so hard to describe but it's hell on earth. It feels like I'm a little drunk, like I can't focus on things, like I have a clouding of consciousness. It's absolute torture 24/7. Well, the doctors told me it was anxiety after a ton of tests, and I was put on an SSRI. I gradually got better and eventually returned basically to normal. In come alcohol. Of course I can't drink like a normal person. Of course I HAD to have the personality where I binge every time like a fucking irresponsible dumbass. I drank regularly for the last 7-8 or so months. In that time I've blacked out probably 4-6 times. Each time it happened I told myself I would change but i couldn't. I'm weak. I can't drink like a normal person. Well, I could just quit drinking, and have decided to completely quit. But, this is where my original story comes in. The awful feeling, the torture, the complete hell on earth, is back. My mind feels like it's only half on and there's nothing I can do to fix it. It happened after I was a dumbass and blacked out AGAIN. I'm so stupid, if I had just drank like somebody who had half a goddamn sense of intelligence I'd be fine. But no, I can't. I woke up the day after and noticed my mind was back in the torture. Back in the fucking thick of it. What if it's permanent this time? So here I am, trapped in my own version of fucking hell and I can't even say it's not my fault I guess. All I think about for half of the day is how I can end the suffering. I've had to start taking Xanax just to calm down enough to stay alive. "

"I need a gunMy entire life has been a big fuck up. When I was 6 my parents got divorced and I had to go to my dad's house where he would abuse me physically and mentally. Now I'm 14 and I'm close to falling school and have no people who care about me. People tell me it will get better but every day I get up and it gets even worse. Almost everyday I wish I was an abortion in one of my mom's periods or I die in a car crash. This is going to be my 12 attempt of suicide and I need a gun to make sure I don't survive. I have tried going to therapists but thry just make me see how I should end my life. A lot of the time my ""friends"" will make fun of me for my religion and I really don't blame them. I weight 180 pounds, have a stub for a penis, and hope that once I die my mom and dad will see it as a message as how terrible of parents they are. If anyone owns a gun I really need one thanks."
"Death is my only way out of this hellhole of a relationshipMy boyfriend is the last good thing in my life. The last thing to give me strength and push me to keep going. Or at least he was until he became a cold abusive monster. Weâve been together for 5 years and I loved him so much. I still love him but I donât know why Iâm still with him. Probably because Iâm terrified to be alone and I still am holding onto the last shred of hope that he will change.

He cheats on me compulsively, when heâs angry with me he doesnât let me leave the house and physically blocks me from leaving, hell kick or shove me, anytime Iâm talking  about anything Iâm slightly interested in he talks down to me like Iâm stupid, he forces me to have sex with him and guilt trips me when I donât, I told him he was turning out to be a monster like his dad and he kicked and stomped on me on floor while calling me a stupid bitch.

I was always sad, but I still had a small sparkle. I used to bubble up when talking about my favorite tv shows or hobbies, I used to be the life of the party, i was always sad but sometimes I could be really fucking happy.

Thatâs all completely gone now though. Iâm a shell of the person I once was. He took away everything from me and I let him. Iâm such pathetic fucking loser. 

Despite the feelings of worthlessness and misery he brings me, he is all I have. Itâs either him or Iâm alone, and I canât handle being alone. Death will be my only sweet escape from this nightmare of a relationship and life and I just canât wait for it to be here. I know it will be soon, whenever I can save up enough money to buy a shit ton of Xanax or heroine. I donât do drugs but I know they will kill me. Iâll make sure he finds my body and knows he did this to me."
"Does it bother anyone else that when people list the sexes/genders, they almost always put men first? People always say âmen and womenâ âboys and girlsâ âhe/sheâ for example. Very few people say âwomen and menâ âgirls and boysâ âshe/heâ. It isnât necessarily a problem to list men first but it seems like most people do it, and I think itâs because society has discriminated against women in a lot of ways, and most people just naturally put men first because thatâs what society has basically taught us to do. If you do this, Iâm not saying youâre a sexist, Iâm saying a lot of society is sexist."

Whenever i do something I like to ask myself ""Why do i do this ?""

Why do i need to go to school ? To get a good job.

Why do i need to get a good job ? To earn money.

Why do i need to earn money ? To buy what i need.

Why do i need to buy what I need ? So I can go to the job.

And the vicious cycle began.

It's just feel pointless, to the point, that I feel like living is worthless.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I get good grades in school my mum goes ""I'm proud of you"" and whenever I get bad grades in school my mum goes ""I'm taking away your phone and laptop""

Why does it matter so much, that I get some stupid number on a worthless test ?

Why am I considered to be a bad student, when I can't learn the FUCKING LITERATURE ? Even when I get good grades at every other subjects ?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just done with everything. But mostly with myself.

I'm trapped in my mind, and i can't escape even when the cell is open.

I took part in a online course where I learned about the art of sales. I learnt it because I wanted to get out of school.

But guess what ? I took zero action, and isolated myself, so noone could even help me.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't live with myself, I'm just not wothy for living.

I agree with the ""Operate on a principal of ""Help those who help themself"""", and I can't even help myself, not even a bit.

So what's the point of livining if i can't help myself.

&amp;#x200B;

This post is a jack of all trades, because I'm feeling a bit dizzy all day, and can't concentrate very well.

"âIt gets betterâ âjust put yourself out thereâ âjust work on yourselfâ. Itâs all bullshit to try and stop me from killing myself.How fucking selfish can people be that they see a person who suffers enough that they want to die every day, and their first thought is to try and bullshit them into prolonging that suffering.

At what age is it acceptable for me to just kill myself because Iâm a pathetic failure of a human being? There is no acceptable age to these people. Theyâd rather I live a shit life solely so they donât have to have the inconvenience of feeling kinda bad when they hear I died.

Iâm depressed. Unemployed. Mentally ill. Ugly as fuck. A virgin whoâs never had a relationship. 

But hey, just keep pushing on through, youâre only 10 years behind everyone else in basic fucking human experiences so far. Iâm sure itâll work out if you keep trying hahahaha

Well fuck that. Iâm so fucking tired of failing. Iâm tired of feeling bad all the time.

I tried searching for help in a time in which I frequently dissociated, but no one had room to take me in. 

I just gave up, honestly I don't give a shit anymore. I won't look for help any longer, its just more depressing. If I make it: fine. If not: even better.

"How do I give support for someone I'm growing to despise?Little background: Few years ago my parents got a divorce and my mom began a (somewhat abusive) relationship with someone. Last year my dad died.

Shortly before my dad's funeral it became evident to my mom that she was being cheated on and the dude was going to leave her. So at our dad's funeral my mom was crying, not because her ex-husband had died but, because her boyfriend had left her (I know that my parents marriage had ended and she didn't need to feel bad about it, but to me it was extremelly disrespectful to me and my siblings --- at the moment nobody knew why she was so sad). Few days later, we were stil mourning our dad's death and the reason for her sadness showed up...

Now because her boyfriend have left her she is treatning to kill herself. Jesus Christ, My 50 years old mother is treatning to kill herself because her 36 years old boyfriend have left her!

She became insuferable, her facebook is filled with disgusting messages, posts and whatnot about how everyone is garbage and life have no meaning; she have turned away any attempt of help from any relative. She treats her 73 yo mother like shit (I believe that in her head my grandma have something to do with her being dump). She spent her new years eve on a psych clinic but isn't taking any medicine because of no apparent reason and I think that she is straight up lying to her doctors.

She is just making the lives of everyone miserable (and for me, because of the most retarded reason possible) and I don't know how to deal with it... before I try to help and just making everything worse: how do I give support if I can't stand her reasons and am in fact disgusted by it and by her actions? What should I do?

I am aware that I am the asshole in the situation for not respecting her reasons and being in general pissed at my own mother; don't need to bring that up. Or bring it, I don't know.

I'm nothing more than an anxiety-riddled mess, who's to scared to live his own damn life. I'm 26 and I have no dreams, no ambition. My whole life I suffered from social anxiety, always having the feeling I'm being judged by everybody. Never feeling good enough.

Never has anyone expressed interest in me even when I tried my hardest. But I'm a short, genetically skinny fucker, who isn't attractive. Balding, receding hairline. I inherited everything that is considered unattractive I have. Bullied my whole damn life and when I finally escaped them I can't even begin to even love a ounce of myself.

The fucking anxiety, loneliness and worthlesness is just to much for me. I rather die now than live through this another fucking 20 years."
"I just ragequitted playing a videogame by yelling for the first time ever and scared my little brother I was playing Left 4 Dead 2 Last Man Standing mode and I was on The Passing finale, I filled the generator to the max and then this dumb game decides to throw all the special infected in the world at me getting me cornered by a jockey that ended up killing me literally a second before reaching the car to escape. My brother came to my room worried thinking I was having a heart attack or something I yelled at him in the heath of the moment and now I feel bad :("

aw wtf why did you say that

itâs not a literal voice i donât think but i swear mine always tells me to kill myself and he goes away sometimes but every time the slightest thing happens he comes back and is like hey you wonât miss that when your gone

"How should I tell my parents I am going to die.I posted this on advice, but unsurprisingly nobody gave a shit and like 2 people just replied telling me to go to the doctor. I figure you guys think about this stuff a lot and so might be able to help me.

Ive been depressed for &gt;10 years so im quite looking forward to dying to be honest, im just worried about my parents.


Iâm fairly certain I have throat cancer. Ive been smoking unfiltered cannabis cigarettes with tobacco for like 10 years, ive been hoarse and had a lump on my throat for longer than 6 months. I donât care that I have cancer but im really worried about telling my parents. Theyâre both depressed because they are in shitty financial situation since my dad had to stop working because of chronic back pain. One of out cats went missing and then was found dead several weeks later last year and they both fell to pieces and mourned the cat for weeks. I really donât want them to do anything stupid when I tell them but im worried they will. I feel terrible because I know this will ruin their lives. I havenât even been to the doctors because I am worried the doctor will tell them. Also I donât want to die in a hospital bed I want to die at home with my cats and I donât want to spend the last days I have where I can be active feeling shitty because chemo and I really donât want to spend the rest of my life with a hole in my throat, Iâd rather be dead. Overall im ambivalent about dying which makes me feel even worse for doing this to my parents.

thanks for your help"
"i hate class participation grades I love Spanish class, but the participation grades suck. I'm good(ish) at Spanish. But I just hate participation grades.

Today we we're talking about favorite music artists as an intro-acitivty, and the teacher asked us our favorite artists.

I like Doja cat, nicki minaj, lady gaga, destiny's child.

im a guy.

"I feel weirdly proud of myself So for a while now Iâve kinda struggled with anxiety stuff. Iâve never been diagnosed properly but its pretty obvious that I have some level of anxiety.

This can often make social interactions tough. But today was a bit different.

I was trying to get to my seat when someone way blocking the isle. What I usually do is just wait till they move or notice me. But today I just asked if I could quickly get by. They moved and I said thanks. It went well

"Merry Christmas, no one loves youUgh I hate holidays cause everyone always has the perfect family and are able to get gifts but my family is broken up and hates each other so no one has any fun, the holiday passes, and nothing changes. No happiness, no fond memories, just poverty and wanting to shoot myself in the face. Same goes with my birthday, or any other holiday where you're supposed to be around each other and have fun. God I wish I was dead so I could be in Heaven and chill. I hate this world. Nothing for me here. If you weren't born lucky then you're fucked."
"I want my life to change... because I can't live this anymoreI am in an abusive relationship that I stay in because I always make excuses for him.  I had only my friends left, who I had doubted really cared about me, and today it was kind of confirmed they don't even like me and I think have been humoring me as to not hurt my feelings.


I apparently have no social skills.  I get a friend and I am willing to do anything for that friend but have absolutely no idea how to read their signals.  This is one thing that pisses my boyfriend off too.  Because of this I end up doing harmless things that end up pissing people off, and i can never tell they are angry.   I apparently ruined all of my friendships by doing this, and only found out today.  Of course I was too stupid and oblivious to even realize there had been problems taht started about a year ago.  I judt had no clue.  I was really blindsided by this information.  


I don't have any family but my mother.  She has no friends, no family, nothing, even my sister has disowned her and i am the only one still in contact with her.  she has munchausen by proxy and has... well... things were rough growing up.  When I am in her life I am enabling her, when I'm out of it she has literally no one and starts talking about suicide.


So today I came to the realization I have no one really.  you know 5, 6 years ago I knew I was a social idiot but I thought I had changed.  I guess not.  I don't have much hope for myself at this point.  "

"Feeling just like I shouldn't be anymore.Don't really know why I'm posting this. Not going to kill myself right now but the thought keeps creeping in. 

I had such a strong will to live before that I never thought I'd even consider it. Now I just think that I'm such a bad person and go through so much shit I could just be at peace for once. 

The only time I'm at peace is when I'm sleeping and now I can barely do that. I just don't understand the point if it all. It's all just suffering and pain even when I'm trying to make others happy. I can't make myself happy for more than a few hours. Even that is hard. I just want it all to stop and now I don't really know what matters anymore."

"What the fuck did I just drink??? I was at a private party - 7 people. I knew everyone there. We bought some beers, bottle of wiskey, brandy and some energy drinks. Later in the night we ran out of drinks and my friend's gf suggested she can bring out a bit of homemade stuff that her mom makes from her basement. We agreed and she brought something that she claimed had ~60â° alchohol. It was like drinking fire but realy easy to down, nice flavour and I didn't even need to drink something like cola to down it more easily. Got me fucked up in few mins. Realy strong, clean alchohol high. Me and my gf were the only ones who drank it (she did 1 shot and I did 3). Next day I had visual, audio and sensory halucionations - on the bottomn corners of my FOV I saw realy detailed smoke every time I exhaled and when I closed my eyes I could hear my gf breathing in my face and even saying something, just like in that moment when we drank this stuff. I thought it was just me and didn't tell anyone but later I saw on my gf's insta story that she had absolutely same things going on - smoke everywhere and she kept feeling my breath on her face. I am realy weirded out. Has anyone heared of a halucionations from alchohol? We both were on alchohol, nicotine, caffeine and sleep deprived for 30+ h when this happened but real weird that we had the same effects. Even today I can barely see a small haze on my FOV when I look for it. What the fuck?"

I am sick of my main work.. however I am heading into the body mod industry quite well which is really the only thing that is keeping me motivated to see how my life will play out. But regardless.. I am devastatingly exhausted, I work all week, no days off between the two jobs and when I am not working I am running around doing something else. The only time I rest is when I sleep and it is never enough anymore. I am beyond burnt out and yet I am drowning in everything I have procrastinated to do.. my room is a pigs din and so is my car. I have barely any time or energy to work on mandatory art projects for my mentor and I just feel I will never get anything done. I paid off my credit cards recently and am still back into debt because I am extremely irresponsible and I find job in buying things. I have a girlfriend as well.. she is one of my comforts but it doesn't change how much of a mess I am in. Idk what the point of this post is. But I find myself frequenting gun shops.. I have enough to buy one. But I am trying to hold off for now.. cause once I do there wont be much time left for me. thanks for anyone who reads this.. I am not even depressed atm, I just feel so suffocated and exhausted.. my head is a tornado.. I want the chaos to stop."
"Would you leave enough for your partner to die too?When I go, I'd feel bad not leaving a way for my partner to go. I've been suicidal for 20 years and it's been very hard finding a method, and I hate the idea of leaving her to suffer in this world. But I'd then be responsible for homicide or even murder. And maybe she wouldn't want to die and it would enable her to do something she didn't really want to do."

"I'm alone. 18/MNot going to lie, these past few days changed my perspective on friends and family. I got kicked out of the house for fighting with my younger brother 2 days ago, and I was close to being homeless without a car, driver's license, friends, or any survival skills. However, my (non-biological) Aunt and Uncle decided to let me stay at their place for a bit. It's temporarily so I won't be here for long.

Before I got kicked out, all I did was play video games, browse reddit, and hang out with my siblings to escape my depression. I had only one friend (my choice, as I was asocial) who cut me off after I ignored him for 2 weeks. We've been friends since 5th grade but my misconstrued thinking told me he was being a nuisance and I didn't need him. 

Now, all I want is security and this ""I'm alone"" feeling to go away. I'm scared shitless knowing I can't go back to my old life of comfort, and even more scared of the fact that from now on, when shit hits the fan I will have no one to turn to, no one to fall back on. 

I'm making a plan to be self sufficent, for example getting a job and getting an apartment, but I'm just terribly depressed. I have no idea what to expect these next couple of weeks and unless I play my cards right, there's a high probability I'll be homeless. And alone.

The feeling of depression was always here, but now it's eating me alive to the point where suicide looks viable right now. I've already gotten a taste of homelessness and I'll do anything not to end up there, even if it takes me hanging myself. Suicide was always on my mind since high school, but now it's one of my few options left.

My life could go anywhere right now. I could be dead or homeless within the next few weeks, or I could be financially stable and be roommates with my cousin in Grand Rapids (he's living with my uncle trying to move out), eventually going onto college to be a librarian as I always wanted to be. It all depends on whether or not I'm able to go outside my comfort zone and make the right decisions and of course, luck.

"I just wanna share my storyIâve never been normal, I have problems I also grew up with a lot of abuse. I never can let anything go and my mind goes crazy. At one point I was so depressed that I truly thought about suicide. I suffer from UC so not only was it emotional but physical. I started being afraid of death and even feeling like there was no point. My depression got really bad, I donât know wha caused it but it was intense. I began planning to kill myself I wrote a suicide note and threw it out. I was going to make letters for each of my family, I planned to leave late at night and overdose in the apartment parking lot near me. I planned to text my husband as I did it, I became so upset that I was excited for death, I felt bad cause of my kid. I was thinking to myself the pain is so bad and death canât be any worse. Well I started suffering from panic attacks I felt like I was in danger all the time. Finally I gave in and I got on medication. It has helped me a great deal and I wish I would have done it sooner. What stopped me also was one day I just thought to myself âI want to be happy.â Despite not knowing what happens after and the pain I endure I realized only I could stop it. Now Iâm not saying itâs everyoneâs fault that basically itâs your decision. No itâs hard please get help donât do it alone, I suffered years and because of meds I pulled through. I never want to feel the way I felt than...it was intense."

School is legit waiting for everyone to get infected and making everyone depresed and then blaming other things for it."
"Just don't care anymore....Best way to describe it. Am 25 and have had clinical since I was 13. No friends, no job, no self-esteem, no gf, no life. I have gotten used to living  with constant clinical depression and anxiety, but after 12 years of it I really just don't care anymore. I don't want to exist anymore, every night I pray I die in my sleep or have some freak accident that kills me. Tried therapy, tried medication, tried CBT and nothing seems to take away any of the pain I constantly feel. I just wish I had the courage to step in front of the train that goes by my house, but I'm too scared. I've tried killing myself by od'ing on opiates, but never works as I always wake up. I will never find happiness or the feeling of content. I cannot connect with people and live in complete isolation. i just want this all to end..."

"What a sick jokeSince I was little, I knew something was off. Always pitied, looked down and ""left aside"", all of it in my ""family"" environment still. At school, teachers would rather whisper with others about me than talk directly to me. And when they did, feigning normalcy, it was all the usual ""study, yes"", ""you'll reach nowhere without effort, yes"". Fucking bullshit.

I grew up with the mindset I had to prove myself the best to be worth the bare minimum, and to punish myself over every little failure. And I did so. Result? Nothing. All the way, seeing others being granted stuff so naturally, but never attaining nothing on my own.

Nothing. Fucking nothing. Absolutely nothing. Nothing will ever change, never. No matter how much effort I put, I'll always be disregarded.

So why? Why did you guys dragged me for so long? Why I had to go through all of it just to left to die? There isn't a day in which I feel puking out of hatred.

About loneliness. 
I scream a lot of demeaning lonely thoughts at myself. 
I feel like maybe itâs my fault that Iâm alone, but who am I kidding OF COURSE itâs my fault. But then I get overwhelmed with joy and thoughts of âmaybe this loneliness isnât what I thought it wasâ but then I shoot it down to the ground cause Iâve been alone a lot lately. In spite of this new depression I still donât know who I am or where Iâm going. And honestly, I donât care who I am or where Iâm going because this sadness is who I am and this loneliness is where Iâm headed. So it all seems pointless... 
the other night I went on a drive and instead of singing along to the sad music in my car like usual I screamed every first word that came to my mind, and I cursed at god or the lack thereof and I cursed at life and the world and in that moment, I felt honest. 
I showed up at a bridge in our city overlooking the snake river next to some big waterfalls, and I climbed to the top. And I almost jumped, but 2 fears stopped me, the fear of going to hell and the fear of not dying. Only 2 fears. And I was 1 step away from possibly finding either. (I feel like this is a scattered post but ya, my thoughts are really scattered too.) 
Anyways... I feel lonely. And thatâs nothing new. But, itâs getting overwhelming.

As I near 30 having lived a life barely worthy of a post-it note, I hope more for the courage to end myself rather than the strength to pick myself up. It's a strange thing when suicide seems like an easier solution than reclaiming your life but I never had much to reclaim anyway.

It don't have a horrible life by most standards. I have a family who loves me and a place to call home, even if I don't pay for it as someone my age probably should be in the position to do. I quit my job back in December in some misguided belief that it was the thing keeping me from realizing my true purpose in life and perhaps it was if my only purpose was to give up.

I have no friends outside of the few I text with, tiny words on a tiny screen as I sit in the chair of my room for 95% of the day. Love is certainly out of the question and always has been. The closest I ever got to even a glimpse of that side of human interaction was an innocent kiss in the third grade. There had been a couple hopefuls between then and now, but hope was all I was able to muster and it was entirely one-sided. I don't have the type of personality to attract the romantic attentions of women and never will. I can't even bring myself to spring for an escort cause I feel even they would reject me, despite it being their job to do the complete opposite. I am ugly even if you ignore my outward appearance.

I feel so lost, thoughts of suicide being the only constant in my life, a comfort in the promise of an end. The pain my parents would feel is my biggest deterrent at the moment but I'm finding more and more moments throughout the day where that doesn't matter. I would only need to be elsewhere when I give in, away from others to avoid being discovered in such a state. That would certainly lessen the blow.

But life the words in the title, I'm insignificant. My problems are small, I am small, a blip on a radar no one is sure they even saw. It will all end someday and I will have never known true satisfaction or happiness. I won't know what a passionate kiss feels like or to look in the eyes of someone who loves me back. I'll never accomplish any tasks that improve the world in a significant way. I'll never see the world. I'll never laugh without a care in the world with a group of true friends.

I'll never be ok. That is an absolute truth. I'm just sitting here, in this chair, awaiting the resolve to make my unheard exit. Let it be soon."
Breaking down aginWish all you guys can walk in my shoes. Donât think there is any point existing. I want to die. My daughters going to be hurt. I donât deserve shit in life. I wish god can take my hand and show me that Iâll be ok. No point

What does hanging feel like?Has anyone tried it or experienced something similar? It's one of my only options right now.
i really suck at picking up hints i have missed on alot because of this
"What should I get for a former student of mine who just got a full ride to her dream school? Hello young people,

I'm a middle school teacher working in a large urban district. One of my former students, who is brilliant, hardworking, and kind, just got a full ride to a very competitive university. We've stayed in touch over the years, and she'd occasionally check in when she needed help with something or just to say hi. When she told me she was accepted, I was ecstatic for her and congratulated her.

I asked if I could share the news with our school's staff, since we always love to hear about our former students' successes, and she told me that she's feeling like she may have made a mistake. She says she's feeling some serious imposter syndrome (she's a POC, and this school is largely white and affluent), and she's worried she can't hack it. I told her that she can definitely hack it, and we talked for a while, but it still seemed at the end like she's feeling more than what I'd say is the ""normal"" amount of anxiety about a life transition.

I'm just thinking about my experience (as a privileged white dude) in college and how hard it was, and I'd like to get some of our staff to chip in to buy her something nice as a reassurance that she can, in fact, thrive there.

So my question for the younger folks here is: what should we get her? Her family doesn't have a ton of money, so I was thinking maybe a laptop would be nice, or gift cards, or...what? I haven't been to college since before Facebook was a thing, so I don't want to arrange to get her something that won't be useful.

Anyway, thanks in advance!"
"Not even sure if this is the correct subreddit.I'm not even sure if this is the correct subreddit to post this as I've never really said to myself, YES suicide is the option, suicide is the only way out I must fucking kill myself. I really don't know what replies I expect from random redditors if I do end up getting any at all but it just feels weird. I'm only 15 and I haven't felt genuine happiness in a long time. When I do it's always dependent on someone or something else that's never in my control. Sometimes i just want time to pass quicker, then I remember that after a few more years of studying I'll find a job, work that shit for a few more decades and probably just die, and that's if I'm being optimistic and I don't get hit by a car or die in some tragic accident. Everyone around me is starting to find hobbies that lead to a certain profession/job they enjoy. 

I on the other hand used to love to do a lot of things but have recently started loosing interest in pretty much everything. Even before, after some of the shittiest days of my life I could come back home and play some random game or talk to someone. Don't get me wrong, those games are still here and the people I could talk to still are but It doesn't seem to make me happy anymore. 

As I said - I don't really know what reply to expect, I know motivation won't help, atleast for more than 5 seconds. I will never kill myself - that's for sure - but I still don't know what to do."
"I hope my neck breaks on impact and I dieIâm going to jump off of a bridge next semester. Hopefully I will destroy enough bones and organs in my body to the point where I will die instantly. 

There are others who were robbed of their lives at a very early age. Some of them actually had the desire to live longer. I wish I could trade places with them. 

I donât deserve to be alive. I am a lazy waste of human existence that wants to do absolutely nothing with their life."

"Why live""don't drink alcohol because it'll fuck up your brain"" but what if my brain is already fucked up sober?

I'm a 27 male, cancer survivor (brain tumor at age 8) and idk how I'm still alive. I've got like 30% of vision left, most of it in my left eye,y right eye has gone lazy from lack of use apparently. Also deaf from both ears die to the chemotherapy. On top of that I have a speech problem. Did I forget to mention that I have a golf ball size hole in my head where my pituitary gland was?

So, with all that, idk how I'm still alive and how I haven't suicided yet. From an outsider view, guess I'm doing well, got an 80k career job with lots of benefits and a master's degree but 30hr drive from my family. But I don't have a girlfriend or best friend for even a friend here, just a roommate and a bunch of co-workers/people from work. I don't have anyone to truly talk to, no one that shares my same interests and never have ever since I was born. Always felt like an outsider. Only been invited to 2 birthday parties and that was pre-cancer. My older brother who had more potential died from a hit-and-run on his motorcycle. My mom who used to say ""why can't you be more like your brother?"" now says ""why can't you be a normal person?"". (jokingly?) 
I currently live 2,000 miles from home, can't drive, can barely hear (can never hold a conversation let alone a group one cuz I can't hear shit.) I feel alone and trapped. Can't drive, too blind, can never be an independent man. Always at the mercy of others. What is life and is there a god/heaven?
I just want to die, reincarnate into a world like ""By the grace of Gods"" anime where I'm loved and appreciated, and also don't have this shitty body of mine.
Depression? It'll never go away. Mine is not based on money or other society struggles, but things I can never fix, like my vision, hearing, speaking.
I just want to stop suffering, and stop being alone."

"I don't think I was supposed to make it past childhood, and this haunts me.My childhood was tinted by sickness and loneliness. I remember being in kindergarten and during Christmas break, I was so sad and tired that I laid down on the floor and stayed there for as long as I could, until my parents forcibly moved me, with the intention to starve myself to death. I felt like a malfunctioning robot. As I continued to grow, it shifted into feeling like a wisp of a ghost's soul. It's as though I wasn't meant to be born here (or at least not as a human, perhaps as a fern on a jungle floor) and right away, nature realized its mistake and has been subtly trying to correct it. After two decades, I'm burnt out by those health obstacles and harbor such heavy, icy dread knowing they're never going to cease being present. I'm also tired of being lonely and feeling scared of people, of having a plethora of regrets already piled up and tumbling over in regards to things I did or didn't do, of year after year of knowing deep in my heart I have no prospects. I don't want anything to do with this gloomy life I'm stuck with...

I had a guiding moon through my last relationship but that guiding moon vanished once the relationship ended. I'd forgotten how hard it is to navigate alone. I feel like I'll never be able to recapture that essence of light and safety again with someone else even though I really, truly want to. It hit me tonight my desire is probably just a fantasy. This, too, compounds to make life worthless.

Lately I've started to become a bit reckless with myself. I do things every day to increase my chances of blood clot formation while knowing already I'm an individual who's at high risk of it, I'll purposely dehydrate and starve myself for a couple days even though I know my body is too sensitive, I keep using a medication despite it causing adverse reactions. These kinds of things. And although I realize it, I don't intend on changing my behavior. I wouldn't mind if my body were to finally just break permanently. I know a way to trigger a massive vasculitis flare within myself and for the past few days, every single day I ponder doing it. I'm not sure why exactly I don't yet, or what is stopping me from being the outright master of my fate. I guess because a wilted flower has no ability in any way, not even to further bend itself or shudder its final petals away."
"My biggest wish is to dieIm 18 yrs and the only thing on my mind is dying. Iâve never been depressed or went through a hard time in my whole life, i got tons of good friends, a lovely family and iâm economically independent(my parents money not mine). Even though i have a great life my biggest wish is to just die and disappear from everything but the last thing i want is my family and friends to suffer.

I want to die but i donât know how to make it happen with the least impact on my friends and family, please help.

The reason why i want to die is because i feel like thereâs nothing to life and that i doesnât deserve any of all the things i get.

I got nobody to talk to about my wish of dying, im about to go crazy having to live a single more day on this earth.

"Im doneI got harassed and assaulted for the last time today. I got choked and punched and scratched. This along with rampant suicidal thoughts is too much, I've got a revolver loaded and the hammer pulled back and im ready to go, no more of that shit. Forever"
"Not completely suicidal, but I really feel sad.My life is literally fine without my mother.

I have a decent grade at school (taking accelerated and advanced science and math courses with A's and A+ but i have s hit grades for English and History)

I used to be interested in History since I was a war/military enthusiast but I started bombing World History and I always get crappy grades in quizes after that year of WH.

But I don't really have a problem with that - getting into, say a science-oriented university isn't going to require A+'s in everything. Furthermore, my English and History grades are not bad (B's and B+'s) but my mother insists that I get A's. Although I believe that I should get the highest grades possible, it just isn't possible.

But my mother keeps on giving me threats, sometimes maybe over the line, like how she will

1. get rid of my stuff to ""**Inflict Pain**"" so i will understand (not a joke)
2. send me back to my home country (i'm currently in an american high school) and the education there is really bad and it is likely that after 4 years overseas, my academic performance in my home country will be beyond unimaginable
3. Shout at me in front of my sister to show that she hates me

You guessed it, fucked up family. She says she got sick of me since I am too nerdy and too reclusive and yet she thinks i slack around when it comes to English and Social studies.

And moving out isn't an option. I **absolutely need** to graduate here. Going back to my home country is worse than graduating with all D's. I'm not joking. She doesn't hit me, but I'd rather get beaten with a sledgehammer rather than endure all this shit.

EDIT: I also need to go to a good american university or my parents won't fund it. I know why she would say I need to get straight A's, but seriously, my school is one of the top in my region and it is near impossible for me to get an A in the two subjects. And that still doesn't explain why she is giving me a hard time. So my point is this: what do I need to tell her?

EDIT2: I'll come back after an hour. doing homework usually helps me wind down.

so reddit, i had a lot of fun here (on my main) and I know reddit is more than having fun. help."

"this is getting tiresomeA few years ago something happened which changed my perspective on life in general.  At the time, I had no history of mental illness =. I have since gone from no diagnosis to a diagnosis of PTSD to atypical depression- with various other things mixed in.

Unfortunately, I feel a strong intermittent pull toward suicide since this incident.  It's hard to describe, but it is like I feel more than someone who is ""numb"", but less than someone who cares about anything.  

I have been in therapy and do not feel like I will ""act on"" my feelings again, however these feelings are really interfering with my quality of life.
Just curious if anyone else is dealing with a similar situation."

I am tired of the nightmares, quilt, anger, sadness and everything else. I tired of remembering friends and then remembering the last moments. I cant live with the memories of watching someone slowly dim to nothing. I am tired of blaming myself for them not making it back, I was the medic, I was supposed to bring everyone home. I am tired of not waking up next to my wife. I cant keep seeing the fear in her eyes as I came out of a flashback, or the fear in her eyes as she is calling 911 after I took a bottle of pills, or as I was standing in front of the tub with a hot electrical cord in hands. I have lost everything, everyone I loved. I lost the kind good-natured person I was, I lost my humanity and for what. I just don't know if can pick myself up again if i can go on. I think about just walking away so many time through out the day I am just afraid I am going to do it one of these times."

"Just being OpenTo anyone who takes the time to read this, thank you:

I'm what you would consider an antisocial young adult. Homeschooled for the last 5 years with no friends. I don't have much self confidence (I'm short, among other things). I used to crave a relationship and I let it make me bitter.

I've been struggling with a pornography and masturbation addiction. I'm a Christian and it completely goes against everything I believe. I feel like the self worth issues and the addiction are very much related.

I've been apart of a group on reddit called Nofap Christians, and honestly it has been a God send for me. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for almost a year now. It almost feels like there is no reason to live sometimes. When I first joined I found freedom for nearly half a year and ended up falling back into the same lifestyle that made me miserable. It is so easy to feel like there is no hope. 

I can't count the number of times I've relapsed, and I feel like it is just taking one piece of me at a time. I don't want to get to the point where I don't care anymore. I've been so close to suicide before. I've got a caring family and a few people I know who I really care for. Sometimes I just feel like it wouldn't matter if I was gone. 

The isolation doesn't help. I don't get out a ton and its terrifying trying to make friends. I'm great when I know a person but meeting people is absolutely terrifying. That fear keeps me where I am at, and I don't like it. I don't know where I am going with this post, but I just feel like things are hopeless. I can put on a smile but there are times I am really struggling with wanting to live. 

If you've made it this far, thank you.

Stopping Suicidal ThoughtsI keep having suicidal thoughts and vague plans as to how to go about this. I don't feel much of a compulsion to act on them but I've been having them since before Christmas and on and off throughout my life since I was about 12. Currently I feel a bit hopeless and lacking motivation but my enthusiasm fluctuates a bit. Been having a difficult time at work and really struggling with nerves before j go in to work. Feeling sick etc. I don't want to go on meds and don't see much point in therapy. Just looking for some advice. Would daily suicidal thoughts indicate a mental health issue? Thanks

"Sometimes I wonder if maybe I should just commit suicideI'm not really planning on it, but sometimes I find myself thinking that it would be a relief so often, that I don't know why my mind is still averse to the thought of actually doing it. I mean I still have a few basic reasons not to, like the fact that it would hurt some people, and I genuinely worry that if I commit suicide it might trigger one or two more, and I always want to imagine that I'll figure things out someday.

But the thought of dying sounds so relieving. I never feel relief in my life. Relief is super rare but I still keep doing things and pushing forward and I feel like this lack of relief will always keep me too demotivated to make positive changes. So why not just end it?

Sometimes though, I wish someone in my personal life would hear my problems and instead of getting uncomfortable or having some typical reaction, would actually be concerned and just give me an understanding ear."

"HELP ME (going out with a guy) Hey everyone! I'm 17 and this is my first time going out with a guy since 4 years. Let me start off with some background information first. I met this guy about 4/5 year ago and we were friends for a while, then we started dating for about 8 months. I fell in love with him instantly but I was a kid so I just broke up with him because I want to ""spice up"" my life. We then didn't talk for about a year but reconnected during the summer of 2019 on Instagram. Since then, we've basically talked almost everyday. Keep in mind that I never sent him any of pics so he doesn't even know what I look like today because I've been super insecure about myself. The insecurity started a while after we broke up although he liked me even when I was ugly. He asked me out (idk if as a date or just friends) for next week. Im totally shitting my pants because what if he thinks im ugly? What if I don't know what to say or talk about? What if he realizes that he wasted his time with an insecure b\*tch like me all this time?

&amp;#x200B;

Idk why I keep overthinking things especially since he used to be practically in love with me when I was going through my awkward phase. But now that a lot of things changed about me physically (they became better), I just don't know what to expect his reaction to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Please give me advice on what to do on that date or if I should even go and also please throw at me any tips on how to be less insecure because I hate it about myself."
"Help.... please. I don't want to die.Before I start here is some basic context. I am 28 years old male. I live in California at home with family. 

I am not here to mope. I am not here to complain incessantly about my current circumstance and I understand that context is needed for full understanding. But I have these conflicting issues of what I am allowed to share, what I should share, and what is appropriate. My concerns are that what I want to say will be taken lightly, or less seriously, or just contrived emotions, dramatics,or instability.

**I suffer from Complex PTSD.** I am a child abuse survivor. I grew up in a home that damaged me not only physically but psychologically as well. I went to therapy seeked medical advice, take medication and evaluate myself so critically with attempts at objectiveness to prevent biased remarks or unclear evaluations.

**I don't feel like I am being taken seriously.** Or how severe my circumstances are. I am actually quite lucky in terms of living situation but in terms of mental health I am at my limit. Most of the time people tell me to suck it up or tell me it will get better with time. But I see all this coddling in current generation and how things are and my circumstance and it drives me mad with frustration.

I have a lot to say I guess about what I can and cant control and finding resources to get out of this situation. And its terrifying for me to open up which is why this is a throw away account.

**I don't feel confident or capable like I used to be.**

I know I am rambling and avoiding directness but I don't know how to convey all the information clearly and concisely with all the context and information. But I will try.

I was born in California in a nice home in the suburbs. Went to school, and pursued a career in the arts, specifically design. My childhood was raised by Filipino Grandmother with abusive parenting and manipulation of guilt, shame, tradition, obligation, and control. **I grew up in a household where if I didn't cut my nails then nail polish remover was jammed down my throat.** I grew up being fearful of expression and opinion. Especially as I got older and had grow and be an adult about my circumstances. My Grandma didn't want us to end up like my mom so she decided to toughen us up. **See the thing about my Mom is she is a Vagrant drug addict living on the streets.**

She still asks me for money when she sees me and its just depressing. I grew up in a dysfunctional home.

I get that we all have dysfunctions and that everyone has issues. **But I am sick of people devaluing my situation or circumstance telling me to suck it up. I did. I grew from it. I had terrible relationships. I've made plenty of mistakes. I know I am not perfect.**

I lived on my own and went to therapy and was in a psych ward multiple times. What I learned from mental hospitalization is that its a process, its not compassion, its a business, I felt like a cow on a conveyer-belt. Take your medication, write your inadequaces, talk about your deficiencies... **The thing is I want to feel worth it. I want to be more than I am. I always had dreams of being something better, something greater. In fact when I got kicked out of my home the first time I built my life up, became confident, charismatic, charming.**

**I felt in control of my life. I felt strong. Maybe it was my antidepressants finally kicking in. But I felt like a dreamer. I felt like I could share my opinions without fear or judgement. I felt like I could express and be treated intellectually and not like a mental head case.**

Regardless, I lost everything due to toxic failed relationships, terrible mistakes, and self destructive tendencies. I lost my job, crashed my car multiple times. I know I fucked up. I beat myself up everyday. And thats the thing...

My sister... We both grew up in the same environment. But we came out completely different. We lived in a home where traditional toxic mindsets have been ingrained into our subculture. My Sister was rebellious and aggresive. I was submissive and timid. We lived in a home where our grandparents raised us because our mother was a drug addict. I was raised in a house with mainly women. My sisters and grandma. Grandfather was always overseas due to work. And Toxic Masculinity was the go to. The man was expected to do everything. The man had to be strong. I wasn't allowed to cry. And I was beaten and abused harder than my sisters. Feeling guilty about what I do. Example being that if I try to be helpful at a friends I am a shithead for not helping at home. If I don't help then I am a shithead for not being a good guess. A lot of the time I just get put in these lose lose situations. And even my sister has come up to me and apologized to me for her aggressive manipulative, vindictive, behavior. See I am a pretty effeminate male. And I feel like I can't be myself. I have to be what society tells me. And I am always drained and lacking energy. The only way I can get around to work is to take my antidepressants to just function. Although I have constant anxiety attacks and have failed at home. 

My sister is diagnosed Bipolar. She likes to take out her frustrations on me and my younger sister. She is a Nihilist, she likes to enforce her opinions and is very vengeful and spiteful when people attack or treat her unfairly. Like my Grandfather she has a temper about a lot of things. Unlike my grandfather which I try to understand and respect because he comes from an older generation and although his views are no longer up to date it doesn't mean hes bad. My sister on the other hand guilted me 2 years for when my grandmother had cancer and I avoided her. But now that 5 years have passed since her death she talks about how terrible a parent she was and how she was bad for us and how she hurt me more than anyone else. See the whole reason I have this feeling of hopelessness and weakness is that my sister likes to push my buttons. Push my limit. Shes left me on the street after her BF broke my jaw. She has won my trust many time again where I felt like we could talk to eachother and have heart to hearts and she told me she understands why I am why I am and how she doesnt want to be mad about things that wont matter 5 years from not. She finally gave me the validation of letting me know she didnt think I was unintelligent. And like every other time and with family I let her in only for her to manipulate and tell me how I mooch off the family at home and I don't give any help to the family.

For the finaly bit of context I will explain why what she says bothers me and breaks me down to the point of suicide. See I failed a lot. I lost multiple jobs, and wrecked my car and have been in a lengthy yearly process of trying to repair myself. Fix myself. Think of myself as less than scum. **I spend so much time trying to convince myself that I am worth it. That I am not scum. That in a nihilistic philosophical sense we make our own lives and decide what to do with it. That even if life is supposively pointless that we are in it, we exist in it and we control it to an extent of what we want to do.** And its one thing to try and fix yourself. Its another when you don't have a support system. I like to be expressive. I like to like what I like whether its popular, unpopular, not a click, not a hipster because no one else does but just things I like. I take from everything i enjoy.**I wanted to be a Polymath.** A creative, I had good grades, was in advance learning, I used to write and draw, I used to do a lot of things. I had goals and dreams. **I wanted to do it all. Animation, film, music, dance, acting, modeling, special fx, cinematography, Martial arts, cosplay, fashion design, make music videos, just art.... Art, expression, creativity, making things that convey emotion and understanding, convey expression, create ideas and dreams, like how comic books have influenced science, or even films influencing with concepts and symbolism, how science fiction dictated science. At one point i felt like I could do it. I could do more. I felt like I was good at multitasking, that I was good at a lot of things.**

Now the whole multitasking was a false myth. How it decreases productivity and IQ. Now I see all the failures, all the mistakes. All my friends live far away either out of state or whatever. I've become this rushing recluse who has become socially awkward and scattered. **I am sure I am missing more context as well.**

See where I am at now. I lost my last job due to a mental breakdown at work and other sucidal tendencies. Feeling behind, and inadequate. I have a new job and I try to avoid going to work when I have meltdowns. I try to avoid my family and try to help then when I have money but I am just trying to get out of my own hole.

I do have a couple vices that I hold on to just for sanity and I know its not healthy but I feel like I am living on a limb. Before all this I was constantly fatigued as if I was a narcoleptic. I know a lot of it is because I have issues sleeping and overwhelmed with stress and stuff. I smoke pot a lot and have a legal medical card as it helps me with stress and eating. See... I don't know if its from the trauma or abuse or self neglect as I have terrible self care skills but I have IBS, Gastritis, and ulcers. I smoke because it helps me with creativity, it helps me eat and it helps relax me... My sister holds it over my head calling me the same druggie my mom is although shes asked me to smoke her out and she used to smoke as well. I take Cymbalta and its finally starting to give me the energy I need to function during the day although I am still behind at the marketing company I work at... (which is great I have a job and I am not shitting on it but its not exactly my cup of tea, I hate selling things I dont have interest in. I hate bullshitting people) I crave authenticity but feel ashamed of my lack of it due to conforming in a society that is based on clicks, and selective judgements, with egocentric biases, or group biases. See I don't belong anywhere. I tend to hang out with friends who are crazy out there, friends who are healthy, A lot of goth people I hang out wiht share my similar interests but I dont share the fuck the world mindset or the whole idea of fighting back aggresively.

My last personal vice that I haven't shared with anyone is that I have been microdosing Adderall to function at work and not fall asleep at work. I microdose smoking pot during my lunch break too... What scares me is that Adderall makes me feel confident and in control like I used to feel several years ago. And I know its not healthy to do that. And I know I am trying to take better care of myself. But its hard doing it alone. I know no one is going to do it for me either and I dont expect them to... I know my mother has had an addictive personality and I dont want to be a drug addict like her either. But these things help me.

**I am not expecting my family to change or the world to change for me. I am just a futurist that believes in human potential. I am surrounded by nihilists here and I am the only person in my vicinity that believes in success or existentialism or potential or a future. Although whenever I mention these things its cheesy or cliche, or stupid.**

**The thing is I am not trying to find a bunch of people who just agree to agree either. I just crave authenticity. I am an ENFP if anyone is into that stuff. Not like personality types are the full indicator of who you are and they aren't set in stone.**

I just want to preface this with the fact that I am sure I have typos, or things that aren't clear, or clumsy, or sloppy. Please don't bite my head off. Please don't evaluate it as me being crazy. I just miss things in the process of scrambling to think it all out or write it down without feeling like I am in a constant state of rush. I have all this fear killing me. It kills me at work feeling afraid like I am not wanted there or thought of as weak. And I know I shouldnt care what people think. Its just that I have been ostracized and awkward or outcasted when I have no one else to turn to especially when I do become emotional and unstable and push people away. I have had borderline symptoms and experiences. But that doesn't dictate who I am. I know I can be a lot and I try to stay reserved and polite. But some days I explode. and I am sorry for that. I just want people to look at my thoughts as thoughts and not irrational emotions or crazy ideas that no one respects. I get expressive an emotional not because I am just emotional but I have a lot to convey and express and there are things I don't understand that I try to interpret or frustrate me.

Regardless of what you take from this long winded post... My thing is. I am trying to build my life together. I am trying to be independent. I am trying to take care of myself and not feel weak and hopeless. But I feel compassion is gone and i am alone. Therapy and psychology I have gone and looked into but I have issues expressing all my issues to my medical therapist and psychologist. I told them that I smoked pot and they told me how terrible it was and to not do it. I have the lowest level of medical which is Medi-Cal here in Cali. Which I am grateful its free of course but without reliable transportation(i am saving up to fix my car) it makes it very difficult to do that. Let alone purchase and provide food for myself(i tend to not eat and tighten my belt until payday. I know a lot of it is regulating priorities and I am trying to be better at it but its difficult doing it alone. And I don't want to take help from my family without with fear of obligation or guilt that they will uses anything i have used as a resource against me. (especially food). I used to have food stamps but I no longer qualify at my current income (I have been spending my income paying debts back and trying to fix stuff. I just finished paying for my laptop.)

I think I have a lot of analysis paralysis that has built up after my past failures. And in no way am I saying that I am not at fault either. I just want help and I don't know how to get it without judgement, fear, lack of control, or compassion. I want to feel like I am wanted or not a waste of space. I know you need to love yourself first and I am trying but I look back and think it too late. I am 28 and I wasted my life being bed ridden due to depression for 3 years and now its happening again where I wasted my life with depression, lack of energy from lack of food and trying to stay in my corner of the world to avoid confrontation. **I am not a coward. I am just tired....** I just think my dreams are so outlandish and so unrealistic but for some reason i want to believe in them. Even if its illogical. I felt like I was talented. I felt like I was good at talking to people. But here I am now all by myself at work rushing through this message trying not to look more ridiculously irrational to my coworkers while trying not to get fired.

**TL;DR** Someone please help me get out of this. Help me find a way into a better life. I have no support system, my friends are all out of country or out of state, and all i feel is helpless and pathetic. I dont need someone to do everything for me. I just want to feel like i used to. I want to feel like I did before. Where I felt successful. Where i started as a packager at a design company because I had no experience and i learned the ins and outs of the company. Even in the company I am in now. Although I miss work a lot they depend on me so much and its probably why I havent been fired... I basically do a little bit of everything at the company from production to consultation to design and marketing. I just hate selling because its selling marketing for real estate agents. I just need a direction or some kind of support please. Otherwise I am going to kill myself because I don't know what to do anymore.

**Its not about dramaticism, or emotionalness. Its about tolerance and a limit that has been far surpassed.** Its about finding peace or an escape. I don't want to die because I want attention and don't know how to get it, I don't want to die to get back at someone, I don't want to die because life isn't fair. I feel like dying because I feel like there is no where safe to go. I don't feel safe at home. I don't feel safe at work. And I don't feel safe in a psych ward or anywhere else. My mental sanity is at its limit... Please."
"Why does it really matterHey I probably wonât really ever come back to this but I just want a place to put how I feel. I feel like I just am a waste of space with no point in life. I feel like I canât ever really make friends and everyone hates me. I try to be nice and be generous but that seems to just get people to take advantage of me. What difference does it all make it the first place itâs not like it really matters Iâm just gonna end up dead anyhow. If Iâm going to end up dead eventually and my life will have no impact, then what is even the point of living it at all. "

"I guess I donât even know where to begin or what to sayI feel like I have no future. Nothing worth breathing for. I felt like that for 10 or so years. And then a woman came into my life. And it was all ok, I had a purpose and it was her. For fucking years it was her and I nothing else mattered between us. Then I got her pregnant when she was 17 and I was 19, and I wanted to keep the child. She did too. But her mother who hates me wrenched her into an abortion. And I felt even hollower. I feel like itâs my fucking fault for not being there as a partner and father, like maybe I could have done something. I joined the navy after that and was soon kicked out for medical reasons. She was then ripped from my arms, and sent away for mental problems that were caused from the whole abortion situation. And I stayed alone working shit jobs. I lost the career I wanted my whole life. The woman I love is locked in an institution. I feel like a failure as a partner, a father, and as a provider. I developed a disgusting alcohol addiction, I canât go 12 hours without it. Everything feels like a mess. I constantly feel like Iâm having a heart attack, and when Iâm not awake and feeling that all I want to do is sleep, and when I wake up I drink myself to sleep. I have no idea whatâs going on with myself or what Iâm feeling anymore, Iâve tried to put an end to it several times but the god damn gun always just clicks, or I always just wake up the next morning alive and well. I just donât know, I donât know if this is a cry for help or just me bitching. I know people have it worse than me and it just makes me feel even worse because I feel this fucking hopeless and shitty. I just donât fucking know anymore.

"Missed 2 weeks of classes because of depression/suicidal thoughts - was just told I'm going to be suspended. What's the point?I had to switch my anxiety medication a few weeks ago and the new one I got put me at the lowest I've ever been. I was having constant panic attacks, I was depressed, and suicidal for the first time in my life. I almost ended it, but I talked to my doctor and scheduled multiple therapy visits, and 2 weeks later I'm doing a lot better. 

In this time I missed 2 of my classes 8 times and the other 2 classes 3 times. I managed to pull myself out of bed for some classes but the first few days I couldn't even get out of bed. My therapist told me to talk to the adviser on campus so I did. She told me today that since I'm now failing 2 classes because of my absences, and I was already on academic probation, that I'm going to be suspended. She said that since I still went to class some days I didn't qualify for medical withdrawal and that if I had broken my leg I could have had an excuse (her actual words). Not exactly something a former suicidal person wants to hear, that I should have hurt myself to get an excuse. 

Now I feel like a total loser, and hopeless. What do I do now? She told me I have to write a letter of ""what I will do better next time"" and wait for a committee to decide if I can come back, but even then I wont be eligible for financial aid anymore. This is community college and I can't even afford that.

I always think to myself âIâm not that suicidalâ


But everything feels like itâs becoming this massive big mess that I just donât have time to sort out. Everyone else seems to be sorted and I keep looking at myself and asking why I canât even just get these small things done that will make me feel better about the big things.
 

Every time I have a night like this, where I canât sleep because all those things I shouldâve done months ago are whirring around my brain I think âI can always die. If it gets worse, I could die.â And then, when Iâve decided I could die if I really canât anymore...I can sleep again.


Iâve had this thought since I was a teenager - when I was much much MUCH closer to what stereotypical suicidal is.  But itâs becoming a thought that repeats itself more and more frequently. Itâs not working like it has in the past, enough comfort, enough of a âplanâ that I could sleep off of the back of it.


And here I am, awake again, trying to use that fucked up thought to comfort my poor overwhelmed brain enough to sleep."

"still searching for options and methodsI turned 16 years old this year. I have been fantasizing about suicide ever since I was six years old.

I've been quietly reading almost every text on this subreddit for a while because it makes me feel less alone and diving into the worries of other people makes me forget for a while but lately I have just been extremely angry. I'm extremely close to dropping out of school and the knowledge that my time is limited is excruciating. I know I'm still young but it is probably more optimal to end it as fast as possible so I would affect far less people as if I were to further force myself to stay alive. I used to blame myself but now I am just angry at everyone else. I am so so sorry to everyone considering suicide, I am so sorry that this world has failed you to the point where you want to end your own life because your pain must be so awful and still unrecognized. I used to be so ashamed that I've not yet found a passion or that I am failing to contribute to society but now I realise society has failed me all along and it would be pointless to try and be a functioning member as I would just end up another meaningless part of a gigantic machine.

Finding quick options to finally kill myself has been difficult due to me being a minor with absolutely no money. Weapons and strong medication of any sort are off the list as I live in Germany. The mental health system here is still a fucking disaster and is basically just designed to force you to stay alive and ""functioning"". Funny how this place is supposed to be such an amazing utopia and yet everything is still built off of the exploitation of the less privileged.

"Not quite at risk, but felt like this could be a safe place to vent.I donât know where to begin or what exactly to say.

I would love nothing more than to die, but I donât quite have the guts to kill myself either. I think Iâve been depressed for a long time. I donât remember ever not wanting to be dead and it took me until recently to realize that thatâs not normal. 

Iâm addicted to pornography. That might be a joke to some of you, but itâs not to me. This brings a lot of guilt and shame into my life. I canât go more than a week without some form of pornography, and I donât know how to stop. Iâm also very religious, but donât feel like this is the place to talk about religion.

Iâve never had a boyfriend. Iâm young, 22, but I feel like a loser. Iâve never even come close to having companionship with the opposite sex. Never even held a guyâs hand. I wish that guyâs opinions didnât mean so much to me, but they do. I doubt anyone has even had a crush on me. It hurts to realize that youâre just not desirable. Any time I was ever told someone was interested in me it was a joke, and I canât even being to describe the way that hurts. Iâm not quite sure why Iâm so undesirable either. I know Iâm not a head turner, but I wouldnât call myself ugly either. Maybe guys are just intimidated by a girl who is 6â1ââ? 

I just started university. I should have graduated in the spring if I were a typical student, but I couldnât start until this fall semester. Half the people I went to high school with have graduated, and the other half will graduate within the next year. I feel so behind in life and Iâm not sure if Iâll ever catch up. I still live at home because I canât afford to move out and pay tuition. I have no friends my age around here. The friends I do have are away at their colleges. The only people I talk to are the moms in my neighborhood that I grew up around. I love those women, but itâs not exactly socially satisfying to only talk with women who are more than twice my age. Iâm lonelier than Iâve ever been in my life. When Iâm not at school, Iâm at home in my room. I donât even have a job because I was laid off and finding a new job makes me super anxious.

Thereâs one person that knows all about my struggles with pornography and suicidal thoughts. Sheâs told me to find a counselor, but I donât quite know how to find one and tell my mom that I need one. I donât want to disappoint anyone by telling them that I need mental help. I doubt a counselorâs ability to help me anyway. I struggle with anxiety too, and ever since I was little I ripped my hair out (trichotillomania). It sucks to think that Iâve had a brain thatâs never worked right. I told this person not to worry about me killing myself because my suicidal thoughts are passive rather than active. But Iâm worried about what would happen the second I start having active suicidal thoughts. Iâve held on this long without trying anything, but the way my life keeps slipping, Iâm not sure how much longer I can hold on. "

NASA is nearing completion of the Moon capable SLS rocket and Orion Spacecraft. Sierra Nevada is bring us a cargo version of the ""Dream Chaser"" with a crewed version to follow a few years later. Jeff Bezos just had a successful test of his new space tourism oriented rocket and capsule. China is building a rocket that capable of launch spacecraft to the Moon by 2030.

Just as ""Fly Me To The Moon"" became the unofficial anthem to the space race and the Apollo program will ""Levitating"" become the unofficial anthem to SpaceX and all the cool space stuff that will happen this decade?"

"What will the therapyst say?I'm in therapy for nearly 3 years. Been suicidal for twice as long. Had an attempt recently after which my therapist refused to work with me unless I made a promise. So now I'm obligated to call him if I decide I'm gonna kill myself.
I feel that I'll soon be ready to leave and I am afraid of calling. But I don't want to be a shitty person either.
What should I expect from the talk?"

"A Letter to SelfHi Self.

Things are looking pretty bad, huh?  Scratch that, they've been awful for a long time.  You already know that no one will help you out of this.  Friends may care for a short time.  Lovers care simply for their own pleasure, until they find someone else to get it from.  Family may care here and there, but they turn sour in the blink of an eye.  A doctor will care for 30 minutes during your appointment... maybe.  Everyone will judge you for any weakness you might have or show, and you can't avoid that.  You have no one else.

But you do have me.  I'm here and I will never abandon you.  I know how you feel.  All of it.  I know what eats at you and I know what you wish for.  I know your dreams.  I know how they look so far away.  I know how unloved you feel, how beaten down by life you feel.  I know the ugliness of humanity, how awful people are and how easily they can disregard others.  I don't want you to leave me or ignore me because I'm right here.

I'm here.  I'm here to help.  I'm here to give you strength.  I'm here to give you motivation and cheer for you.  I'm here to say, ""you can do this,"" even if everyone else tries to say you can't.  Because I know you can.  I've seen you do it many, many times.  Remember back when you were dedicated?  Nothing could stop you, at least not for long.  No obstacle or enemy could stand in the way between you and your goal.  Remember who you are.

Never forget what you can do.  You have been successful.  You have risen up from nothing before.  You've been homeless, going days without eating.  Yet you've clawed your way out of it.  You have had almost everyone you know turn against you.  Yet you've made new friends.  You've been completely betrayed by lovers.  Yet you've found new ones.  When you really look at it, nothing and no one has been able to finish you off.  You've had challenges that others do not face.  Each day you fight a battle no one will ever see.  You are strong.  If you weren't, you wouldn't be here right now.  Everyone has weaknesses, but remember that you have immense strength.  I've seen what you can overcome.  Never forget what you're capable of.

You can't give in to depression.  You can't make plans to kill yourself.  Every time you do, your life falls apart.  Things you've worked hard for come undone.  People don't help you when you're miserable, lonely, or suicidal.  They just don't.  No one will be sad.  They will just be angry.  People are selfish, and your suffering is an inconvenience to them.  They don't understand and will never understand.  You are easily forgotten.  You can't count on others.  Things will not work out, your plans will not work, and everything will get worse.  This happens every time.  You have to change this pattern.

I want you alive.  Maybe I'm the only one, but I will never change my mind on that.  I like you around, I like what you think and what you say.  I am always on your side, no matter what.  You make the world a better place.  I'd rather have you at your worst, at rock bottom, than any other person in history, at their absolute best.  You're really worth more.  You're needed.

You have nothing to prove.  It doesn't matter if you fail or fall or stumble.  It doesn't matter how silly you look.  I always have your back.  Others will never be happy with what you do.  Be alive for yourself.  Succeed in your own eyes.  The way the world measures success is completely hollow.  Ignore what others think.  Completely ignore them.  They flock when you are rich.  But they will not love and care for you when you are broke.  Live on your own terms.  Do this for yourself.

I'm with you.  I know what you're scared of, I know what you love, I know what you detest, I know your passions, I know your needs, I know what you hunger for.  I know your pain, your anger, your resentment, your hatred, your anxiety.  I know your happy moments, your smiles, your urge to help, your altruism, your good intentions, your desire to see a better world.  I know every single thing you feel deep down.  You don't have to hide anything from me.  You don't have to hide tears or desires.  With me, you can be totally free.

Remember your dreams.  I know what they are.  I know what you want.  You're not ready to give up on them.  They just look too far away.  You know you still want them.  I'm completely confident you can still reach them.  I'm here to help you.  I'm with you.  I will never give up.  It is you and me, together.  Let's reach your dreams together.  Let's claw our way out of this awful pit we're in.  Let's trudge through the muck of life and wade through this swamp of humanity.  We can shine.  We can be a bright star in the middle of all the darkness.  It doesn't matter how many times we slide backward.  We can climb higher and higher towards our goals.  We'll dig out of any avalanche.  We'll make it through any battle.    We can do it together.

Remember who you are.  Remember what you can do.  Don't choose the same paths that you know lead to failure.  Reach for your dreams.  Your real dreams, not the ones you think you're supposed to have.  Go for what you really want and don't quit.  Don't quit.  If you fall, I will carry you.  No matter how many times I have to, I will help you up again.  Through good and bad, I am always here for you.  Whenever you feel down, remember me.

Let's go get those dreams.

-Your soul"
"So here's the dealAbout a year ago my wife moved into her friends house because we were in a weird living situation where the owner of the house we were staying in constantly smoked. I understood. After that, she almost never saw me, despite her college was literally 2 minutes from where I was living. When we did hangout we had a great time, the last time was just this New Year's. She then moved to Indiana without even telling me. She is an immigrant from overseas and I helped her get her green card, paperwork finally went through back in August. After that she really just stopped even texting me. I know how it seems, used me for green card, I get it. I may report her for everything.

It's not just about her. I do not have any friends (in person, only online) and it gets pretty depressing. I try to make friends constantly but it seems that the people that do answer me online from around my area just like to hide behind their screens. I took a step back and tried to evaluate myself because maybe there is something wrong with me? The two major flaws I have is that I drink on weekends (almost always without anyone around so nobody would really know that), and I smoke cigarettes occasionally. I mean I have a good paying job, educated, fairly good looking and treat people well. I really don't get it. 

I did have a goal to teach English overseas. Multiple times I would make friends in the country I was wanting to go to, then when I mention this goal everything changes and seem to not want anything to do with me anymore. I can't figure out what is going on. Is this just what life is, because I am tired of feeling so damn alone every second of my life. I truly do not think I can take much more of this."

"I need someone to talk toI'm not sure what's happening. I'm currently on a comedown from drugs, but three years ago I was a very happy person who didn't smoke, rarely drinked, and enjoyed life. 

I'm so unsure with what to think. My girlfriend broke up with me a month ago, and after a pretty turbulent breakup (still talking, meeting) I decided to stop talking and I was happy with that and things felt better. 
I got into drugs a few weeks ago, not because of her, but because I'm easily persuaded. My life has gone down hill so much in the past few years. I have become so depressed and anxious. 
I'm currently laying in bed after staying out all night with people I hardly know, and now I'm feeling extremely paranoid and depressed. My thoughts are scattered. I can't currently see any friends in my life that would talk to me about my problems. I can see my life spiralling out of control. I need to talk to someone who will listen, because I'm usually the one who listens to people. 

I have no one. No one understands what I'm going through. I'm not sure I really want to do this life thing anymore. The way people talk to me, about me, about the way I am ; it's all building up and right now I believe I'm at the lowest point in my life, which will obviously keep getting worse. 

There's so much on my  mind, I'm losing my family , I'm losing weight, I'm becoming more angry, this is the worst feeling. Friends and family are going. And this isn't anything to do with drugs, this is literally my thoughts most evenings. So so so so much is going through my mind, I have no happy thoughts. It feels like I'm seeing things and situations for what they really are. I don't have all these feel-good chemicals in my brain to mask the mundane life that is reality. 

Like wtf is this life who the fuck would enjoy this shitty existence. "
"My friend has an eating disorder and I don't know how to help Hey, so my friend has an eating disorder and barely eats, and when they do, they try to throw it back up.

I've tried to help them by telling them the risks but they're obsessed with wanting to lose weight even though their body is at the limit and they won't listen to me. I've tried to convince them to get a therapist but they won't listen.

I've tried to contact their parents but their parents are absolute shit and don't give a shit about them. I'm genuinely worried about my friend and idk what to do. 

Do you have any tips/any ways to try and help me to help them?"

"it hurts so fucking muchPeople never take it seriously when someone says ""I'm insufferable"", but in my case, it's true. I have a horrible personality. I'm just autistic enough to come off as unaware and insensitive, but not enough to warrant any sympathy from anyone. I have horrible anger issues; when someone does something that hurts or inconveniences me, even if it was an accident, I get so mad at them that my mouth starts foaming. I haven't met anyone with misophonia and hyperaccusis as bad as mine; if someone makes a high-pitched sound within 100 feet of me, I start convulsing. My parents were emotionally abusive, so I have a pathological fear of getting yelled at or making other people angry. Like I said, I'm insufferable.

The only way I can feel safe and secure around other people is to lie to them, and I'm really good at it. I've made friends with people while I was pretending to be someone else, but the moment that they realize what I'm actually like, they either abandon me outright or start bullying me. 

At this point, I don't even want friends. I just want to live separately from other people, but I can't. I don't have the money to live on my own, I have to finish college, and I don't qualify for any kind of job where you never interact with anyone. I had to move back in with my parents and transfer to a commuter school because of how hard it is for me to get along with people. 

I just can't function in society. I just fucking can't, and no matter how many drugs I take or how many hours I spend in therapy, nothing changes. When I was a kid, everyone told me that things would get better for me when I got older, but they just keep getting worse.

I can't remember a time in my life when I wasn't suicidal, but it's never been this bad before. I have a shotgun in my room, and I really, *really* want to shoot myself with it. Even if I don't die, it'll still serve as self-harm, and, honestly, that's the only thing that ever calms me down. I don't even know why I'm posting this. There's nothing that could make my life any better. I've tried everything. There's no way out of this."
"Nowhere to go from hereI'm in my early 20s, unemployed for a couple years now. Can't get a job for the life of me. Only had crappy factory jobs anyway.

"I wish I could be convinced its worth it, but its notIt's not like I want to kill myself. I couldn't do that to my parents or brother, I know how much suicide affects family and friends and I could never do that. But, like if there was a car speeding towards me I know I wouldn't step away. If someone pointed a gun at me I wouldn't fucking argue. I smoke for the cancer and drink for the poison. Sometimes I push on my arm just to feel pain, pressing so hard onto the marks I make into my skin that I bleed. I don't like pain but I fucking deserve it. I don't deserve to exist happily and healthily in this fucking world. My life is meaningless because I am a human piece of garbage that isn't worth the fucking time of day. My friends pretend to like me, my parents are brainwashed into ""loving"" me. I have no future so why not just fucking die now, before I can disappoint the whole world even more??!!!! 

I know I'm only 17 but shouldn't I end it now before I have to fucking fail at life and school and love? Life is terrible and mine is hopeless and meaningless. People have tried to convince me otherwise but they don't know. I am in pain all the time, my mind hurts me. I am constantly miserable and tired and fucking sad. It sucks! I can't like like this anymore!!!!!"

"I told my family that I've considered suicide and now I feel like a fraudI've been going through a really rough patch and I've many times now considered suicide as a way out. This rough patch has also consisted of me being in a dull and shitty mood as well as abandoning social and school responsibilities. The thing that makes me feel even more guilty is how nice and understanding everyone in the family is. They noticed my mood change and wanted to help, but they kept helping in the wrong ways and eventually I broke down and told them I'm suicidal and can't get anything in my life straight right now.Suddenly everyone went into overly nice mode and I feel like a dick for making everyone worry and being extra nice to me when I wouldn't have the courage to kill myself anyway. I feel like such an asshole for making people worry and such a whining loser about getting all caught up and I feel like I threatened suicide about my tiny problems in comparison to everyone else suffering and suicidal. And this just makes me want to kill myself all the more for being such a burden in everyone's life and for being unable to deal with my minor issues when everyone else is having such a tough time."
"Got paid to be used for a night...Wall of text probably incoming. And still, no matter what I write, no one will understand -_-

I'm 23 and have struggled with depression for years prior to this, which is partially what put me in such a vulnerable position. Needless to say that I feel a large part of this depression has come from the fact that I've never been in an intimate relationship with a girl, to the point where I slowly just started giving up. I figure I just must not be good enough.

So Wednesday night one bad decision leads to another. Drugs are involved. I end up in a hotel room with a stranger, who's offered to pay me to just hangout and do more drugs with him. I'm uncomfortable right from the start, but am an addict of sorts and also desperate for money. Anyways -- I'm sure you see where this is going and I'd rather spare you most of the details, but I just have to get some of this off my chest.

He didn't actually fuck me but I feel like he might as well have -- afterwards i started feeling really violated and raped. he got much closer and touchier than i would have preferred -- and at the times, it was easy enough to just blank out and keep binging on drugs, but then i didn't sleep for days afterwards. I still don't really have a permanent place, because during that night i missed curfew and ended up getting kicked out of the shelter that i had been staying at :/

i just really don't know how i'm going to be able to go through each day from now on, knowing that. I got $60 for my efforts. fuck me right. i wanna just go jump off a bridge; or in front of a train; or swim out to sea; or overdose on heroin; or buy a gun

I've just been smoking weed and drinking beer and trying to calm down and chill out, but the money's almost gone and time's dragging by. And the only bed i have access too is in a 'gay dorm' where there are guys all around me fucking each other"
"Everybody hates me.I don't see the point in living when it's just constant hate and negativity directed towards me and it's only getting worse as time goes on, I am alone, nobody want's to help me because they hate me."
"It's gotten even worse.I posted here yesterday, but I feel like I didn't explain things very well at all. So, I'm starting back at the beginning. This will just be me rambling about a lot of different shit.


I'm a younger teenager. I've only told one person irl that I want to fucking die. Someone a few years older than me. I didn't even explain it well to him at all. He told me a bunch of shit that basically meant ""please don't."" And for about a week, I thought it fucking worked, and I was cured. That was SO FUCKING STUPID of me.

Before, my thoughts were everywhere and like I was going insane. Now, it's this weird sad calm of knowing that I'm eventually going to kill myself. And it's freaking me out. I hardly even bother doing anything productive because I know what I will do. 

Somehow through all of this, I've put up some kind of act or mask or something that has made everyone think I'm mostly fine, just tired. I will probably pretend that I'm fine until the day I kill myself. 

I will either steal a gun or hang myself. Or maybe I'll start researching ways to die with chemicals or some bs like that.

I haven't even told my fucking THERAPIST about this.  I don't think he'll ever find out. No one will find out.

I think that the sooner I do it, the better everyone else I know will be. I might as well be a fucking brick that my mom is buying stuff for. She might as well be throwing her money down the fucking drain.

I hate everything about me. I can't do anything. I am a  lazy POS. If I don't kill myself, I will just stay sad all the time, and not get a remotely good job, and die alone.

And the worst part is, a part of me doesn't want to die. Most of me does, but that  little part of me won't shut the fuck up.

But if I could just snap my fingers and die, I wouldn't be writing this. What the fucking hell is wrong with me.

Reading back through what I'm writing, I seem like a selfish self centered egotistical douchebag. I wish I had a gun next to me.

I'm borderline addicted to my phone. It's disgusting. I want to break it, but I feel like if I did something awful that I couldn't even imagine would happen. I have no idea why.

I can't even keep up with friends. I only have 2 friends and one of them doesn't seem like the kind of person that would want to talk about it at all. The other one is the one I mentioned in the beginning. 

Was it selfish of me to tell him that I wanted to die? He didn't have to be a part of my fucked up brain at all but I roped him into it. It would be even worse of me to tell him that it's worse. I don't like complaining to people, but especially not twice about the same thing, to the same person. That sounds pretty stupid considering I'm complaining to everyone reading this, but yeah.

Someone help me. Please."
"Not sure if the dreams are worse than how I feel when Iâm awake. Done with it all.Iâve never written a post before on Reddit, but I am so sick of living. Im 29, I have no job, no money, nobody left who I can really talk to, and I keep having dreams about my ex. I miss her more than anything, but she is happily with someone else now. We dated for 5+ years and I was a shit partner in the relationship. Only after we broke did it hit me that she was everything that mattered to me and I could have easily made the relationship work if I cared more then. Sheâs gone, and I canât get over her. Even when I try to move on, I end up having dreams about her that leave me waking up knowing that I lost everything that mattered. She is always so great in the dreams, even when she isnât. Sometimes she is even with her new partner, but I still find myself being friendly in hopes that she will come back to me. But these are more like nightmares when I wake up. Iâm left laying in bed with a sick feeling inside me all day, all week, all the time, I hate it. I hate living. Sure my family would be sad, and Iâd be seen as selfish for killing myself. So am I supposed to be the sad one and live like this just to keep them happy? I donât care anymore, i feel like a corpse already. My anxiety and depression keep me from applying for jobs and busying myself. I could go on and on, but then Iâd just be complaining too much. I just want to die and will likely make it that way soon."

"I really don't know how to title this.I've attempted suicide twice in my life. To this day I still think it would be easier to just end it. I know I should get help and probably be on meds. But the thought of telling anyone this in person just terrifies me. 

I can't even keep a job because a couple months in all I start to do is think of how I'm going to fudge things up and I just end up feeling physically sick. It's like I'm broken and can't be fixed.

My life is falling apart and I'm pretty much homeless. The thought of being on the streets again has been making me contemplate it even more. I have no control over my own life anymore and honestly I'm scared.

"Feel like I lost all potential and everything I cared aboutHey guys. I'll start off by saying that my situation really isn't that bad compared to others, I've just been feeling like I'm at a low point recently and I'm incredibly frustrated and need to get some things off my chest. This may just be screaming into the digital void or ranting but at least I can write my feelings down and maybe work through some things as I type.

I graduated college in May. While in college, I worked 30+ hours a week during the school year and 60+ hours a week in the summer to keep my student loans to a bare minimum. Always took the max number of credit hours so I could graduate early, was heavily involved in extracurricular activities, and had 4 internships over the course of my time in school so that I would have the opportunity to move out of my state and go somewhere new where I could at least pretend to make a new life for myself. 

I had 2 jobs offered to me in February and both ended up getting cancelled because of COVID. I graduated without a job and after months of applying for jobs in my field of studies and not getting a single interview,  I ended up taking a manual labor job in my home state in order to pay the bills and save up some money and have now been stuck here for 6 months. Not that there's anything wrong with manual labor jobs or the people employed in this field, but it's not intellectually challenging and I don't see any way for it to take me to places that I want to go or help me reach my goals. I guess I just feel overqualified to be in the position I'm in. I feel like I did pretty well for myself in school and had high expectations and hopes and every one of them has been cut down and all of the time I spent getting decent grades and working internships on top of my job on campus was for naught. 

Finally, I had been dating someone for the first time in a long time when March rolled around, but between the stress of COVID, losing out on two job offers, and now working a minimum of 55 hours a week, she left me over the summer because I couldn't find ways to be very positive about the situation,  never had much time to spend with her, and even when I did I was just too tired and forlorn to be interested in doing much. 

I don't know how to feel good about my situation and am afraid that all of the potential I had has been utterly destroyed and I don't see any way that this will change. Everything I was looking forward to and had worked my ass off for - moving away, starting a promising career, and having a significant other - have all been lost to me in a large part due to COVID. As winter approaches I have been experiencing a growing sense of dread and a lot of suicidal thoughts and emotions. I don't know what can be done nor do I think this post will change anything, but I just needed to talk about how hopeless I feel. I've got a roof over my head, clothes on my back, and food in my stomach, but I kinda just want to give up. If I'm going to work that hard for nothing then I can't imagine why I even bother continuing with anything."

"Been thinking a lot my own self worth and the ol temporary problem thing.I looked up the definition of the word temporary. All it said was, lasting only for a limited period of time and not permanent. So what is that? A week? A year? 17 years? So I thought about it some more and I decided that the word, at least for me, will mean until itâs gone. Until the feeling is gone. Then I thought about it again and I decided that youâd have to consider the scale of things. My grandmother is 92 and on a grand scale, thatâs also temporary. Life is temporary. 

Itâs been more than half my life now and it hasnât gone. This feeling, this..hurt. It stays. I donât know about anyone else but my self worth can only take so much when every other source tells me the opposite. âYou arenât worth itâ they say. Thereâs other stuff but at this point it doesnât really matter. 

Why is it a struggle? Why is it always a fight? 

Iâm not an athlete but Iâll use one for my comparison. There comes a point in every athletes life where at least ONE time, the brain has told the body to stay down. Boxers, right? At some point a boxer will get knocked down and the brain tells me body âdo NOT get back upâ and the count to 10 and done. 

That is where Iâm at. My brain is telling my body to stay down this time. Donât get back up. It is most likely a fear reaction of being knocked down again but that doesnât matter either. 

Iâve tried therapy, all sorts of drugs and none of them worked. What I needed, canât be bottled and therapy for the most part was unsuccessful. Either an attempt to convince me that what I needed wasnât really what I needed or just hey man, why donât you try moving to China and see what happens there. 

Iâve traveled. Iâve seen the world and tbh, it isnât that great. Changing my environment isnât where I derive my happiness though I am glad it works for some people. Iâve made and lost friends. Thatâs life right? People come and go. Iâm quite sure that if anyone reads this youâll remember it for a day, maybe and then forget about it. People come and go. 

So here we are. Many years later and still the same problem. Temporary? Sure. But all life is temporary. 

To anyone reading this, if youâre looking for help I really hope you find and get it. Life looks wonderful but it isnât for me. 

You win, bitch.

"When the hospitals aren't as packed I'll be throughAt least I hope so . Turning every single assignment late because I'm a miserable braindead piece of shit &amp; not even deadlines help at this point. I could be studying linguistics for free even if I didn't like it as much &amp; not be a financial leech on my family. I wish they didn't encourage me to go to these useless art classes that cost them money. It's 4 am and I should've handed the assignment this evening. Every single investment into me goes down the drain because I'm that worthless &amp; I keep getting lazier &amp; less capable of keeping up even with basic shit like household chores! I don't wanna be a burden to anyone anymore. I'll wait until the hospitals aren't as clogged. been suicidal for however many years &amp; seeing my peers in universities while I struggle with the simplest tasks &amp; the future (since I spent these years thinking i won't make it to 15-16) definitely doesn't help it.

19 is too old for me. I'm overdoing my stay, I shouldn't be there in the first place &amp; I know it. It's only gonna get worse"
Bird seed is great I love bird seed you can get so much of it for a reasonable price and it tastes good we should all eat bird seed
"Speaking my mindToday Iâve spoken to friends Iâve been distant with for nearly 4 months. It was a relief to know we were still mates and it sorta seemed liked they were happy I was there which I suppose is nice (the reason we were distant is because my anxiety and depression were really bad and I needed to try and focus on myself and that isnât the first time this has happened either). We had a laugh and it sorta felt like old times in a way but we have definitely grew apart which can only be expected when you go 3 months without talking to people who donât know what Iâm going through. Itâs not that I donât trust them with it, itâs just that Iâm too scared to speak my truth (to anyone). We spoke for about 2 hours and I forgot my problems for a while. I hope this is the start of us being a lot more close again and Iâll maybe be able to speak my truth to them. Over the last 3 months Iâve self harmed a lot and become obsessed with committing suicide but Iâve always had something to take my mind off it for a couple hours which is usually family who are normally always round which is nice as we always have a laugh and my 2 little cousins are always round and they canât get enough of me which can be annoying and thereâs days where I look after them for 7-8 hours which can be tiring but it takes my mind off it which is good I guess. I just canât imagine what being ânormalâ would be like after the last 2-3 years of mental health problems but I feel Iâm making small steps in the right direction despite the constant suicidal thoughts. 

Anyway sorry for rambling on but to you whoâs reading this I want you to know that you matter and I hope you can be able to live a happy life 

Cheers for reading I just needed to get my thoughts out one way or anotherðâ"
Just looking for a user named i_lodiWas helping someone with that name and just want to hopefully reconnect.
"A burden to othersJust lost another friend. Another person told me that I just stress them out since I'm constantly depressed and suicidal. That just goes to show how all I do is drag ppl down and how I'm a toxic person. 

Ppl would be better off with me dead."
"I DID IT!!!! I GOT THE HIGHEST SCORE POSSIBLE ON MY TEST! This Autism test was so easy, I didnât even study and I got the highest score possible!"
"Do nekos count as furries? Because, like, a neko is basically a human with animal-like features, such as a tail or ears, but, like, a furry is basically just an animal with human-like features, such as opposable thumbs, and the ability to walk, so I'm beginning to think they're one and the same and should be classified as such, so people don't get confused. I've just been kind of thinking about this all day and wanted some sensible people to end my debate."
"Nobody wants to hear what I'm really saying. I don't want help living, I want help dying.I do not want to live. I do not want to have deal with any more counsellors and drugs in the hopes of making me a productive citizen. I would like help dying and to have the people I care about respect and accept my will. Why is this so hard for people to understand."
"As a person who English speaks: I hate when people grammar use incorrectly? That ticks me really off. Like, English you should learn and know!!!"
How do I prove I donât have a perm So I have like really curly hair but I used to straighten my hair so everyone thinks I have a perm
"Just going to wait to the rest of my medication to wear off so I can do it.I missed my last doctors appointment because Iâm an idiot and slept in, and I donât want to go back and waste their time again because Iâve already missed an appointment and had to start the medicine again before. 

Last time I wasnât on any medication I was a day away from killing myself, and I know if I just wait a bit Iâll be able to do it. So, now Iâm just playing the waiting game. "
I'm removing paint off of metal. That's it.
"I will be alone for the rest of my life.I am 20. Never had sex, never had a GF. Never flirted and don't know how. Socially awkward. Horrible with conversations and small talk.
Most people like me end up killing themselves or living alone for the rest of their lives. Most people have had GF's, have flirted, had sex before me. They get to experience this while their young, which is why as adults it comes natural to them. All I want out of life is to have my dream job as a cop, settle down with someone, have kids, live a safe happy life . But all that is slowly being dashed away the more I think and realize things. My only real problem anymore really is that I don't have access to a gun."

Parent won't listen or treat me like i'm anything more than a little kid.  My parents still treat me like i'm ten .I've tried to talk to them about it but they ether act like im just tired of hungry or they pretty much ignore it. Also They never take me seriously or show me any respect. Is there anything I can do?
"Today will be the dayHello. I'm a woman  from  Brazil, I don't speak English fluently.
Here is a short resume from my life till now: my mother is narcissistic to the hell and genuinely hate me and thinks the whole world has something against or with 
her, if you know what a narcissistic mother is you know is bloody nightmares. I don't have a dad. She (And my grandmother) mistreated me all my life, one sentence I heard the most is: you're a burden. Ten years ago I suffered from intense self mutilation
, I just since then end all this bullshit. But life goes around... I tried my best. I did therapy, I get prescription for pills, try church and volunteer work.
I got a full scholarship in one of the best colleges here, I'm proud of it but I'm also a dropout (she never congratulated me but for sure remember how shit I'm for not accomplishing it). I get broke, we live together.
My grandmother passed away last month (the such disease I don't like to say it's name) and so life has becoming something else... It's painful. Not because I m sad about it but the whole process.
I felt for my aunt and cousin who I love desperately.  They two are the best people in the world. I feel sad for disappointing they.
I'm miserable. Numb. 

I take a medice and my mind is kinda blurry so probably don't expresses myself well. I reserved a hotel room for tonight, got some pills and think about a  wristcutter. Scary the hell out of me if it don't work. No one knows I'm about to do it and the place I'm it's not in lockdown. So today is the day."
Just a reminder [Of this POGGERS video](https://youtu.be/G-T3qKl6y-c)
"I know how strange this sounds, but fuck it; I just want someone to cuddle.I've spent my entire adolescence disconnected from my peers. I couldn't concentrate in class, so instead of combating that, the staff at my junior high just hovered over me as I did fuck all. I just want someone to hold, anyone.

I used to think I was solely attracted to women, now I don't know. 

I like the idea of having a boyfriend; a guy my age I can lay in bed with, it's a nice thought. 

I know I'm a weirdo. A lonely weirdo."
"So, I might turn into the Joker if I'm not careful This'll probably be lost in new, but I wanna share a story. I woke up today with a dry throat and parched lips. I should have drunk some water as soon as I rose from the bed, cause as I yawned, I felt a part of my lip split in two. I thought it was nothing until I started brushing my teeth and saw blood. And now I'm scared because I think that if I'm not careful, the entire left side might split and I'll turn into some sort of half joker."
