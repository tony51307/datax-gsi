"Iâve just got my first every celebrity Crushhh... Itâs Pam from the office...

(No spoilers Iâm only up to season 3)

_____________________________________________"
Why does everyone hate me?No one cares about me. Iâm all alone and I donât know where else to go. I just bother everybody. Itâs like the only time I do anything with someone else is when I basically force them to do something with me. I feel so clingy but Iâm just sad and I have to post here because I have no where else to go
"I overdosed on some pills last night and it's the best I've felt in so long.I have a horrible headache, I've felt nauseous all day, and I couldn't sleep at all last night. It felt like I was losing control of my throat muscles and I couldn't swallow anything for a little while. But you know what? I didn't spend last night or this morning depressed. I was thinking about the overwhelming pain I was feeling physically and not emotionally, and it was so nice. I didn't overdose to kill myself, I don't really know why I did it. But I'm glad I did it, because for one day(for most of it anyway) I didn't think about wanting to die.

Nothing makes sense to me anymore."

"I feel depressed because I'm scared my life will be boring I'm only 14, and I've heard people say to me that I should be having the time of my life at this age but I'm not. I'm suddenly extremely afraid and almost depressed thinking I don't make a difference, and that whatever I do, I'm still going to die and my whole life will just be gone. I have so much stress on me aswell and I feel like it isn't even worth it to live this long just to die anyways. I almost can't seem to think straight, like I try to see what's good in life, some things come up but it's like there's fog in front of them so they don't really mean much. I don't know if I want to die, I don't know if I am happy or sad. I have also experienced some weird coincidences making my stupid anxious brain think that I'm in a simulation or some shit like that."

Thanks in advance guys and girl!"
"ðµ Hold it now! Wait a minute ðµ Come on!

Just let me catch my breath

I've heard the promises

I've seen the mistakes

I've had my fair share of tough breaks

Need a new voice, a new law, a new way

Take the time, reevaluate

It's time to pick up the pieces

Go back to square one

I think it's time for a change"
"Got denied entry to local university, lost my job all beofre joon today. Been drinking for 2hrsI need some help. I havent told my wife but im sure she will be disappointed. Ive been a perpetual fuck up for years. I need to let her go and be happy. What now im so lost.

I actually thought my jrcollege grades were good enough. Im such a fucking idiot and failure. I need some good advice and soon. Thank you.

edit: my wife found me in the garage and called 911. it was a half-hearted attempt and they said id be ok. they said the alcohol is what put me out and not the CO. my wife is pretty shook up and i feel worse than i did before but for a different reason. she is usually pretty strong but this shook her badly and i cant do that again knowing how it would hurt her. im getting a saline drip for the alcohol i recommend it for anyone hungover =) ive had two councilers come by and a shrink. i really hate all this attention and exposure but whatever works i guess. they told me theyd have a poor nurse watching me sleep to make sure i didnt kill myself. =( this wasnt worth it. i need to reevaluate my life. thanks for the help guys.

"From the comments of a top post here..""I won't be the one to take my own life, either. Whenever I die, it will most likely be because something happened to me. My reasons for refusing to commit suicide are: 
1) too scared, 
2) do still genuinely enjoy some facets of life, and 
3) some kind of unbreakable force of strength guiding my life at the core that will not be silenced or squashed""

"Mixed feelingsI ordered what I need to kill myself a couple of weeks ago and it came today. I don't have a plan on when I'll do it, but having it here is definitely the closest I've come to being able to go through with it. It's somehow both comforting and uncomfortable at the same time. I researched methods thoroughly and this will be 100% effective if no one discovers me for at least five hours. That's very easy to accomplish. I'm just rambling now. Anyone relate?"
"Please just skip thisI feel like there is very little point to anything that I do. I'm always met with bad luck and failure, whilst others (people around me) simply breeze through life. I know that in my 30s I should have realised this a long time ago (and indeed, I did realise this since my late teens) but I just want to rant.

Let me see.

This year, my father died. My home suffered fire damage. And now I have to help out a relative who is going through cancer (financial and daily help). 

I hardly got work (I get paid by assignment). 

In the last few weeks, I had paid about USD 130,000 towards the medical expenses of the said relative. I really need jobs. I had some offers about 2 weeks ago. None of them materialised. Not one of them.

Meanwhile, my colleagues (whom I've known for about 10 years) continue to breeze through work and life, happily. They are one family (for a number of them, literally family members, with the boss being their father/father-in-law/uncle). They get their big projects, their big wins. 

The kinder/smarter ones amongst them have learnt to stay away from me. The mean ones still brag about their success to me, or claim that they have too much work.

I should point out, for a number of these junior members (as in, junior to me be it in age or seniority here), were 'tutored' by me in the past. I helped them when they started their careers. When they were too afraid to trouble their father/father-in-law/uncle with trivial questions.

Yet, they mock me now. They think that I am a failure because I am rubbish. 

To be frank, if anyone of them really wanted to help me, they can easily pass me some of their work. Not their big projects of course, but the tidbits. Yet they don't. They well know I'm struggling but no one even considered helping me. 

I note that I have become mean, at least in my thoughts, towards the said relative. Whenever I think that I would probably use up most if not all my savings, for this relative and also for my elderly mother, I just want to quit life.  To be honest, I think my death right now would benefit them more because I do have savings - I have been very very frugal in the last 10 years. But for my duty towards my mother, to see that I am around to help her with this situation, and to be around in her old age, I have nothing to stay alive for."
I need someone to be my friendI just lost $400 because I was scammed. I'm 14 I don't have any friends.  And my PC is the only time I really connect with people and talk to them.  So I want to talk to someone on here and see if that'll make me feel less lonely 
"I miss my mom so much...I lost my mom to cancer last summer and I miss her so much, I think about her all the time, everyday. She was my everything, all I had in this world and she was taken from me and now im left with nothing and noone. I want to see her, kiss her and hug her so much it makes me cry all the time. I want to go in Heaven to see her. I want to kill myself. I have nothing, no education and no job. I cant live like this and knowing Ill have to live like this for next 50, 60 years makes me want to kill myself even more. For my dad im nothing, he wouldnt even shed a tear after I'm gone. I want to go to Heaven to see my mom, its the only thing I want, can I see her if I kill myself? I did everything right in life and I know I can go to Heaven. My biggest fear is Ill never see my mom if I kill myself.. I never sinned, can I go to Heaven if I kill myself? "

"My fight with the spider So I was minding my own business wasting time as usual when this mysterious figure caught my eye. It was a spider, hanging from a single thread right next to me. Without thinking my arm moved on itâs own. It slammed the spider with full force right to the wall, where the spider gave their last breath. A life was taken that day, for the sake of my sanity. It felt good, but it still felt......wrong. Will I live on knowing I took an innocent life, find out on the next episode of nothing!

(Spoiler alert, I got bored but the spider thing actually happened rn)"
"5 days off my antidepressants and I'm feeling suicidal againSo, long story short, I was dumped, forced to leave the state I was accustomed to so I can live in Michigan where I have no friends or family. I found a new job, but without health insurance, and ran out of my antidepressant of 5 years. It's crazy just how much you don't realize an antidepressant is helping, until you no longer have it. Now I have to apply for health insurance, somehow find a new psychiatrist, and convince them that I've already tried literally all of the SSRI's out there and found that only Wellbutrin works. I have to do all of these things while extremely depressed and borderline suicidal. I've even been eating healthier and exercising multiple times a week, and I don't drink/do drugs. I've considered drinking just to get me by until my health insurance kicks in/I get my meds, but that seems extremely self-destructive.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is coming off as whiny, but I have literally nowhere else to go. I just wanted to express how frustrated I am that all of this is happening within a span of less than a week. Does anybody have any advice? I know the obvious ""be patient"" applies, but I've been hospitalized for a suicide attempt in the past, and have spent the past 5 years seeing a therapist and psychiatrist to keep my depression at bay. All of that was ripped away from me in an instant, and I feel so lost. Thanks for reading my rant, I hope I'm not judged too harshly for complaining..."

"How do I tell this to my therapist?I have a plan and I don't know if I can keep myself from committing to it on my own. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow. I rationally know I need to tell her. But because of my emotions I am avoiding anything and everything that could help me feel better or make me change my mind because I don't want to start doubting myself and I just want this (pain, life) to be over. How do I tell my therapist this? "
"I just wamted to thank all of youHello everyone, I just wanted to thank all of you.  From the age of 5-8 I was sexually assaulted by a female babysitter. In the end, her abuse caused internal lacerations, greatly affecting me physically and mentally.

I didn't have the courage to speak up until recently, and the rejection I recieved from my family after revealing,my secret was unbearable. I was told I should have enioyed it because I was a young male, by family members. They obviously have no understanding about child sexual abuse. It affected me in so many ways, it is so fucking sad, and I know children are still being abused, this really hurts me. 

This fall I was on the verge of killing myself, I didn'r tell family or friends that I was going to end it all. I planned to drive to a nearby major city and jump off of the highest parkade. I planned it for months, created my own will, and had money for my funeral, that is when Reddit stepped in.

I posted my story on Reddit, and a few kind souls suggested I go camping and gtfo of dodge, so I did.  During my adventure, I realized that none of this was my fault, and I can't blame others. That is what the weak and cowards do. I am moving on with my life, and recently enrolled in college. I am crying right now and would like to thank you all again. Dont let social stigmas define you, and speak up if you are a victim of sexual abuse, even if you are a male!!! THANK YOU REDDIT YOU SAVED MY LIFE"

"Not even sure if this is the correct subreddit.I'm not even sure if this is the correct subreddit to post this as I've never really said to myself, YES suicide is the option, suicide is the only way out I must fucking kill myself. I really don't know what replies I expect from random redditors if I do end up getting any at all but it just feels weird. I'm only 15 and I haven't felt genuine happiness in a long time. When I do it's always dependent on someone or something else that's never in my control. Sometimes i just want time to pass quicker, then I remember that after a few more years of studying I'll find a job, work that shit for a few more decades and probably just die, and that's if I'm being optimistic and I don't get hit by a car or die in some tragic accident. Everyone around me is starting to find hobbies that lead to a certain profession/job they enjoy. 

I on the other hand used to love to do a lot of things but have recently started loosing interest in pretty much everything. Even before, after some of the shittiest days of my life I could come back home and play some random game or talk to someone. Don't get me wrong, those games are still here and the people I could talk to still are but It doesn't seem to make me happy anymore. 

As I said - I don't really know what reply to expect, I know motivation won't help, atleast for more than 5 seconds. I will never kill myself - that's for sure - but I still don't know what to do."
"whatâs the point?my life is nothing. i am nothing. once i die, iâll be forgotten along with the billions of other people that have lived on this planet. whatâs the point in even trying? it feels like iâm on a roller coaster where iâll be ârecoveringâ for a couple of weeks and then crashing back down to the bottom where all i do is fantasize about slicing my arteries or jumping off of high bridges. my boyfriend is the only good thing i have, i donât even know why he still loves me. 

i wish i could just disappear, life is completely and utterly pointless."

"Iâm gonna kill myself soonI have no friends, Iâm failing pretty much every subject in school and I spend all day everyday just sitting around alone doing nothing because I donât enjoy doing anything, I got diagnosed with depression and social anxiety a while ago and Iâm taking medication for it but it doesnât help. I also have thoughts going through my head all the time that make me feel sick too my stomach. Iâm just waiting for the next time my whole family goes out so that I can hang myself while Iâm home alone. Iâve been miserable for a long time and my life is going nowhere, I feel guilty about doing this to my family but I think it will be better this way. "
"Is it moral to commit suicide if your loved ones want you gone?I have a panic disorder/agoraphobia, and it prevents me from doing a lot of things. I was blatantly told by my mother (whom I live with) that she canât handle me anymore. I donât blame her, I have no job and have issues just leaving my room. I want her to be able to live her life without having me as an obstacle, and she wants the same. She tells me often that she canât stand who Iâve become, and that she wishes she had someone else for a daughter. I think my brother would be hurt hardest by my death, but everyone else would get along okay.

Is it wrong to kill myself when I know some people will be hurt? Wouldnât it be just as wrong to live and hurt people too?

For the record, Iâve been in therapy and am on medication. I really want to change and be better, but I donât know how. Suicide genuinely seems like the only fix. "

"I am very depressed and have considered suicide. Can someone please help me to get out of this? (Read text)My life was OK when I was younger, except for the fact that my father was an alcoholic. I grew up with two siblings, one of which a half-brother. My father was a jerk most of the time, but worse when he was drunk. He would go after my half-brother a lot, because he wasn't related to my father. My half-brother moved out of the house when he finished high school because he couldn't take it anymore. They got into several fights before then. My other brother would also get into fights with my father. My mother couldn't stand him anymore. So when I was about 10-12, things started to go really crazy. My parents had a huge fight one night, and my father cut his arm with a knife deliberately to try to frame my mother (what a dick). This eventually led to a divorce. I finished sixth grade, which was a terrible year due to the divorce and bullying, and moved in with my father. I don't know why I chose to, I guess I was just stupid. My mother eventually moved to Pennsylvania to get farther away from my dad, and my dad moved to Baltimore. During school, I would visit my mother every other weekend which sucked major balls because my dad would always try to start fights with me by talking shit about my mother and half-brother. I had a lot of trouble fitting into the new school and I still do now. I'm currently 16 years old. I am afraid to talk to anyone in my school still. Also, my school is a majority black school so it's hard to fit in being white (I don't mean to offend any groups). I spend most of my time on the computer in my room or playing video games. I do have very few friends, but they hardly even talk to me anymore. I feel that I don't have any natural talents and won't amount to anything in the future. I don't know what career I want or what college I want to go to. I have never had a relationship in my life and that also affects my depression. Most kids at my age seem to be better off than me, by which I mean that they are either good at sports, have an artistic talent, etc. I have seen a therapist to help me with my depression, but that didn't really work. It now feels worse than ever. I just need help getting out of this depression and suicidal thoughts. I'm sorry about any bad grammar. I will answer any questions you have. I realize that my story may not be as depressing as others, but I still need help."
"my brother is allergic to pears he ate a pie thing with predominately pears in it two days ago and said it felt like there were toothbrushes rubbing on his throat, and his stomach started hurting as well. he had the bread from that pie again and felt no reaction. so now i'm just wondering ""why the FUCK would someone be allergic to PEARS of all things?"" so thats what i've got to say. i'm the ""brother can't eat pears guy"". and you know what? maybe i'm OK with that. it gives me a label, and labels are comforting. but i'm still confused why can't my brother eat pears."

"Any tips for a teenager growing out a bread for the first time? I have a beard growing and Iâm only 16 years old

"I'm an extrovert, and I have no more energyWe commonly say that extroverts need to be around people to recharge. However, it's not always easy to find people to recharge you. Maybe you don't have a lot of friends, and it's difficult for you to meet new people. Other times you may have a lot of friends but none of them can provide you the right type of recharge or validation.

I do have a lot of friends, but it's difficult for me to find validation because we're all so different. It's similar to feeling lonely at a party of people because you don't really fit in, or you can't find the qualities in people you need to make you feel like you belong. To make matters worse, I find the most effective forms of validation for me are through physical touch and quality time, something that's commonly associated with dating.

Recently, I've noticed patterns in my behavior that confirms my hypothesis. I've been intensely depressed for a month and a half now. Whenever I go on *quality* dates, my mood improves for a short time - sometimes a day, sometimes half a day. Eventually, it goes back down and the physical pain in my chest comes back in addition to the lack of motivation and energy. I've lost the ability to function. I can't eat, work, shower... I've lost 13 pounds in the last month. My body feels weak. It's giving up on me and I don't care enough to fix it. I'm ready to go.

Relying on external validation sucks, and it's not something I can control. No matter how many opportunities I give myself (dating apps, Reddit, social media), I can't force connections. I can't force people to want to hang out with me. In fact, it's come to the point where I've run out of new profiles on all the apps. It makes me feel really defeated. The more time passes without that validation, the more intense the pain, and ultimately the more I feel pushed to the edge."
"Jumping off a building in HoustonHey guys. So tomorrow I'm going to jump head first off the roof of the parking garage at Houston Methodist hospital. My thing is, this parking garage is only 100 feet high. I've read articles about people in Houston dying from it, but I'm afraid that it isn't tall enough to kill me. What do you guys think? I REALLY don't want to just be laying there on the ground, still alive and in mind-numbing pain. 

Also, I've made my mind up. For almost 2 years, I have struggled INSANELY with suicidal depression. Chronic suicidal ideation and Major Depressive Disorder. Schizoid Effective Disorder and Mania. 

I have been on every type of medication. Antidepressants. Antipsychotics. Antihistamines. Mood stabilizers. You name it. I've gone to therapy--individual therapy, group therapy, etc. 

There's just something in me that does NOT want to be alive. I HATE being alive. And I can't shake that feeling."
"Sometimes I feel like killing myself because I miss my dad so muchMy dad died 6 and a half years ago. He died in a VERY traumatic and unexpected way, on Thanksgiving. 

My dad and I had the most special bond. Words don't do it jurstice.

Is it still supposed to hurt this bad? 

Soon it will be 7 years and I still wake up screaming for him every night, because all I have are nightmares, and all I want is him.

I have a recurring dream that he wasn't actually all the way dead when he was buried. This is not grounded in any sort of reality, after what happened, he was clearly dead. 

What's the point of life when you realize that your whole universe could be shattered so, so easily. How do you go on when you've seen the person you love more than anything in a state that you only thought existed in horror rmovies?

I feel so wronged. WHy did they take him from me? Why did life have to influct his death on me and him in such a devestatingly cruel way? If some god or universal force needed to take him from me, why couldn't they have taken him peacefully. Why on Thanksgiving?

How is that fair?"
"Where to begin.A brief summary. 

I am an early twenties, Caucasian, male, living in a rented house with my partner and my 3 year old daughter and a 10 year old dog. I am unemployed, and am supposed to be 2 years into a 3 year university degree. I live in a first world nation and have no physical disabilities. 

I have a serious gambling problem. I have sought help, and am being lead towards cognitive behavioural therapy as a solution. I have spent approximately 8-10k of my own money and approximately 6-7k of my family's money. I have also just recently maxed out two low limit credit cards and cannot afford to pay my daughters nursery fees. I am seriously in debt. I haven't told anyone. 

In the autumn of 2014 I agreed to undertake a 3 year course to further my career prospects. In February of 2015 I stopped going and didn't tell anyone. I have no idea why. I was allowed to retake this first year of this course and started in September of last year. I haven't attended a single lecture. I am going to be asked to leave next week and have racked up approximately 30-40k of student loan debt. No one has any idea. 

I have applied for a job at a bank, if I get this things might turn around. If I don't, I have no idea what to do. 

There's more. I'm just struggling to compose all of my thoughts right now. 

I spend everyday waking up filled with sadness. Going to bed filled with sadness. I do almost nothing all day. I have no motivation. No appetite. No desire for anything. 

My partner resents me for some lies I told in the past. We do not have a loving relationship. She has a decent job and has made a good go of herself. I am very proud of her. 

I don't know if I want to be helped. So I don't know why I'm posting on here. I'm so very and completely lost. "
"I Hate Myself and Want to DieFuck man, let's see.. I just have had a pretty wild time for the past few weeks. Failed out of my dream school (because I haven't gone to a class in about a month), wasted 50k of my parents money and just am so miserable and angry at myself. I guess it's just venting but I feel that suicide would be like ripping off a band-aid. It would hurt my family and those close to me (not that close, don't worry) but in the long run I'll just continue to be a failure who hurts others. Why stay alive? Right now it's just fear of dying, and you shouldn't live just out of fear"

"If I was convinced it would end my torment I would have already done it.You guys wouldn't believe me if I told you so let's just go with schizophrenia.  
So I'm schizophrenic and I can't take the voices and especially the visions anymore.  
It never stops.  Sometimes it seems like it's getting better, like I'm my old self again but it's always so brief and then it's right back to hell.  
That's where I am.  I'm in hell... or like... a waking nightmare.  
I drank tonight after a year of sobriety.  It's not really helping but it sort of numbs the emotional impact.  
I went to the local Shambhala meditation center in hopes that I'd find some... something.  The instruction was good... but I kept hearing things like,  
""He's creepy!""  
""We don't want you here.""  
""You don't fit in.""  
""I don't like the way he keeps staring at everyone.""  
etc.

Before you even say anything, no I am NOT going to go on meds for this.  Fuck that noise.  I've seen what that shit does to people and I myself have never had a good experience with psych meds.  Never.  I went through 3 months of awfulness withdrawing from Clonopin, I'm allergic to prozac... just no, it's off the table.  
So where does that leave me?  I can't do this.  
A good twenty mg of Clonopin and I could just go to sleep and never wake up.  
  
EDIT:  And they recently found a ""mammary growth"" on my dog.  My best and only friend.  Going to find out if it's benign on the 4th.  I can't believe I left that out, fuck I'm selfish.  But if I lose her I'll have nothing."

I just feel so incredibly depressed right now. I'm not motivated to do anything. Everyone is pressuring me to get a job and go to meetings, and I'm just too depressed to do any of that. I really do want to kill myself. I was going to prostitute myself to make money, and then it just dawned on me how fucked up my life is. I just want to die. I don't think I can ever recover from this. "
"girlfriend having serious suicidal thoughts (sorry if this is the wrong place for advice from someone who doesnât have suicidal thoughts)iâm 15(m) and my gf (15) has been having suicidal thoughts the past year. we started dating this year so i havenât known her for so long since i just moved to this district. iâve asked a couple of her friends and theyâve said sheâs self-harmed twice and has had these thoughts from the SECOND GRADE. i havenât been able to sleep thÄ past couple of nights and me and our friends have tried convincing her that committing wonât solve any of her problems. she does have serious depression from dating a guy who then dumped her five days later for thÄ âschool sl*tâ. this broke her. according to her friend she cried for days and was extremely quiet Ã­Å class. eventually she got over him and started to develop a love for someone else. but he never liked her back or even paid attention to her. and on top of all this, she has no living grandparents and her parents are constantly arguing and have mentioned divorce. they are very hard on her since she sings, dances, and plays an instrument. eventually when i moved to thÄ district Ã­Å thÄ beginning of thÄ school year, we started to talk a lot since we were Ã­Å some classes together and i eventually got a bit of a crush on her. my friend subtly told me she likes me as well by screaming it Ã­Å thÄ hallways. she says that being with me has made her happier than before since iâm thÄ one person who genuinely loves her. a couple days ago her mother found out about us dating and told her to break up with me. she eventually told me that she wonât do it but thÄ stress broke her even more and she left for two days on âk imma go kms nowâ.  she came back and said her mom stopped her and that they went to a therapist. i never got an update on how that went. my friends and i are running out of ideas and iâve decided to turn to reddit. please help me."
"I have no phone or transportation. Tonight is not going well. I need company.I am in Columbus, Ohio. I have no phone or transportation. I am at odds with the people who own the place I am staying. The only thing that has stopped me from killing myself over the last ~year has been the trouble of dealing with my belongings/debts/responsibilities for my loved ones. But I have lost care for that. Tomorrow will be bad. What do I do."

"Taking steps to incite a mob to beat me to death.I need to die in the worst way possible.  I believe in consequences and punishment.  I'm too much of a coward to do it myself, so I need someone else to do it for me.

A few weeks ago I was transported to a psych ward by police for the first time in my life.  I've been developing and practicing a new habit of trying to manipulate strangers into believing that I'm a monster who deserves to die.

My attempts over the past few weeks have been unsuccessful.  People just look at me like a lunatic.  I tried handing people $30 asking if they'd see if they could take me out in one sucker punch for the free money.  Nobody complied because I did it in a well-to-do town.

I know my next step.  I know where I need to go.  I know the type of people who will deal with me.  And I'm getting better at acting.  I'm discovering a talent for it.

I must get beaten or burned to death by a mob, or at least a few VERY ANGRY people.  It's not fair that it hasn't happened to me yet.  It needs to happen.

I'm a disgusting coward of the highest degree.  Someone who is plotting to get killed by an innocent person.  It's time to face my consequences.

I'm getting help.  I'm getting intensive therapy.  I've been to the ER.  The mental health bills are starting to pile up.  I'm going to lose my job soon as a result of all this anxiety.  It's time to die."

I don't want to do it anymore. I struggle to get up, go to work, go to school, eat, sleep, repeat. I don't feel anything but guilt for being alive and for being jealous of people for things they can't help. I can't talk to my friends about my problems because they'll just get tired of how repetitive they are and how burdensome I am, so I lamely rant on the internet which is embarrassing and sad. I'm fucking pathetic really, and a waste of space. I genuinely deserve to die for being such a shitty excuse for a human being. "
"Not quite at risk, but felt like this could be a safe place to vent.I donât know where to begin or what exactly to say.

I would love nothing more than to die, but I donât quite have the guts to kill myself either. I think Iâve been depressed for a long time. I donât remember ever not wanting to be dead and it took me until recently to realize that thatâs not normal. 

Iâm addicted to pornography. That might be a joke to some of you, but itâs not to me. This brings a lot of guilt and shame into my life. I canât go more than a week without some form of pornography, and I donât know how to stop. Iâm also very religious, but donât feel like this is the place to talk about religion.

Iâve never had a boyfriend. Iâm young, 22, but I feel like a loser. Iâve never even come close to having companionship with the opposite sex. Never even held a guyâs hand. I wish that guyâs opinions didnât mean so much to me, but they do. I doubt anyone has even had a crush on me. It hurts to realize that youâre just not desirable. Any time I was ever told someone was interested in me it was a joke, and I canât even being to describe the way that hurts. Iâm not quite sure why Iâm so undesirable either. I know Iâm not a head turner, but I wouldnât call myself ugly either. Maybe guys are just intimidated by a girl who is 6â1ââ? 

I just started university. I should have graduated in the spring if I were a typical student, but I couldnât start until this fall semester. Half the people I went to high school with have graduated, and the other half will graduate within the next year. I feel so behind in life and Iâm not sure if Iâll ever catch up. I still live at home because I canât afford to move out and pay tuition. I have no friends my age around here. The friends I do have are away at their colleges. The only people I talk to are the moms in my neighborhood that I grew up around. I love those women, but itâs not exactly socially satisfying to only talk with women who are more than twice my age. Iâm lonelier than Iâve ever been in my life. When Iâm not at school, Iâm at home in my room. I donât even have a job because I was laid off and finding a new job makes me super anxious.

Thereâs one person that knows all about my struggles with pornography and suicidal thoughts. Sheâs told me to find a counselor, but I donât quite know how to find one and tell my mom that I need one. I donât want to disappoint anyone by telling them that I need mental help. I doubt a counselorâs ability to help me anyway. I struggle with anxiety too, and ever since I was little I ripped my hair out (trichotillomania). It sucks to think that Iâve had a brain thatâs never worked right. I told this person not to worry about me killing myself because my suicidal thoughts are passive rather than active. But Iâm worried about what would happen the second I start having active suicidal thoughts. Iâve held on this long without trying anything, but the way my life keeps slipping, Iâm not sure how much longer I can hold on. "

"It feels like my mind wants to fly out from this bodyToo many things are wrong and Iâve tried too hard to make them better. And now I just want to leave. I know there must be a better place out there but I wonder why I and others have to suffer here... itâs not fair. 
I have problems inside my head I think, and then problems outside my head and all I can really conclude here is maybe Iâm too lazy to fix them or maybe they were never meant to be fixed? Iâm just so overwhelmed with everything and I just hate being an adult (Iâm 22). 

Iâm supposed to be figuring out college, how to get insurance because I canât be on either of my parents, how to save money. Iâm trying to figure out whatâs wrong with and why I think certain ways, get angry or upset or think thereâs signs directed to me or whatever. Iâm trying to figure out how to have energy to do anything at all. I work and after I work I canât do anything else. I always think I deserve a day off but I donât. I take 4 classes; it was 5 but I dropped out of one. And I am 3 weeks behind on all my homework. I donât even know where the time goes I guess I just sleep I really donât know. 

I only work 3 days a week which is a little under $200 paycheck and my friend who doesnt go to school makes me feel like shit and always asks me to go places and I just donât know what is wrong with her as to why they donât understand why I have no money. My dad has no money so Iâve had a lot of things that I needed to pay. My mom is retired and I donât ask her for money anyways because I genuinely feel no connection with her and it is the worst feeling in the world. 

People just donât like me either. I donât know what I do wrong I know I am awkward but Iâve never been mean.. I donât know. I just kind of mind my business most of the time and I canât fake being someone Iâm not... and so I just donât talk to that many people I guess. Everyone else seems to always have people interested in them just meeting them for the first time and with me... no one looks twice, no one cares.


Long story short; in every way possible I feel I donât fit in here. In every aspect. I feel like the time is coming closer to call it quits and the days move too fast"

"My mom told me to ""just die""Im struggling this morning, couldnt look in the mirror

I'm 17, having trouble attending school

Spoke with my mom about what I should do (go vs stay home) and she was frustrated with me in what felt like seconds. We avoid all talk of depression or mental health with her because it irritates her, so in times like these we get nowhere.

But I also don't have anyone else.

I told her that I just wanted to disappear and she snapped and said, ""okay then, just die!"" I don't think she meant it but it felt like being stabbed. It's been 15 minutes and she left the house, took my car, I'm alone with my dad (not safe). I texted my friends and no one can pick me up. This doubt is creeping up on me and I want to go get the cyclobenzaprine and xanax in my medicine cabinet and chase it with vodka, or the knife sitting five feet away and slice open my thighs. I want to. I want to. If I kick out the screen I can get through the window, but there's nowhere for me to go. I need to disappear."

"I need some help pleaseI am miserable, and i want to die. Ive been molested all my life up until the age of 12 by 4 different people, two of those people being my uncle and my sister. Im 16 turning 17. I despise my parents. I have two jobs (tutoring), but after june 23 i am going to work elsewhere, and i currently maintain a 93 gpa. That however is not enough for my parents. My sister and I would fight all the time. Her being 6 years older then me. When i was twelve she broke 4 of my teeth when she was punching me, causing infection and cavities because my parents didnt take me to a dentist until two weeks after. I have 5 root canals done thanks to obamacare, but my teeth hurt so much everyday, sometimes the pain is unbearable even with motrin or tylenol. After my moms dad died back in 2010, it has all gone to shit. She is batshit crazy, emotionally manipulative, and extremely selfish. She has always been but hid it well. I told her once when I was 8 years old about what my sister did to me, i drew a picture and wrote as best as i could because i was too embarrassed to say anything, she just laughed at me. That really fucked me up. I was confused as to why she didnt want to help. I wanted to kill myself when i was 8. My mom is extremely religious and thought i was the devil. I hated church. I was an accidental baby and i know for a fact i am not loved. My parents are middle class and they have a good amount of money, but only spend it on themselves and my sisters college. I felt so ugly wearing my sisters hand me downs, i just want nice things and although im not materialistic i just dont want to look like shit. I got a scholarship to my school and everyone there is rich. I dont fit in. Ive done disgusting things for money but thats the only way i can buy my own clothes, necessities, and books for school. I make about 80 dollars a week tutoring which mostly goes to drugs. My parents dont let me leave the house and they complain that all i do is sleep.i go out once a month and dont come home until 6am. My parents resent me for this and make me feel like shit and then my mom bitches about how much money she put in raising me and she just wants me to have a good life. Fuck that selfish bitch. I thank God school is over so i dont have to be locked in my bathroom sized room studying 3 hours a day. I recently found out my father masturbates to me and i just feel so weird. My dad is never home. All my boyfriends have have been controlling. I felt so heartbroken when my alcoholic ex boyfriend (the only person ive ever loved romantically) got a bitch pregnant. Fucking alcoholics. Anyways, i have nothing left to live for except drugs and although the cutting is soothing its not enough to end the pain. I am thinking of killing myself after my sister leaves for summer break because although she has done that to me, we grew up and she is like mother to me now. Isnt that twisted? I like to beliece that in my past life i was a huge bitch or something because i dont understand why so much bad happens. Why cant my parents just let me live. What is the point if im miserable. I myself am far from perfect. I feel terrible for using my boyfriends to get what i want. I have no one to talk to for my best friend got sent away to military camp. Sorry for the horrible grammar and formatting, i am using my sisters shitty phone. Thanks for taking your time to read, i never opened up to anyone before."

"I WANNA DIE EVERYDAYI can't even encourage my friends who tell me randomly that they wanna die not to do it or listen to them. I just tell them that we should do it together. This has been years of battle but makes things easier as well because whenever I think something fails in my life, I can just die. I am also not afraid of death. Thinking of writing my will as well and giving my savings to my bro tho it's very small. At this point nothing can help me tbh, all I see is the world is doomed one way or another. Just waiting for a trigger to finally do it lol."
"SL #5i'm exhausted, 

i'm tired, 

i'm 99% done with life,

i'm done trying, 

its my life,

i'm the author, 

i choose when to end it and how to end it.

i'm tired of living for my family or friends. 

i keep telling myself that it will get better in time, i keep telling myself that this is just part of life or that i will soon be happy. but i'm not happy and i never will be. I can try and get help but it wont do anything, it wont work. why is the world so judgmental. why cant we live our own lives without fear of shame and embarrassment. why do we shove our beliefs down each other throats. if you don't agree then you don't. at the end of the day were all humans. regardless of wither or not you believe that God is real or Zeus is real. It doesn't matter because on this earth, all we have is each other. why cant we learn to love. i'm not telling you to accept or conform to others but just remain respectful. when were kids, we don't see race, or gender, or sexuality or politics. all we see is each other and how we love to play tag together. so why is that when we get older, negativity just takes over. you wont realize how much you needed me till i'm gone. i'm not saying that to sound stuck up. i'm saying that because i loved you all. i saw past your flaws and past your negative energy. but you didn't do the same. you pointed out my flaws. you made them seem like it was the end of the world. you told me that i was worthless. you told me that if i didn't change, know one would love me. you made fun of my mental health. you knew. you saw the signs. you read my hints. but you chose to focus on yourself and ignore me. you played the victim while I tried to help you. maybe that was my fault. i loved and loved everyone but i could never learn to love myself. I thought i could be the one to make a difference in the world. silly me. i only soon realized that they were called fairy tales because they never come true. wishes don't come true. your born into this world for a specific reason, to carry out a certain task. sometimes that task is to be an example. i'm an example. i'm an example of someone who loved too much but could never learn to love himself. I was happy once upon a time. but the weight of the world was too much for me to carry. after all, i had already been carrying everyone's problems on top of mine.  maybe i should have been more vocal about my problems. maybe i should have reached out. but as family and or friends, are you telling me you never noticed? you never saw my texts? you never listened to my music? did you never see my sleepless eyes? my slit wrists? my tears on my pillow? are you saying that you never knew? that's a lie. you knew, you just chose to not to do anything. why? were you afraid. were you scared that you would have done more harm? you wouldn't have, have you just told me that you love me. that would have made me look at life in a whole new set of eyes, had you told me that you see my struggles. that i'm going to be okay, that you'll always be there for me. i wanna cry, i want to just hold on to something, i'm tired, this sadness is like a bug who wont leave you alone on a hot sunny day, i want to get better, i really do. but i cant. you wont let me, i wont let myself, I've written so many suicide notes and each day i tell myself that today will be my last day. its not. i cant. i cant seem to bring myself to end it."

"What to do when you need to fill a prescription for actionable love and it's always out of stock?I have multiple invisible physical and mental illnesses and disorders that I have been diagnosed with by medical professionals and have had the majority of my life since I was a toddler. I'm currently 27. My entire family has various conditions as well. I wrote out a suicide note for the first time yesterday despite having experienced suicidal ideation very frequently. I told myself it was for the hopeful catharsis. I've reached a point where I feel like I cannot lie to myself anymore. I do not have health insurance. I do not have access to resources. I cannot work or attend school because of my challenges and am fully 100% financially dependent on my parents. 

Everyone in my family has specifically expressed that I am crazy, lying or lazy or all of the above. 

What do you do when talking to anyone does not help because what you need are words that accompany actions from those you love that you will never receive even after directly behind for them? I hold out every day hoping that they're wrong. That I'm wrong and I don't know how much more hope I can muster. I feel like I've used up my time. Comorbidity is a bitch. I reach out and come down the mountain with these big blocks of text ""I'm fucking sad and want to die,"" but there is no release. At the end of it - every single one of my problems is still staring me in the face and it's just circular. I have zero confidence in myself. I hate myself. I hate who I am. I have never felt loved unconditionally except by my pets. I have never been in a relationship where I didn't feel like I was their secret because I either wasn't good enough to be their partner or they were embarrassed of me. I'm not not the kind of person to put a bandaid on what feels like the titanic. I hate to waste time and I feel like an ultimate waste of space.

Bipolar I with near constant psychotic features despite what kind of episode I'm in. OCPD. CPTSD. OCD. Panic Disorder. Anorexia. Agoraphobia. JRA. 8 major and minor concussions. Severe insomnia. Various other symptoms and problems that have become worse since losing access to health insurance which includes frequent fainting/falling, sudden racing heartbeat and vertigo. These could be linked to the JRA, but since I have not been able to get to a rheumatologist since they became an issue - I don't know. All these things together make me feel like I've got every card stacked against me there's a big ass deck that can always be drawn from the keep me down. All of this makes me feel very alone. Very, very alone and unloved. I don't think there is any more I can do. I honestly don't even know what I hope to get from reaching out here on Reddit. I'm a lurker. I say words don't do shit for me anymore and yet here's my own to match Ninety-five Theses."

"I tried and failed, but gunna try again.Hi all, I recently tried to kill myself by hanging.  I posted this earlier on r/AMA but i got a lot of negative feedback, hopefully the people here are a touch more compassionate.  By a complete fluke, my neighbour walked in about 30 seconds after id stepped off my stool to return a popcorn bowl.  Id been planning this for about a year, and i think im going to give it another go at the end of the month, and make sure my door's locked this time.  


I'm not irrational, i dont try and kill myself out of some emotional outburst, and its not a spur of the moment decision.  My life is actually quite good, I've got a good job as a concept artist, i own my own condo, I've got lots of good friends.

I was quite badly neglected as a child.  My therapist told me i have a form of low grade background depression; its just always there, like an itch you can't scratch.  It feels like being stuck at an airport with nowhere to go, just always in transit, never quite at home.    


Ive never had much luck in relationships.  Im quite handsome, im fun to be around.  Im compassionate and I invest in the people im close to, yet it seems the women i meet are more interested in using me to boost their self esteem and move on after 2 weeks.  I dont know how many times ive gotten something along the lines of ""youve given me the self confidance i need to move on and find what im really looking for.""

I've accepted that life can be brutal and unfair, that people can be unbelieveably selfish, and you have to be a boarderline sociopath to make it in this world.  Its just that, im not built that way, so there's really not a place for me here.  So i'm leaving.  


Thank you to anyone who's got some advice for dealing with something similar, however if I can't figure this out in the next month I'd really like to see what's waiting for me on the other side"

"I don't want my life anymore.Like I wish I could just transfer my years of life to someone who would do something with it instead of me. I've waisted my life. My ex used to scream in my face how I am nothing and I've done nothing with my life but I honestly was at least trying before him. He hurt me in so many ways and then just became a tinder patrolling fuck boy after we broke up. His birthday was this week and coupled with Valentine's Day I am really struggling with loneliness and depression. 
I want to go on his page and see all of our mutual friends who wished him happy birthday so I can delete them out of my life forever. If they don't want to believe he abused me I don't want them to be a part of my life. But I have been able to refrain from letting my pain act out in any way. I haven't had a steady job in years and barely get enough freelance to survive. It destroys my self esteem worse than he or my parents did, and that's saying a lot. I used to really be confident and like myself but now I just find everything and everyone so exhausting and overwhelming that I just wish I could die. I think about it a lot. I already tried to poison myself last year when he was telling me I was telling me I was disgusting and a whore and meeting up with outer girls and lying to me about it. I feel isolated after learning that he and my parents are narcissistic abusers and I have no one. "

"I don't know what to dojust brief background. I'm 18 and a freshman in college. I've been dealing with social anxiety and depression for a while now. It was really bad in high school, but ever since starting college, it's gotten a lot better, and I feel like I've been making friends and I've gotten to know a lot of great people.

But even though things had been going well, I feel like they're getting worse again. The first month of school I was doing so much shit, going to parties, going to club meetings, meeting new people, etc. But that has kind of stopped recently. Which by itself is fine, since like I said, I might not be doing a ton of shit and meeting a lot of new people, but I've consolidated a nice, tight group of friends.

But even though things have been going well, there is still something I lack in life, a romantic relationship with someone. In high school I had no success whatsoever, for a variety of reasons, to the point that I was kind of resigned to the fact that I would probably live and die without being in a relationship with anyone. And as pathetic as it seems, I was really OK with that, especially since I had gotten so used to it. Over the summer before college, I was way more concerned with trying to make friends. And that's part of the reason that I was so happy the first month of school. Because that's what I got. I was meeting new people, becoming friends with people... for the first time in my life I felt like people didn't view me as someone awkward, as someone lesser. People actually wanted to be friends with me, probably in large part due to the fact that everyone was a freshman and desperate to meet new people.

But then for maybe the first time in my life, I started having feelings for other people. I guess part of the reason I never really had a crush on anyone in highschool was that I was never really good friends with many people, and for me, anyway, I feel like I need to know someone well before I start to feel anything for them. So anyway, there was this guy I met who I knew was bi, and I asked him if he wanted to do anything sometime, but he told me that he was still uncomfortable with his sexuality, so he didn't want to do anything. Alright. no problem with that. I was a little dissapointed I guess, but I got over it.

But then I met this girl in one of my classes. It was during one of the first days, so no one really knew anyone else, so I just sat next to her and started talking. I had literally no interest in her at that point, I was just trying to make friends. And it went pretty well, and we started talking more and more, and we did some stuff after class a few times (like study for tests, get lunch, that kind of stuff) and I started to really like her. So I asked her if she wanted to hang out a few times, but she was unable to because she was busy over the weekends, which kind of bummed me out, but then a few days ago after class we got lunch together, and she was talking about how much she liked art, and I invited her back to my dorm to show her some of my drawings.

And from there... I don't really want to get into specifics, but I kind of fucked up. And I feel like if I was more confident or had more experience at this kind of thing I could have had a chance with her. But I was just so awkward and inexperienced I didn't know really what to do. I think we're still amicable, but I definitely don't have any shot of getting with her in the future, I guess.

And this has really been fucking with me for the past few days. But it's not really about losing a chance with her. Because I like her and all, but that's at least something I can get over pretty quickly. It's the fact that I feel like I'll never find anyone. I feel like I'll always be too awkward and depressed to actually have any kind of relationship. I don't give a shit about sex or physical intimacy. I just want to feel like someone cares about me. Especially after being spat on and tossed aside all my life, I just want to feel NORMAL. And I feel like that will never happen. I feel like I'm missing out on such a huge part of life. People talk about relationships all the time and shit, and it makes me feel so excluded to know that I'll probably never have one. But more than that, I feel like I'll always have some lingering shred of anxiety and depression, and that I'll always be different from other people. 

I honestly don't know what to do. I don't want to feel this way. I just want to be normal. But I don't know how to improve myself. I desperately don't want to kill myself. But I can't keep going on like this. I can't keep going on being inherently inferior to everyone else. I feel like if things don't get better in the next few years I'll end up killing myself. But I really don't want to. I just don't know what to do... I just want someone who isn't my family to care about me deeply. But I feel like that'll never happen."

"Lose my kids or lose all my friends and communityFor the last 7 months, I've been prospecting for a motorcycle club, a support system for veterans who, like me struggle with mental health. It's hands down the best cultural fit for me. I don't fit in anywhere with normal people. Normal people are all like another culture where I don't belong.   
My kids mom and her family are terrified or COVID. She's said that either I cease all activities with the club, which would disqualify me from membership, or not be able to see my kids again until there is a vaccine.   
I'm starting to resent her and the club for their combined lack of flexibility and understanding. I want to leave it all."

When I woke up this morning, I was on my bed slumped over against my bedroom wall. My arms parallel to one another, facing away from my sides. My head also slumped over. Normally I would have found that weird, but I was too distracted by how great I felt. Youâd think that after a nights sleep like that, Iâd be in a lot of pain, but Iâve never felt better

I just brush it off as something I must have done in my sleep, and pick up my book. Itâs a book about realization. Itâs contains a lot of real stories about how  someone realized something about themselves and how it completely changed their lives. I really like it so far. I hope some day something like these stories will happen to me. 

And then I hear the front door open. My parents are back! Theyâve been in a lot of emotional distress recently, so they went on a vacation... I think. They havenât been talking to me for a while now, so I can only assume they went on this vacation because of me. As I head towards the stairs, I can hear them talking. Except it doesnât sound like them... these arenât my parents. 

I stop dead in my tracks. Part of me wants to go down there and tell them theyâre in the wrong house. But what if theyâre bad people? What if they try to hurt me? Instead, I double back and hide under my bed.



-




Itâs been a couple of hours now, and they havenât left. Theyâve been coming in and out for the past couple of hours. Are they moving in? They eventually stop and, from what I can hear, start checking out each room in the house. They eventually get to mine. 

The door opens and I hear the lady gasp. 

âIs- is this it?â she asks. 

The room falls silent, but I can tell the man nods. 

I want to start crying but I tell myself, â*No Eliot, theyâll hear you!*â. They leave the room, closing the door behind them. I want to leave but Iâm too scared. Iâll stay for now. They got to leave some time, right?



-



Itâs been three days, and they havenât left. All Iâve heard is them laughing, talking about how they want to spend the rest of their lives in this place. Iâm starting to get angry. Iâve been under this bed for three days, and I donât plan on spending another second here. I crawl out and head towards the stairs, when I see something in my parentâs room that catches my eye. 

Itâs filled with boxes and framed photographs of the couple. But that wasnât what caught my eye. My fathers gun, just sitting there on the dresser. I donât know why, but I grab it and head downstairs to find the couple. 

Everything is so different now. There are tons of boxes stacked to the ceiling, just waiting to be opened. I stop at the bottom of the stairs, when I hear the couple talking in the living room. The lady says she found this framed picture in the basement and something about âthis is what they looked likeâ? But Iâm too angry to pay attention. 

When I arrive at the living room, the lady looks up at me, and screams. The man does the same. I look at both of them and ask,

âWhat are you doing in my home?â

They donât respond. They look terrified. I wasnât sure why, until I saw I was still holding the gun. I look back up at them and I realize they arenât even looking at me, theyâre looking at the gun. I wave it around and their eyes follow. 

They donât even see me. 

This fills me with rage. And before I even realize it, I shoot the man. Two time in the chest, one in the neck. Blood splatters all over the ladyâs face, as she screams and cries after watching her lover die. I shoot the lady until Iâm out of bullets. 

I grab the picture they weâre looking at, and take a look. I notice my reflection right away. Itâs been days since Iâve seen myself. I look normal, except I notice a dried blood stream on the left side of my cheek, and two holes on my temples. One roughly the size of a bullet.  And then I see the picture itself. 

Itâs me. 

And itâs not the picture that surprises me, itâs the words above it.

"conflicting values, suffering, etc etcwhen do you sacrifice your own values and or beliefs for some other good? and how do you even make this judgement considering that your values and beliefs can shift? and when you cant tell what good or lack of good will come from each decision?

i am left to make multiple decisions based on this, its utterly impossible.

the most pressing and relevant one for here is that of death. as it stands, i currently dont think any amount of good is worth even the smallest amount of suffering. therefore, life shouldnt exist. however, obviously, i cant just have the whole world die, and the vast vaat majority dont share this belief anyways. and im not even sure if i believe it, i cant tell.

because of this, i feel it is right to die. me living causes suffering elsewhere, lots that im not even aware of, just based upon how global society is built up, how, essentially, our global economic system functions. and of course there are other reasons, as youd expect from someone posting here, i think im a bad person for a multitude of reasons, and whatever good i have is outweighted by it. but really, thst is secondary and can be ignored in this case.

the problem is, since the entire world isnt joining me, my suicide itself would cause pain. the best i could do is make it look like an accident, still not too much better though. regardless, i cant tell if me just living is the better option or not. both options, commiting and not, seem wrong.

i do have this drive to die, perhaps from mental illness (if youd like to call it that), that has me even consider this, i guess since i dont feel bound to the idea that living us a good thing (from what i understand this isnt common). im not sure if i am ill or its the world, blinded by their own brains telling them life is good so they stay alive, instead of the truth, that life isnt.

essentially, i have no time to make a decision. i can push this back again a couple of months, like i recently did, which is a decision to stay, at least temporaraly. my grades in uni are about to tank if i dont get back to work, so i have to do something. just lost really. and being dead would absolve me of all of this. and this is not the only situation in which i have to make a choice of this kind, there is at least one more that involves conflicting values that i have to figure out, although its a bit less time-sensitive and less final as well."
"Glad I made itHey guys. Wanted to share this, incase it helps anyone. 

In November of 2015, I attempted suicide. It didn't work. Not even close. I thought it would, and I was totally prepared to die. When it didn't, I felt a mixture of disappointment and relief. 

Cut to: last October 2016. I was better, definitely better, but no where near close to being healed. I was depressed most weeks, and I often thought about suicide. This lasted up until around the beginning of January. Until then, I was still healing, and still trying to just get through life. 

Cut to: March 2017. I'd been feeling so much better. I was enjoying life, and for the first time in ages, I was enjoying getting out and going to class, and even seeing people. That's why I didn't see that Tuesday coming. Out of no where, the feelings hit me, and it was as if they'd never left. I was on campus, looking at everyone around me, feeling completely alone and completely done. I was determined to try again, only this time I wouldn't mess up.  
Only this time, my boyfriend saved me. He talked me through it, helped me through the night, and by the next morning I was on my way to feeling better again. You know how these things go. 

Finally, cut to: the end of March. I decided to begin applying for jobs (I graduate college in May.) I applied, and got denied, to many many places. I was beginning to get distraught, and I felt hopeless. At this point, I didn't know why I was alive. It felt like I had nothing going for me, and I was doomed to be worthless. (This process for me technically started in January, but I focused a lot on it in March.)
A week later a saw a job posting for a position that looked like it would fit me. Not thinking anything of it, or expecting a reply, I sent in my application. The next day I got an interview. That same day I was hired. 

Since then, it's only April. Today is April 22nd, 2017, and I am so thankful I was never successful in ending my life. This job that I thought nothing of, has changed my life. It is the job of my dreams. Each day I walk in to work so excited, and so so incredibly happy. After my first day, the first thing I thought to myself was ""thank god I lived."" 

Things CAN change. Things CAN turn around. I'm not saying I still don't struggle, or that I won't ever struggle again. Hell most nights are still hard, haha. But because I made it through, I got to experience this incredible opportunity to work for my dream company, doing what I LOVE to do. It only took 2 days for things to get dramatically better. 2 days. It's unfortunate I suffered for so long, and that most people have to, but I just wanted to tell someone my story in case anyone else feels trapped in how their life is going. I think I'll always struggle, but at least now I'm happy most days.

Everyone is so busy or having a good time without me. I feel like someone I choking me and pushing me into the floor and I canât get up. When I feel like I might be able to do something basic like eating or going to the bathroom I just break down again.

This week I went through a breakup. Even writing that word it doesnât feel right. It was the only person keeping me alive these past two years and now without him Iâm alone again, whatâs worse is my family and friends had no clue how bad Iâve been these months so theyâre unprepared when I come to them and ignore me or give me crap advice like âexercise or take a break and relaxâ. No one picks up their phone or texts back, if they do they sigh in annoyance and give an excuse to hang up quickly.

Today is maybe the last day for me. I donât see myself past this week and every time I get to this point it feels less and less like Iâll come out alive. Part of me wanted to try getting help but it looks so difficult I might just give up if this pain doesnât stop. Iâm gonna do it."

"Guys, it's been two years and growing; but I've realized that suicide my be the only way I can be happy.I am not a funny guy. I am not interesting or entertaining. Iâm that one guy who has zero to contribute to the conversation except my presence. I really have tried but after each attempt I am left no better than feeling stupid or worthless. My group of friends care about me but I think just because Iâve been around them a while. I look at their situation and see myself as someone who is easily replaceable. If I left, all I would be is an empty spot on the couch. Conversations would go on, activities would resume and the world will rotate as if nothing happened. Even when I talk to my family it seems distant in conversation and emotion. The only feeling I get out of the conversation with them is anger or nagging about how Iâve disappointed them again.  I have tried finding someone special to be with, a girlfriend but never had any success. Believe me. I have tried hard! but after all high school, two years of college and no successes, I just feel lost and done. Iâve only kissed two girls. This isnât a sudden feeling, it has been growing for the past two years. The one person who has made me feel best in the past two years I havenât even known. If Iâm no one to others and myself, what is really the point of carrying on. All I see in my futures is student loans and work. Life, it seems, is just not meant for me."

Itâs a burning desire to be even more successful. A burning desire to take everything to the next level yet I hold myself back.  Idk how to get around this obstacle that Iâve created for myself and i feel stuck, frozen."

"So my first period was CANCELED! My first period is AP Biology. Like most people, I kind of hate this class. So you must have felt my dismay when I woke up this morning and saw that it was time to start.       

But Alas! I receive a text from my group chat saying that my first period is canceled! The kids at school were having a substitute teacher! The teacher didn't know how to use Zoom, so we were off the hook!
          
Overjoyed, I returned back to my bed an catch up on some much needed sleep. I took note of how much time I had left until my 2nd period. All was good.       
         
Then I slept through my second period."
"8 days to go until I get some peace.Yeah 8 short days. I'm looking forward to it. I've planned who gets what, like things I won't be needing anymore.

"Should I be worried?   So I have intense bouts of overwhelming suicidal thoughts daily now. I have the means, I have a plan, I'm close to writing a note, but one thing makes me think I shouldn't actually be worried about hurting myself.

"Fuck the rule of no Headwear/hood is so fucking stupid and the people who actively try to enforce this. Fuck you tl;dr.    I have major anxiety problems and having to take of my hood worsens it a fuck ton

There are a lot of people with anxiety/self esteem/... issues who would rather never been seen in public at all (you guessed it that's me) and feel super fucking uncomfortable if they can't wear a hood to cover up their face. Idk if i speak for all but it literally worsens my  anxiety a hundred fold when i have to take it off. I get so anxious it's insane. I can't see a reason behind this rule except just because they can."

"Read this for a second.No, it's not a cry for help, I just want to lay out the truth.

I can say many things to you that you would like to hear but, the truth is that people are stop believing in themselves. They judge themselves by thinking how are they going to look to people, but that doesn't matter. The only thing someone else can do about your life is talk. They say that their life's a disaster, well there is know way of calculating that and if someone tells you that you ain't going to anything just smile at them and they will burn inside with their own anger.

I see positivity rarely. People look out for compliments and if they don't get them, they get sad and depressed. But I'll tell you what the biggest compliment is it is to have a positive mind. You'll notice that you feel happy even when you appreciate someone's work and get a thank-you in return.

Instead of focusing on what made you happy or what made you sad, just focus on what you're about to do to be happy and let those people around you talk about you again."

"not sure where to goI'm also not sure if this it the right sub reddit to use.

I rarely ever contribute on reddit and am more of a lurker, I'm the same way in my none reddit life. I just feel I have nothing constructive to say and I'm just generally anti social.
 
(a little background)

I come from an abusive family, my dad was a bi polar alcoholic and would beat me and made me feel worthless for the majority of my life. My mom eventually did a very brave thing and divorced him. But I fear the damage was already done.( I have been to therapy in the past and never found it overly useful) I've wanted to die as far back as I can remember. 

Now that that's out of the way, a couple of days ago I was half asleep alone in my apt,watching tv when I started to hear people yell for help I thought maybe someone had fallen/heart attack, something of the like so I got up, threw on some clothes and went to investigate. The first thing I see is a man in the hallway asking for help so I followed him to an apt a few doors down and when I got there I was shocked, busted door, blood everywhere, and to the right of my I see a man standing over a woman in a lot of pain with a huge knife.

I didn't know what to do,I'm not the most intimidating person (I resemble the comic book guy from the Simpsons) and this guy starts walking over to me and in that split second I was afraid of dying so I lied and told him that the cops where on the way (turns out someone had actually called them) he stood there for a few seconds and then ran off.

It took awhile but once the cops/paramedics arrived they got the woman to the hospital and brought me to the police station to give my statement. From what I've heard she is in a stable condition but haven't heard much else.

Right now I'm wishing this guy had killed me and I'm really fucked up emotionally and don't really know what to do. I can't really talk about this with my family they know some of the details of the events but not what I'm really going through, I'm usually an emotional wall and keep people at a distance, and my friends have all moved on with their lives and I don't want to involve them with this.

I will be going to bed for a little while as it is fairly late or early depending how you see it

"Why does it always fucking come backEven when 99% of life is great. I have friends, I get along with people, laugh almost every god. Dammed. Day. I'm no longer the loner with no friends, no longer the wierd kid.
But that 1 fucking % of time just drives me crazy and I can't handle it. It hurts and I don't wanna do it anymore. Why live a life that clearly doesn't want me since it's been fucking me over since my first memory."
So close to failing a classMy parents have such high expectations and i'm currently 2% away from failing my calculus class. I also have a test in this class in 6 hours and i know nothing. I'll probably kill myself before i officially fail. 
"My mental illness is taking control over my life and my family and bf are being affected by it. I just want to free them from the burden of having me in their lives.My partner of 2 years is the one who deals with my borderline personality often. Anything could cause me to split and suddenly hate him for no logical reason other than my emotional instability, and it just has worsened with the pass of the months. I know I have to get psychological help but it doesn't solve the problem immediatly. He would still have to deal with my mood changes until there is some significant improvement, and that may take years and years. 
The guilt that comes with this, knowing that with his own mental issues he's still trying to do everything to make me happy... It just destroys me and gives me an (apparently) justified reason to kill myself. So that he can move on from this toxic relationship and find someone healthy that will truly make him happy and give him all the positivity and love in the world. In this state of mind, I can barely reply to his ily's because of the amount of guilt. He says he's willing to stay with me and even pay for my mental health when he gets a job. This fucking tears me apart. How can somebody be so good with me when i've made his life impossible countless times, ugh.

My family doesn't know all the story behind my behaviour. My mother is the one who I turn to the most, but she doesn't understand how fucked up I really am. She just brushes it off saying the neurotypical arguments: ""It's just a phase, you'll get over it, there's people in the world with WORSE problems and you are getting sad out of nothing?!"" ...Well, yeah. That's why i'm asking for help in the first place. There's no fun in living like this.
On the other hand, my father said the same things as my mom, with the difference that he got me the number of a mental health center so that I can call and order an interview with someone and start treatment. I'm a little afraid about it tho, there's just too much happening right now and I would be ashamed to be seen in my lowest by a stranger. But I know It's part of getting help, opening up. 

Sorry for the wall of text, the typos and the incoherences, I just needed to vent somewhere."

"One day...Right now I'm somewhere in the midst of my third (that I can remember) period of suicidal ideation. I read and think about it a lot. I make mental plans of how and where, and if nothing else just hope that when the time does eventually come its as quick and easy as I can possibly make it. 
I have a husband and a daughter, two things that keep me rooted to my mortal coil. Not that I deserve them, nor do they deserve to be attached to a failure of a human such as myself. Life is a constant balancing act. Tired of living, but knowing what I would leave behind would damage the two people I love the most as much as I am damaged right now.
Life for me has never been on an upward trajectory. Every action usually comes with an equal, and often opposite reaction.
Have a baby? Great, prepare to find out 10 years later you've become naturally infertile.
Get married? Sure, just to spend the rest of my life mentally and financially draining my poor husband because my own career prospects are slim to none.
Get a job? Okay, but you gotta work menial jobs in the catering industry with a long term back problem for the rest of your life, because you were a horrendously mediocre student, didn't go to university, are thousands in debt because you don't earn enough to get by, therefore sponging off your husband and long suffering parents.
Every attempt to better myself or my situation has been met with a brick wall. The doctors dont care, my few friends all have their own lives going on so I don't want to inflict my misery on them. My parents are getting old now, they don't need me as a constant burden. My husband and daughter have a much better chance of making their lives better long term without me around dragging them down. I feel like a walking, talking appendix. Ultimately useless and not needed, my only functions are obsolete or undesirable. I often wish I would develop an aggressive illness and die swiftly, at least then I wouldn't leave behind any unanswered questions or loose ends."
"I'm just a burden to societyI'm disabled and can't work, so I rely on taxes, but taxes are evil, and the government shouldn't help anyone. At least that's what most Americans seem to think. I don't contribute to society, I don't have any children, most of my family disowned me. I literally have no reason to live. I'm nothing but a leech."

&amp;#x200B;

 

So I'm 19 years old, a female, and I just came to college in August 2018. I have struggled with mental illness since I was like 6th-ish grade. I started cutting when I got dumped by my first girlfriend. (I can't move on. It was so long ago but I've never moved on 100%) It wasn't to manipulate her or anything, it was just the only way I knew how to deal with the crushing heartbreak I felt. Things got worse. January of 2015, I took about 15 OTC sleeping pills; they didn't kill me. Things continued to get worse. My mother began to cheat on my father. Thanksgiving weekend 2015, my mother dragged me and my younger sister to her lover's house two hours away. I hated it. When we came back, my father pretty much knew but didn't say anything. Then, my mother, had me lie about our Christmas plans. With the threat of the impending nuclear meltdown that was my family, I took two bottles of OTC sleeping pills and waited to die. My parents found me but were going to leave me. My sister begged them to take me to the emergency room. I was hospitalized overnight in the emergency room before being sent to the loony bin for a week. I got out Christmas Eve, though my mother still dragged me down to her woman's house. I fought the urge to kill myself there, and started to actively try to get better

I got on some medicine and it was helping a little bit, but I moved states (for college) and I haven't been able to see a new psychiatrist so I've been out of meds for a couple months. I'm also terrified of going to the new doctor because I want to lose weight before I go. I don't want to be introduced to my psychiatrist as a fatty. I can tell already that I'm severely depressed, which I'm so fucking familiar with that I can handle it.

Two things are worrying me though. First off, for the first time since I'm starting to see things. I keep thinking I see/hear things that I know aren't there. I'm seeing people and not just shadows, but fully formed nightmare things. In class, in the window, in the shower. I'm always on edge, wondering when the next thing is gonna show up. And I swear I'm hearing animal noises and grunts and stuff.

Second of all, tonight I actually said out loud, for the first time since 2015, that I wanted to kill myself. I honestly don't think I ever got over passively wanting to die but I haven't thought or said that I actively wanted to make an attempt on my life since I was 16. And I just said it. I don't mean it, or at least I think I don't mean it right now.

Basically, I'm just at a loss right now. I'm terrified to go to the doctor and be branded as a fat ass (2014/2015ish I struggled with anorexia) but I also know that there's a possibility of severe relapse if I don't take care of this.

I'm just so scared and empty. I don't know what to do."
"Today is the last day of my vacation, but I don't know if I'll make it to work againI've never had a higher volume of suicidal thoughts than I have these past few months, ESPECIALLY these past few days. It's no longer about, ""Jesus, I can't take this anymore."" It's to the point of being, ""well, I wouldn't want anyone to have to clean up that mess, what if I...""

I don't know what else to say, I just need to get out. I can't find one reason (that I actually care about) to stay."

"Give me a reason.  If i'm being completely honest, the only reason i'm here is because it's alot easier to unload my thoughts and feelings to a faceless mass of people than my friends and families. I'm not even completely sure if this is where I should be. I want to die, but perhaps a better way to put it would be, I wish I wasn't me. 

What pushed me to post here was a conversation I had with my mother. She said, in no uncertain terms, that because my grades in school weren't top of the class or as good as my peers, I was worthless, useless, and pointless. She continued to elaborate, at lengths, about how I did nothing in high school, i'm worthless in college, i've never made her happy in all my life, and how I was a complete and utter waste of time. I asked her one question. I asked her, aren't I more than a couple of numbers and letters? She said no. 

I don't disagree with her. Well, most of me doesn't. My friends are all going to fancy colleges, have straight A's, and are amazing, bright, intelligent people. And, that's not exaggeration or hyperbole. That's the honest to god truth. One friend got a full-ride to college. Another is in an exclusive 16-person only physics group. 2 more got decent scholarships to berkeley. And they all have somewhere between 4.00 and 5.00 gpa's. I'm not even sure how we're friends. They all have shining futures and brilliant lives to live. I'm nothing like them. 

I talked some of those same people out of some pretty deep points in their lives. I've talked one of them out of suicide. I helped them on the tracks that their on in my own, minuscule ways. But I could only do that because I knew what they had ahead of them. I knew they were all people worth pushing towards life. They were worthwhile people, with worthwhile reasons to live. I'm not.

To address the title, i'm asking if someone, anyone can give me a reason not to disappear. Not to walk away from everything and die quietly, where I won't make waves. I'm not a person worth saving, and I have little purpose left, so give me a reason. I'll answer any questions anyone might have as honestly as I can for the next hour or so. And then I'm gone, like breath on the wind."
"I just can't do this anymore.I have past posts with specifics about my garbage life if anyone actually wanted to read it, but the tl;dr is no job, no local friends, no money, family that likes to give shitty generic advice ""just move your sleep schedule, just get some exercise.""


I can't do it anymore.  I can't find a job - everything I apply to in my field just doesn't get back to me; I really don't want to work retail.  I can't go out in this city because I have no money and my abusive ex still lives in the area and I don't want to run into him.  I can't just make friends when I have no money to go out.  I absolutely hate living at home with my family and a crappy retail job won't allow me to move out on my own.


Last time things got close to this bad, I used to get through the day by remembering that I was never more than 20 minutes away from not having any problems anymore, but I don't think I can handle this cesspool of a life anymore.


Thanks for the support in getting off cymbalta, and sorry for wasting everyone's time."

What are some nostalgic clips for you Just wondering Iâm compiling some for a thing
"I feel like no one believes how serious your mental health is unless youâre successful in your suicide attempt..Even if you fail, some people will claim that youâre attention seeking or being over dramatic. But the second youâre gone, the whole energy changes to âwe shouldâve helped moreâ

I donât fucking get it. Itâs only when someone is officially 100% GONE that people want to start caring about mental health.

But then I think to myself.. itâs my life, not theirs. Why SHOULD they worry about me anyways? Itâs not their job to make sure Iâm happy or sane.


I hope thereâs a better place out there after all this."
Just me? You guys ever just vibing and having a chill day and then it hits you. Damn I'm ugly as fuck. No? Just me then? Huh
"When you have people around you and yet you feel alone.Hello I'm here because I feel as if Im need of some help. (of course I  really don't want to have to need it, I want to take care of it on my own)  
Like many others I have had thought in my head that for some reason tell me I'm a worthless piece of shit and that I don't deserve anything. Of course the things that happen to me in my life involving 0. (family,friends and love life) just kinda justify the thoughts in my head. 
Iv always thought that I can never hurt myself because it's would only really be hurting the ppl I care about and that care about me but its been increasingly difficult to push all those thoughts back and I just want to end it to not have to feel  all this bullshit. 
I have friends but the majority live out of town now, I message them to talk sometime and sometimes get really down and ask them to talk because I just need a friend at the moment (they will answer sometimes but usually not). 
I talk to my family and they just say the samething(telling me im not worthless but not really giving me justification to why I'm not, I know they love me but I also know it's not enough)
Iv felt like this for so long now that I just don't want to involve other ppl anymore and feel like I would just be a burden  on everyone if I tried to do so.
And I know my life could be alot worse and that others lives are probably worse in someways but whenever I think of that I just feel guilt for feeling this way.
I feel so alone all the time I feel like I'm living in a world where all I want it to just not be alive anymore and I just feel trapped like I can't do anything."
"public suicide ?im going to kill myself, not soon, but eventually. the thing is i really don't want my parents or siblings to be the one to find me because i know the image will never leave their head. what is a painless and quick way to die in public ?"
"Thinking of just ending it all.I need reasons not to, other than the usual âyoure so worth itâ and âother people will be sadâ."
"I am ready to go.I am trapped, and I do not know how long I can linger on. Earlier today I ordered some meds and some other substance that will arrive in few days, and I have started writing my letters to my closest ones.

I have been haunted by my past, and I do not know if i can deal with my memories anymore. I have been living in a constant fear these years. In the same time I dont even know if there will be a future for me.

I am gay, and I am an asylum seeker due to my sexual orientation. Due to the immigration crisis in 2015, immigration in europe basically has been turning table, they basically reject and deport everyone except the one from syria. Being back to my home country is not an option, unless i want to be jailed, going to conversion therapy or being exorcist, or being mobbed by the locals. To be honest, I prefer to die in dignity than being sent back there.

I dont know if this life is worth fighting for, I do not know if i want to be alive if I ended up in jail or being mobbed by the locals. While most people having a huge dream, my only dream is to finally find a place that i can call home, and if they did not allow me to live in peace, i dont really mind to rest in peace.

Now tell me, is there any reason why I should stay alive?"

"9:17pm/ Wednesday, December 9th, 2020I was gonna wait until the 18th of this month to do it, but I can't deal with it anymore. I've tried everything I could to get help, but yet it's not working. If this attempt doesn't work, then I guess I'll just have to wait until next time."
"I was told to kill myself, and part of me is slowly wanting to go with it.I fucked up.
I hurt someone, and in understanding rage, they told me to kill myself.
I've been trying to do better after this whole ordeal, most of my life really.
But...maybe they're right. 
If I just did, I wouldn't hurt anyone else again.
 I feel my want to get better just slipping and it scares me how much I want to make it reality.

I'm sorry...."

"I didnât think I was going to be alive for as long as I am and Iâm not prepared for my futureI practically threw away my life around middle of senior year of high school. Grades falling, losing friends, stress at home was too much, and that was also when I had my first attempt. Thinking about now, Iâm so not ready for the rest of life. Itâs just misery in the future so whatâs the real point of keeping my hopes up? Iâve made a vow to myself that if my life doesnât get better by the end of the year, Iâll end it right before the new decade. So far, it looks like Iâm on that path; itâs only gotten worse. Sorry folks."

"I wanna kill myself but also notLong story short: Grew up with an alcoholic dad. My dad's parents where alcoholics themselves until they actually drank themselves to death pretty quickly. My uncle (his brother) drinks, too. It's a family issue. I made the decision to don't touch that stuff any further after the first try-out as a teenager. I could feel that alcohol and me is no good mix. My mom was co-addicted. She did let all that shit happen and never left him. She only ever threatened him to do so and he just had to cry and promise he would stop tomorrow, or next week or whenever and all that shot did go on and on and on. 



He was also never there for me although I was mainly HIS LOVECHILD. My mom already had two girls and would have been fine with no further kids. He was also happy with me being a girl. And he didn't want me anymore. He always said he said he loves me, and to be honest, he was the only person of the family who ever said those three words to me and would give me a hug, but then ran away again at the very moment. My mom was so frustrated about my dad that she was mad all the time, she always said and did mean things to me, sometimes she would join my dad drinking and 'cause she wasn't used to those amounts of alcohol she would vomit all over the bathroom and then I either had to clean it up or hold my piss until the next day and last but not least, as soon as I was a teen she give up on my dad and let me babysit him. Main problem was that he would always fell asleep drunk with a cigarette and let that fall to the ground. One morning there was a big whole burned into the carpet. Really really good luck that the fire stop by itself somehow. So, since I didn't look forward to die in a fire, I did babysit him the whole night long. Sitting next to him with all of his different moods. Aggressive (though he never hit me or so), depressive, sad, mean, disgusting. One night he cried like a baby how shit everything is and that he can't and doesn't wanna stop drinking. 



That was too much for me and during that time I started to have panic attacks. I dropped out of school and had to do psychotherapy. It never realy helped that much, maybe 'cause I never adressed the alcoholism in my family. It was a taboo. Other than yelling at each other every once in a while 'cause we couldn't take it anymore, we kept silent. Living in denial. My aunt (his sister) played a big role as well. She was quite a bit the self-proclaimed leader of the family. She was pretty strict about us having to shut our mouths. My mom asked her for help several times ans she got extremly aggressive about it. My other uncle (their brother) was in therapy as well 'cause of their drinking parents and kept it a secret from everyome else but me and my mom 'cause he was afraid of his siblings reaction. 



I finally reached out to my older halfsisters (booth over adecade older than me, we have the same mom but all different dads, though the dad of one is also the step-dad of he other which she sees as her real dad). Biggest fault ever in my whole life! They have huge problems with our mom, for a good reason, but instead of helping me getting rid of my anxiety disorder which would enable me to get rid of my parents, they put all their energy into stirrung me up against our mom. They told all evil things my mom did to them - just imagine me: I was sitting in psychiatry, which they put me into, crippled with anxiety from head to toe - and all they did was keeping on tellin me: Mom did this! And that! Bla bla bla... And some stories where even FAKED! The worst one was where they used a closed family friend for a fake story who actually comitted suicide! 



Of course this DIDN'T heal my anxiety, so I went back home. Because thruth to be told, my anxiety was so bad at that time, I was unable to live alone. My sisters told me at that time it's OK. Sister #2 told me she'd be going on vacation. Then her number didn't work anymore. For YEARS sister #1 told me everything's fine and that sister #2 is just so busy. I was stupid for long enough but then it wasn't possible to lie to me anymore, so sister #1 told me: sister #2 wants no contact to me until I move out and cut all ties to our mom. THAT IS EMOTIONAL BLACKMAILING!!! Especially 'cause I was NOT ABLE  to move out! I had anxiety and I was broke. They never had any issues with anxiety, they have a loving dad who always gives them money when needed and they pretty much never had to live alone by themselves since they always jump from one relationship/marriage right into the next. And she didn't atleast tell me that face to face! She always let's other people deliever their messages. Also really mean ones. When my anxiety was getting better I let out niece ask her (I cannot contact her directly, she even blocks me on FB) if we could met somewhere else, where our mom isn't present. She let my niece deliver me the message that even that is impossible, 'cause as long as I haven't cut tie with our mom, I'm contaminated to her. I feel DISGUSTING since that! 



And if that wasn't enough my dad chimes in. I was finally fed up with his alcoholic antics. Since he left my mom for a better co-addict and actually left his child as well instead helping me going through therapy at least one little bit, he treats me like shit. He disappears and then reappears all of the sudden, meeting me and making me hopes again, only to let me down 5min before our next meeting. Drunk-calls. Driving drunk with me. I started visiting Al-Anon which he got very angry about. Then he drops the next blackmailing: NO CONTACT UNTIL I ADMIT THAT HE IS NO AND NEVER WAS AN ALCOHOLIC. On my 30st birthday he send me a message: ""Happy birthday, darling! I'd be so happy to hear from you as soon as your ready to admit that I'm not an alcoholic!"". 



I also cut ties with sister #1 and my niece 'cause I couldn't take it anymore how they always protect sister #2's behaviour, not understanding my pain due to my dad and saying really mean things about that, like I would be a good thing if he drunk-drives himself to death because I'd get the money then, and concentrating everything on our mom (again, yes she was a bad mom, but that is something I can actually deal with, my emotional distress comes from that other things). 



So... long story short didn't really work, however... this is my life at 30 now! A FUCKED UP MESS! And I see no light at the end of the tunnel, and if it rather seems to be the light of the train riding over me. 



I was born as a happy baby. Bright. Defiantly shy and introverted, yes. But creative. I was into so many creative stuff beginning from a young age and I had so many and such big dreams. I know that Iand only myself are responsible for me but I'm also just human like anyone else and I need only a little bit of love and support. Not even much, just a tiny bit. 



Therefore I dunno if I can keep on living. I WANT to and make all my dreams come true, but even if I would make to technically, like getting rid of anxiety, having a job and move out with my mom: Just HOW could I ever become happy after all this shit? Memories about this will never fade and scars never heal. All those lost time. My niece said to me 'cause I'm 30 I'm old and already wasted most of my live (as if this is all my idea) so I should finally start living until I'm 6ft under anyway. At the moment wish I'd rather be 6ft under RIGHT NOW. I feel so stressed 'cause of this. My heart is pumping and head hurting like shit all the time. I also blame myself so much. I shoud have go to someone when I was 16 or so and asked to be put in a foster home. Or at least not waste so much time trying to keep the family together instead of just fuck them, get into psychiatry as long as needed, sacrifice my dreams and just get a shit job that is enough to pay a rent and then just leave them and call it day. But no, I must be this fucking failure. I would like to try to live a happy life but I just feel like giving up and go just die..."

"My dad beats my autistic brother and I am tired of it Yep, the title says it all. I heard my dad beat him with a belt for 2 minutes straight because my brother went to someone's house without permission. We are in lockdown for 7 days, so the rules are tighter. My mother tries to tell my dad to stop beating my brother with a belt, and it worked, until now. Now, my brother is not allowed to go to people's houses, and, apparently, my brother also goes to her ex's house and a ex teacher of his. He doesn't use common sense very often after our first major lockdown, so he got himself into this situation.

What should I do? Should I intervene, or should I stay out? Currently, my brother feels lonely, so I talk to him."

Donât feed me the âIt gets betterâ bullshit, because I know it doesnât. I have nothing to make me unhappy, and plenty of things to make me happy, but Iâm still totally fucking miserable. As I said I have a girlfriend, plenty of normal friends that Iâm very close with, great relationship with both my parents, get good grades. Iâm not sick, or poor, or disabled, or bullied, but I still feel totally miserable. If this isnât enough to make me feel happy, then what is?"

If not, and I go to hell, what difference does it make, I was gonna end up there anyway.

Also if anyone could recommend an easy and quick method of suicide Iâd appreciate it. Iâve been searching for weeks but I canât find anything accessible to me that actually leaves me with some semblance of dignity."

I donât want to move on with my lifeI have been isolating myself and getting pretty deep into a black hole of depression recently. Iâm supposed to graduate college in May but thereâs nothing that I want to live for. I do not have any skills or passions and no job or next step lined up. I donât want to burden anyone in my life by talking to them about this. I havenât seen my friends in a while. Iâm not close with my family. Everything hurts me so I just donât do anything or talk to anyone. I donât know what to do at this point. Iâve stopped drinking because I think thatâs when Iâm most likely to have the courage to kill myself. I also canât afford my medication so will have to be off of it until I get paid on Friday. Iâm trying to take care of myself and go outside. Iâm hurting so bad and Iâm not sure what else I can do at this point 
"I've turned into such a loser, I have so much hate for myselfI've flunked out of uni, almost flunked out of community college (albeit doing well now), been fired from a fast food job for a drinking problem (I stopped drinking, eventually), lost all passion and motivation for what I used to love, and failed miserably at independent living.

I've scuttled around between living with my parents and both my sisters (I'm back with my parents now, I fucked up too many times with my sisters), but I still have no handle on myself. The one time I tried being an independent adult I managed to lose ALL of my friends - literally none of them talk to me anymore because I either pissed them off or I wasn't able to get back to them consistently enough to be worth their time.

I'm transgender (fucking cliche, right? How many of these do you guys get?) and my parents know, but I'm such a piece of work. Shit-ugly as a boy, nowhere near passable as a girl. Why the fuck should I even bother? I feel worse if I don't, though, which is *really* saying something. Regardless, I can't even take myself seriously, most days I just try to pretend I don't have a gender so I don't have to think about it. My life is too much of a mess to worry about this right now, anyway.

I was smart, funny, musical, fucking *talented*, and full of potential, back in high school - and the stuff I did showed it.  Where the fuck am I now? Im a horrible, horrible, horrible failure. I have no inspiration, unchecked emotions that I don't know what to do with (I just accidentally broke my parents' laptop screen and cried/hyperventilated for twenty minutes about it), and such a difficult climb back up. Even if I can make it, I still have all this shit in my head that gets triggered easily. I remember the bad stuff too well, one trigger leads to a very fast, downward spiral.

I don't like anything about who i've become. Nothing. I don't like the superficial things, the mental things, the emotional things, behavioral, etc. I can't fucking *do anything* anymore. I'm 21 but I feel like my life is over already. Why try? Why even fucking try?

Sorry this is so poorly written, I haven't felt this bad in weeks, my head's not on straight. I also haven't been open with anyone in close to a year so everything's spilling out."

"UglyThis species is fucking terrible. I wish we would get hit by a meteor, or global warming ends us, or nuclear war.

We deserve it. What is the point of being alive if you're ugly?  To get gossiped about in public?  To have people gawk at you and laugh at you but not talk to you?  To make sure you never feel any pleasure or joy unless you pay for it? WHY ARE PEOPLE SO BASE?

The older I get the more I hate people and the less I want to go outside or interact with anyone. What's the point? The point is to be born good looking or have a perfect personality or you are nothing, apparently. No suggestions ever helped. Self-improvement is a dead-end and doesn't change what matters -- your base looks. I don't understand. Where is the humanity? Where is this thing called love? It seems to fall into place with attractive people ALL THE FUCKING TIME.

So this is it?  It's about being ugly and that's your life, you get old and die, and everything you do is without reward or pleasure because pleasure is for beautiful people even if they can't properly speak. This is the world around me. Where is the world others talk about? Where are the non-superficial people?  People say they exist, where are they. WHERE ARE THEY?!?!

It makes me sad because you can't talk about this with anyone. My family will wonder why even though I begged for help for years on end. No one ever helped, no one introduced me to anyone, no one gave anything but backhanded platitudes. Is it really looks? I know when I cover most of my body perfectly in nice clothing people are nicer, but only when I wear many layers. When they see what I am they don't care.

I don't understand and am panicking.  Where do people meet REAL FRIENDLY NONSUPERFICIAL PEOPLE or is LOVE now only for the beautiful? I don't understand and the more people say this isn't the case, the harder it is to exist in a world where it clearly is.

WHAT THE FUCK? The longer I am alive, the more time I spend around people, the more I hate them. How could you ever not hate something so superficial and base?  THIS was what we evolved to be?  The fuck. So is the only justice dismantling everything like the Koch brothers, because people don't deserve it because they're ANIMALS WHO CHOOSE TO ACT EVEN MORE ANIMALISTIC BECAUSE IT FEELS GOOD?

I can't spend time outside anymore and I hate people. All I ever wanted was an explanation. Are people really THAT base and LIE about it THAT MUCH?  I think suicide by cop is probably easiest. What do you think?"

"I'm going for a walk.I never thought I'd actually attempt suicide. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but never acted upon them. It was like I was a different person.
I was ready to die that night, when I thought I lost everything for the second time. The first time I lost everything, living was so awful, it's hard to put in words. It was all my fault. I wanted to be punished, and death was the only suitable punishment. 
I cried until I couldn't cry, and then I would cry more. I didn't have anyone, but I didn't deserve that. In so much pain, I was already as good as dead. 
Even in my darkest abyss, however, there is a light. I survived, and fought for a second chance. This time around, the light was gone. I had lost something important to me. My fault again. 
As soon as I realized, my soul had left. My thoughts left my mind, and I lost my voice.
It was about 9:30 PM, below freezing. I opened the door, with my brother asking where I was off to. 
""I'm going for a walk,"" I managed to say. 
Only wearing shorts, a t-shirt, a light jacket, and sneakers, I just started walking. Wasn't going anywhere, just walking. I was hoping to freeze to death, or get hit by a car. I fell a few times because of the ice and snow, but I kept walking. 
I was outside for an hour. There was no turning back now. I didn't even know where I was. As I was ready to inflict more pain on myself, I got a phone call. From my mother. She noticed I was out for a while. Listening to her voice, sobbing, I snapped out of it. I didn't want to die, nobody does. I was just terrified of living in guilt. I was terrified of living like I did when I lost everything. But I didn't lose everything. 
After the call, I had to get back home. I didn't realize how dark, scary, and cold it was. Instead of walking, I ran. Following my own footsteps, I ran the whole way back home. Felt like Forest Gump. I was exhausted.
In the lights of my house, I notice my hands were a deep blue. Everything hurt. I looked in the mirror, I looked like someone else. 
When my mother called, my phone was at 1%. If it wasn't on, I would be dead today.


Sorry if this doesn't make a lot of sense, I left out a lot of details. I just wanted to put this somewhere. I'm sorry for anyone who has go to through things like this, and I hope they make it out alive."
"Life is a vicious circleYou know, there was this one moment, where I started to realize, how shitty my life was the last few months. As usual, love is part of this. There was this one girl, I loved her from November '16 until last month. I thought so, but I think the last 3 months have been ""wanna-be love"", because I don't have a person I can talk to everytime and about everything. I started chatting with another girl. It was different from the beginning. Girl A always tried to reject me as quick as possible while exploiting me in a few ways. Everytime I texted her, I got very short answers, if I got an answer at all. But now it was different. She always answered me no matter how long it would take, she was more friendly, it was like perfect. I felt like there was somebody caring about me. But there was a problem. Our current class will be split up next school year because we get into 11th grade (germany). And the moment I realized, that I probably will not see her often, showed me, how much I love her. And thats where it starts again. I love her, but she doesn't love me for sure. And thats where I start questioning again, why I am here. If this would be the only problem, I probably could handle it. But it isnt. I was on a class trip, and the day went back home, I was pretty happy to be at home again. But I expected too much. The first thing which happened when I got back home, was my mother complaining about me. Thats when I started crying. And I don't cry a lot, but I needed to cry. Because I felt like nobody cares about me, I'm just there to be exploited. I take my time for others, just to get really nothing back or just complains. And that hurt me. I started thinking about suicide already days before. And I know, I couldn't do it anyways, but I felt like it would be better to just end it here and now. But I can't just cut myself, neither to just distract myself nor to kill myself. And this would probably be the only possibility right now. And I don't want to leave her. I imagine so many life situations that would be so nice with her, but she already rejected me. I think she knows that I love her, but when I asked her whether she wants to do sth with me, she just answered maybe. MAYBE. FUCKING SAY NO. But I can't leave her anyways, I don't want her to feel like she would be responsible for my death. And thats the vicious circle I was talking about. Everything I do, would end up in another negative thing. I know that love can't and should'nt be forced, but she is the only thing that keeps me from finding a way to stop it here and now the least painful way. If you ever read this, Louisa, when I'm dead, I loved you."

"I give upIâve tried everything and Iâm so fucking tired, why does everything seems to be in the right place and I still want to die? How can I be such an ungrateful piece of shit? Even my therapist is giving up on me, so... yeah, I do too. Iâm not sure how much time I have left."
"I'm trapped and there's genuinely only one way to get outI'm not very good about speaking what's on my mind. Especially not in person and I'm awful at just speaking and being a functioning human in society. I've never been a part of society like the majority. I've never made friends very easily and the few I do make I can't keep bc idk how to be a good friend. As much as I try my mind always finds a way to tell me toxic little things. Like how much they hate me, how they think I'm fat and ugly, how they think I'm too weird or maybe even slow in the head. Maybe I am a little slow or maybe I'm just bad at being what everyone else expects me to be. I'm not saying anyone wants me to be perfect but I can't even meet the basic standards. Maybe it's bc I'm unmedicated and have a string of mental illnesses plotting to ruin my life. I am bi polar but people can get through that and learn how to live with it. So idk why I can't. I have severe anxiety and social situations seem almost impossible to handle correctly. But most people learn how to cope and just get by or at least try. 

Anyway I wont get into everything that is ""wrong with me"" but I know there is something truly wrong with my head regardless what anyone tells me. Everytime someone tells me it'll get better or anything along the lines of trying to help me, all I can think about is how fake they are or even if they are truly genuine if they understood everything I feel and everything I've been through maybe they would see that ending it is what's best for me. Ending it is the true mercy that I hope I'll find sooner rather than later. I have my reasons and I won't explain them all bc I don't believe I have to explain myself at all to anyone. When it comes down to it what I do with my body and my life is my choice. No one should be able to take that away from me. I've been hospitalized and I've tried to end it before. I obviously didn't put my full will into it bc here I am. I told myself I would never go back to being in a mental ward ever again. It's either go through with it and make sure nothing can go wrong or stay and keep living and stop being so fragile and ""selfish"" or ""pathetic"". I don't think my family or anyone else thinks I could ever actually do it. They might be surprised one day. I think about the sweet closure of death everyday. It's become normal to me and I can feel how far away I am from everyone else. It feel like I'm galaxies away from every single person and I'll never reach them no matter how hard I try or how hard I want to. 

Ik probably no one will even read this. I'm sorry. If reading any of this triggered anyone or upset any body but I had to get this pressure off my chest. There's so much I want to say but Im not capable. This is as close as it gets. I don't need anyones  support or half assed reasons to stay alive or ""it'll get better"", ""it won't last forever"". Maybe I'll chooe to end it some day. Maybe I'll choose to stay who knows. All I know is ik just waiting for something to push me far enough to the point where there is no option left but to just fade away like everyone before me. The only thing I want is for people to treat me the exact same way they do when I die. I know that's impossible and I know most of the people I've ever known will milk my death and talk about how we were so close or how much they cared about me when it's the people who claim to care about me the most that have helped pushed me to the edge. When we die no one knows what happens. At least I don't know what happens. I hope it's just the end. No more dread, pain, regret, sadness, dissasociation, no more anything at all. 

Sorry for the long wall of text if anyone actually sees this. :/"
"I became violentI was pushed hard and I became violent. I punched my ex in the face twice and in the last instance she snapped her ACL. I ran away like a coward and am trying and failing to restart my life. My family has pumped the last of their resources into me, and I spent the last five days drinking getting ready to kill myself. I have been to rehab for alcohol 4 times, and been in a psych ward over 10 times. Iâve lost count. Iâm smart as fuck and nobody can reach me. I am fucking miserable. I have somehow managed not to kill anyone yet, but it feels like itâs only a matter of time. I need to kill myself before I hurt someone more than I already have."
"I want it all to be overIâve been depressed and see no way out, Iâve gotten therapy and taken medication and have been thinking positive thoughts but thatâs all bs and not helping at all. All I want to do is die Iâve written my suicide note, ended my friendships, made a will, and distanced myself from my entire family. Iâve thought long and hard about this and how I should go through with it and Iâve made peace with it. I forgave everyone whoâs ever hurt me and now Iâm ready to let myself finally be at peace. 

I know what Iâm doing is something not a lot of people will understand and struggle with. This in the end is my decision and Iâm so so so tired of fighting against it. Life has worn me down and broken me, so I want to leave while Iâm still happy while Iâm still a person because I fear that my humanity is slipping and that I will fall into a pit of depression worse then the one I am in now.  Goodbye to whoever sees this, I will miss it but I wonât regret leaving it all behind."

"Some people tell me I should commit suicideIt happened years ago. I sat on a bus with to the opposite of me a man and a woman. They were talking about the lessons they were making. At one point I think the woman referenced that she had a bad childhood. I said in myself rather loudly that it was a Freudian excuse. After that the woman asked me if I was German and started unironically comparing me to Hitler. After I apologized and started saying that I was suicidal she told me that she would be quite happy if I commited suicide. Now, to be fair, the man next to her even said that it's rare for someone to apologize and that I shouldn't listen to her, but it still stuck out to me in my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today. I told on a website that I consider myself to be a pedophile and said if I should commit suicide based on that fact alone. Someone responded by saying yes. After it I decided that I should commit suicide after I discussed it with my parents. After affirming to them that I didn't watch child porn nor raped a child but affirming that I do have pedophilic fantasies they told me that I should call the suicide hotline and that they'd discuss this with my psychiatrist. After it I agreed with them that the reason I thought about suicide is because I was due to fear of failure. I am afraid to fail and prefer to kill myself rather than to anticipate failure. I tried jumping out of a window when I was in 4th grade at high school because I failed to form a group with someone. I tried killing myself with a knife because I failed to keep my dad happy etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Still though. I now know of two people who've told me to kill myself. I really don't know what to do now. Yes, my parents and teachers want me to keep on living, but since I have seen two people who without any sense of irony told me to kill myself I'm confused on what to do now. "

"I'm not gay or nothing But I want a bro who's down just to suck each other off on occasion. Girls are too stressful sometimes, it's not gay, we're not attracted to each other, we'll just be helping each other out.

There'll be strict rules:

\-The guy most also be straight

\-No eye-contact

\-No ball-sucking

\-You can't place your hands on the other guys head

\-You have to swallow (spitting is gay)

\-Must be fresh out the shower

If that's considered gay, I don't know what to tell you. Any questions?"

"A song triggered me but i keep listening to itMy friend shot himself in the head in 2018. This sparked a huge curiosity into guns, bullets, and suicide by gun for me. I can read about it and not be bothered. But the song âPumped Up Kicksâ triggers the memory of my friend. It also triggers the picture of the columbine shooters dead in the library. i keep thinking of the photo and its fucking me up. i heard the song at around 4pm today, and while in the shower (around 10pm) i had a maladaptive daydream which was i think half an hour long. I just got out of another one, and this time is was around an hour long. 

My dad had to watch me like a hawk because i was talking and walking around. Iâm prone to walking into things, and even though he was watching me i ran into my bookshelf and took a chunk out of my nose. 

These thoughts of cutting and shooting myself and just giving up keep flooding my mind and i cant take it."
"Help me dictate my next moveHi Iâm 19 years old, I donât know what actually happened to me in a way, I mean sure I was bullied when I was young till I was 17, but at some point Iâm used to bullying, got a girlfriend when I was 18 just breaking up after something weird starting to happen to me;

I was questioning my life, questioning everything. That time I never felt lonelier and nothing I do is meaningful. I didnât have friends and was mostly lonely all the time, itâs seriously tiring and very suffocating. It feels so heavy to live and just continue to go on. I wanted more from life I think when I know life canât offer more. Iâll admit Iâm in no position to complain; my family is privileged (quite rich Iâd say), I signed a contract for a sponsorship when I was 17, and basically I have no reason to complain, but I still didnât feel happy at all, I feel miserable and all I do is spend my money on some stupid stuff just to seek for that random happiness, Iâve been fighting off my thoughts that tells me to just end it all for real and for good, I tried to hang myself a couple times, but I donât know whatâs stopping me.

Itâs been a year now, Iâm on medication 1.5 tablet of lexapro and 0.5 tablet of aripriprazole and am going to therapy, itâs been a year since but Iâm still not happy at all and I just wanna die. The feeling of being miserable, not belonging and the feeling of just not important is overwhelming me and I just wanna die, Iâll post this here and give myself 24 hours to let the Reddit community decide my next fate, Iâm so tired of fighting this off and all I get is some advice that I tried before like meditation and stuff but trust me it ainât helping, and the more I tried and it didnât help, the more I feel incurable and the more hopeless I feel. 

Haha cheers to the last 24 hours!"
"I'm still alive for a friendI have a friend who I recently met. She has had so many terrible things happen in her life. She has been raped, beaten by her family, psychologically tortured by her ex-boyfriend, has had most of her friends kill themselves, and has hallucination problems. 

Compared to me she has gone through hell. The only reason I'm still alive is I want to be there for her. Not romantically everything but as a close friend. It feels so selfish to want to kill myself when I have a perfectly good life."

"Living is so exhaustingI sometimes think about like oh Iâm going to get better or Iâm gonna feel better and that Iâm going to be okay but then I get pulled back into my default which is just. Constant depression and itâs so heavy and draining, being depressed literally makes being alive or functional a massive chore because you are constantly so drained, staying afloat is literally killing you and itâs horrifying. I keep on entertaining the idea of just ending it all as if my only point is just death, and the only time people will care is when Iâm dead. Iâm exhausted and no matter how many breaks I take, depression always rears its head. I find no enjoyment in life."

"Giving up on everything, i want to end my lifeEverything started with my family. When I went to middle school my only sister left the country for her boyfriend (she left 10 years ago, when i was only 11). By the way i have 4 more siblings that left our home earlier. I've never had a support by me, everything by my own. 

I have lost contact with a friend that got fired (the same job) because of alcohol. I called him many times but he didn't call back. We actually have met few times before he stopped responding to me. The last thing he said was:
""i will call you if i dont forget it"" - it was 3 months ago,  he just stabbed my knife, i did so much for him.
 I don't know what to do. I miss him so much, we had so many moments. I dont believe that he doesn't give a damn about me.

I've been drinking alot and actually trying marijuana to get rid off all the problems: family, work, stress, no time to do anything.
Now im feeling f****ng empty inside. dont really know what to do.

Friends? No thanks. (i deciline every person who wants to be on my ""friends"" list. I dont know how to talk to strangers.

Online games and alcohol make forget all the troubles.

I've benn feeling suicidal, want to hang myself to end my pain. No one will understand that. I have to hope, no friends, no future.

Just giving up on everying

(hanging myself is my solution ;/"
"I graduated cum laude with an engineering degree from a high ranked university in Dec 2018, and I've spent all of 2019 bedridden thanks to debilitating social anxiety and depression and I feel just giving up is the only choice I haveI was supposed to have been the 'golden child' of the family and make it big as a 1st generation college student. Ever since I was found out to be 'gifted,' that's what was pushed on me all throughout junior high, high school, and university. But instead of being my family's golden child, I'm left as a bitter disappointment as I've spent all of 2019 essentially in bed thanks to my unmanageable social anxiety that prevents me from operating as a normal person, something my family never bothered to address and they hoped I would 'grow' out of it. Well instead of growing out of it, it turned into a deeply rooted personality disorder that I struggle everyday with just to not kill myself. Don't get me wrong, my university had a counseling center and psychiatric services that I tried to make use of. I went through several different counselors, psychiatrists, and medications that I can't even remember the names of, but nothing helps when it's that far buried in you.

How well you do in University does not show how well you'll do in real life. I only ever did the minimum - study and homework. I didn't have friends. I didn't do extracurriculars, internships, or research. Any free time I had I spent laying in bed watching something on my phone. I haven't even sent out a single resume at all since graduating because all I have on it is that I went to college, and that I know that I'm too nonfunctional to even be an engineer, let alone getting past a fucking interview. I'm probably going to have to settle for something like working at the local dollar store because that's all I can see myself realistically doing and hopefully not fucking it up. Each day, that degree loses value to employers and it's probably going to be worthless. Some golden child I am. I'm a complete lost at what I should do other than giving up and dying."
TitleIs there anyone that i can just talk to please
"Plz help me with my math Can't post pics on this sub rn, so I'll post it on my profile"
"I am losing my fucking marbles so Iâm going to rantI want to start this by saying this not a bait and Iâm not fishing for attention by posting this I just really need to rant to calm myself down. Thanks ahead If you read all this, i know itâs going to be a lot. 

My dad always thinks when I talk about this shit, itâs just me bathing in self pity, like itâs just a way to get attention but itâs fucking not. Iâm slowly but surely going fucking insane. I know my dad thinks this is just an excuse for me to half ass being alive but I canât help it. Really Iâm trying, I even went to therapy and took all the meds they gave me but I really cannot see a point to keep trying if nothing is working. I was kind of getting better for a little. I was trying to avoid my triggers like certain people or situations but now Iâve found myself sheltered off from the real world. But this intense urge to kill myself keeps coming back no matter how hard I try. For a while I switched to the bottle as a desperate attempt to smother these intense impulses, but it was counter productive because I would end up just being miserable while i was drunk, which made suicide seem justifiable. All I can do now is get angry because at least when Iâm angry Iâm not sad. For at least 10 years all I would do is be sad. Iâm 17 now and when I was 7 my sister who was 9 at the time got molested in front of me by our baby sitters son and all I could do was feel ashamed in myself for not doing anything. All the while My mom would cry to me drunk out of her mind because my father left her. I had a little game I would play with her called âthe bird who says donât cryâ where I would just lean into her and say âdonât cry!â. Thatâs all I can think of now. All this shit that happened when i was so young keeps coming back and boiling into anger aimed in no particular direction. Talking about it helps but only so much. 

The only thing keeping me going is my family. My mom is a bipolar drug addict, my brother is just as angry at nothing as I am (plus heâs slowly but surely developing an extremely intense alcohol problem to try and cope with everything), my other brother is a recovering drug addict, and my sister is my best friend who has kept me going in some dark ass times. Sheâs too strong to tarnish for my own selfish reasoning, but i know sheâs got a lot sheâs repressing. My whole family is on the brink besides my dad who is happy to live in blissful ignorance to the situation. I canât throw them over board for myself. It wouldnât be fair. But god damn itâs getting hard to keep going. 

Thank you if you read this.

"this is getting tiresomeA few years ago something happened which changed my perspective on life in general.  At the time, I had no history of mental illness =. I have since gone from no diagnosis to a diagnosis of PTSD to atypical depression- with various other things mixed in.

Unfortunately, I feel a strong intermittent pull toward suicide since this incident.  It's hard to describe, but it is like I feel more than someone who is ""numb"", but less than someone who cares about anything.  

I have been in therapy and do not feel like I will ""act on"" my feelings again, however these feelings are really interfering with my quality of life.
Just curious if anyone else is dealing with a similar situation."

"Just gonna rambleI never felt suicidal until the summer of 2015. After I was sexually assaulted I was convinced I had HIV (I had mono three weeks later which mimics the symptoms of seroconversion exactly). I hated myself for putting myself in a position that could wreck my life. I quit seeing my family and going to train martial arts because I was scared I would accidentally infect someone (you're most infectious the first 6 weeks).

After looking up the cost and terrible side affects of the HIV meds, I realized I could never burden someone with a relationship if I was positive. So I broke it off with the guy I was falling for and decided if I was positive suicude was the only option. This horrified me because I loved being alive and my self hatred reached new levels, since I blamed myself for what happened. 

I cried all day every day for weeks alone. I tried going to a few clinics for help but they were only interested in helping homosexuals psychologically. I was too afraid and ashamed to report the assault for many reasons so I didn't get help.

After I finally tested definitely negative I thought I would feel relieved and grateful. But nothing got better. Ive been alone and unable to function since. A lot of really horrible things also happened to me in mental hospitals and stuff. I lost my dog and the abusive guy I dated stole over 10k from me.

At some point I fixated on suicide again. The constant fear of death was gone and the PTSD lifted. I stopped having panic attacks and nightmares. But if I start feeling a desire to live again, I am overwhelmed with grief, terror and grief at everything I have lost and how evil some people are. I feel like if I ever found a smidgen of happiness it will be taken from me or used against me. The person I was a year ago gone. I'm not a person anymore. I've been dead for a very long time already."

"The fragile boys of my old highschool There were a couple of guys at my old highschool who were very hypocrite and annoying. They liked to hit and squeeze people in their necks with their cold and wet fingers, so one break I had enough of being hit in my neck or one of my friends getting her neck squeezed so I hid myself between some sophomores and started moving my hand around the bicep of one of those guys (Damn actually ð) and because of that they started gossiping about that was somehow in love with him and they started giving me a disgusted look.

i got  denied for disability because i need more of a ""paper trail"" but i have absolutely no income so i cant really afford 3-4 monthes of psychiatrists saying the same shit theyve been saying since i was a teen, but apparently stuff from when youre younger just isnt good enough i guess? even though ive got a psychosis diagnosis going back to 11 years old and a schizophrenia diagnosis from like 17 onwards

my mom is trying my patience for lack of a better term. shes been either abusing me or ignoring me basically as long as i can remember, and its been downhill ever since my grandma died. she was my rock and i truly think i died with her and that im not real but i wont go too far into that kind of shit because im embarrassed of my mental illness and delusions. im ashamed of being this way. i wish i was just normal and could work a job i hate but i cant even leave my house . i relapsed self harm and its all i can think about anymore, just a way to have a SHRED of control over my life at almost 22 fuckin years old. i feel so pathetic. it really feels like this world really just doesnt care about low income people, let alone low income mentally ill people and im so tired of trying to fight for below the bare minimum

ive never had a want for a future before, but i want one now, and i feel like i destroyed my chances when i was a teenager. its heartbreaking to look back and think of all i could have done different and look now and not be able to find options other than waiting. its hard to wait when thats all youve been doing and you feel like youre in a shrinking cage with no way out every time you take a breath"
"No desire seems worth itToday I have only been confronted with the BS in this world. The struggles of trying to sustain yourself, the cruelties of the political system. And then you just wonder do I want to go through that. I'm still in high school, I am far from being able to claim I've really struggled, really been at the bottom. Yet, even at this stage I cannot grasp why I want to go through with it all. That combined with the occasional demon of self-hate peeking its head now and again, which recently really go to me and had me believe I would end it that day. Usually I would just vent or ask for help on discord, but I can't speak of this to my friends there they too are fighting. Being all down might pull them with me. Doing it anywhere else on discord I know I""ll get the messages I've read before: ""contact a hotline"" I can't do that. There is so little I can do, not because I am physically incapable to. But just because of me, this weak spirit. It's so weak I can't do simple tasks without forsaking everything. I am useless. And they only way for that to change is to not be stuck like this. But do I want to be able to do things? Is wanting anything even worth it? I just know I'm disregarding a lot of things but everything feels so closed down on me. Naturally I am the problem."

Maybe in 50 years it'll be a non-issue, but there's no way I'm going through those years waiting for total acceptance. 

 I'm going to be dead soon. I've decided. I'm going to give the world and the universe what it wants. I regret all of the money my parents and family have wasted on me throughout my 17 years of living. All of the food, clothes, and hospital visits for all of my mental disorders. They'll probably be sad at first, but they'll be able to invest their money into better things like retirement, more free time, and my mother's health. I wish that it didn't have to be this way, but I'd like to spare my family the disappointment before I turn 18 and have to do shit I'm just not capable of doing. I'm sure the people of the world will be happy knowing one less trans person is alive. I'm happy to oblige them. 

Anyway, thanks for listening, or not. Sorry to be such a downer. I don't know if I'm here to get help, but I just want somebody to listen."

Why am I still hereI've dealt with addiction for about four years now I've been battling depression for almost 6 years but I've been afraid to get help. Idk why I am still on this earth and it seems that every few months I get serious depression and suicidal thoughts. I don't know what to do and even things that generally made me happy in the past don't make me feel any different anymore. I've tried to set myself on a straight path but every time I let myself down and relapse. I don't want to hurt anyone else so I just keep to myself and don't even go out anymore but I'm not sure how much longer I can go on like this.
"Can I talk to someone?Hello, I know I posted here 4 days ago, but for some reason I canât access the comments on my post, so I decided to post again. Well, as the title implies, I would highly appreciate it if someone with an open mind is willing to talk to me. I would like to talk about some personal issues I have, including the question I asked in my previous post, which is how to commit suicide. I really hope someone will be kind enough to spare some time to talk to me because a lot of stuff thatâs happening in my life is driving me crazy already. Thank you."
Would it still be suicide if you choose to die by voluntary dehydration?I don't need to list reasons why I'm considering. That's just not relevant to my question. I don't need someone to tell me all the reasons I should keep fighting and keep going because I don't want that. I don't want to keep going.

"Reminder: You're still here, which means you're doing something right in my book.Life is difficult: it doesn't give much of anything freely -- of the things it does give freely, few of them are worth having.

I know life isn't fair and I'm sorry it isn't, but when you feel like you're worthless and you're doing nothing right... remember: you're still alive.

I don't care what excuse you give as to why you still being here isn't an accomplishment, I don't care what you say as to why your life isn't valuable, you're wrong.

You haven't ""logged off"", you haven't ""quit"", you're still trying even if it is by default -- and that's a win in my book.

If you need someone to talk to: PM me, or let someone on this sub know, or find a different sub that will help.

You're still here, which means you still have the potential to turn everything around and make life worth living.

I tried to kill myself at 18 and failed, rehab sucked, the meds were the worst part for me, but now at 35 I'm not only happy to be alive but I've had so many people thank me for being alive *for them*.

**You are not worthless**, and if you don't believe me: PM me, I'll be happy to debate with your self-loathing as to why you are worth something."

and then what. Unloading my problems on other people wont change anything. Talking to a stranger wont help my financial or relationship issues. Talking to friends or family wont help, they all have enough shit in their lives, without me adding the pile.

Why would I do that to other people. load all my crap on them? They cant change it, and then have them looking at me with pity? feeling sorry for me. Yeah, just what I need.

2)Play several insturments
3)Technology loves me and I love it
4) Have an athletic body (but I dont play sports)
5) intermediate level archer

But do all those things keep me from living? No. Its my family. If I do kill myself (which I really want to do) My sister and mom and step dad and even my closest friends wouldnt be right in the head anymore. I cant do that to them..

So im waiting. Im waiting til I get older and be able to honestly make my decisions. I dont know how im going to take myself out but im going to do it thats no doubt. Ive already tried 4 times and the feelings is like a rush of adrenaline that never leaves your body! And that feeling is amazing. When I get older im going to have that feeling again, then never have it again.

So say what you want I might take it into consideration and dont tell me how it will affect my friends and family. I already talked to my closest friends and they arent right in the head when it comes to these things. HELL! One of my friends said they wouldnt mind doing it with me! Shows how strong my generations will to live is...

Im 16 and been thinking about killing myself for 5 years... I dont think anything could stop me once I get to that point..."

I'm 22 years old and fairly attractive . My first relationship failed but I thought I'll find someone better . Then I briefly dated a friend who dumped me before new year this year . Then i was ghosted by an online date but that didn't bother me at all . So, this guy I knew from my past reappeared in my life and we started dating but he ghosted me . 

And i feel particularly bad because we know each other and he just disappeared and wouldn't take my calls , wouldn't see my texts. I deleted his number and blocked him.  At first i felt happy and relieved but then a heavy fog of sadness lingered over me and now I wish I could end it all .

I feel utterly hopeless and sad and I'm very much bothered that out of all ppl he decided to ghost me . We were more than lovers , he could've have just said he didn't want to date me anymore but instead he just disappeared from my life . 

I can't seem to find anything that would comfort me and I am in extreme distress ."

I mean. 
Age
5-12 Physical, verbal bullying and social isolation
13-15 Social isolation. Something started in my head.
16-18 Domestic abuse and an enabler who kept telling me my abuser loves me. Social isolation. Homophobia. Video gaming addiction took root.
18-now Went abroad struggling with language barriers. Gaming addiction currently screwing with me. Social isolation ceased entirely.


I'm not struggling in any way. Financially it can be better but I think I'm well off to some extent. But I'm so nervous. It's hard enough to go to a doctor. And I get sick rather often. Health wise, it's much better nowadays though. I used to get sick nearly all the time, and it's all pretty major stuff.

I'm nervous. I want to sleep. Class is tomorrow. But negative thoughts are swirling in. I don't want to sleep. I don't want to face tomorrow. 

...I still don't get why my SO insists he loves me. My self esteem plummeted and doubt has taken root. ... Though I need to remind myself, I feel much better when I'm not playing games nonstop, either.

"Lost my cousin yesterday to suicide. Have some questions about the difference between ideation and intent.I lost my cousin to suicide yesterday. I wasn't aware that he had been having any issues that might lead to this, but I guess I wasn't close enough to really know. I cared for him a lot though. He was a good guy, especially towards me. 

That having been said, I've had a lot of suicidal ideation throughout my entire life. Like, as far back as I can remember. At one point, a few months ago, I had been seeing a therapist at my college's Behavioral Medicine center (which was free), but once I graduated in December, that ended, so I haven't been on any antidepressants since then. I've only ever gone on them for those maybe 3 months, but they were a massive help. To be honest, I didn't think I needed them as badly since the stress of school was gone, and I didn't have the giant issues of living with my family like when I was a kid. 

Any way, the point is, that therapist had asked me if I had any plans to actually kill myself. I told her no, which was mostly true. But her asking me that, of course, prompted me to think ""If I were to do it, specifically how would I?"" I had dumb plans when I was a kid about jumping out a window that I was too afraid to go through with, and now I know how I'd do it if I were to.
I want to know if that crosses the line past suicidal ideation into intent. Like, I don't have any plans to go through with it at any time, I just know how I'd do it if I was ever driven to that point.

tl:dr: is having an idea of how you would kill yourself if you ever got to that point intent, or still in the range of ideation?"

And no, ""think about the happiness you can have"" isn't a good argument because I can literally end my life now and happiness and sadness will both be irrelevant rather than going through sadness hoping for some dismally small amount of ""happiness"" that may or may not exist, may or may not satisfy me, and even if it does, it'll be like a piece of moldy bread thrown at me after I've been starving for days."

Just another miserable asshole M/22I know I'm not unique I know I'm not special. I'm A 22 year-old Virgin. I kissed a girl once and actually got the third-base on her it was pretty cool. That was three years ago though and I don't see it happening again. I was too scared to leave the house today.both my roommates left for the weekend. I haven't been to the gym in months. Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror and I think I'm handsome guy. Last year I thought I was gay for a little bit but I think that's because I was just so lonely. I start talking to a guy on grinder but then when he asked to meet I got nervous and deleted the app. Sometimes I look at gay porn but not very often. I don't think my roommates would understand. My sister tried to kill her self a couple months ago. She's turning 27 next month. She lives with my mom and quit her job right after she tried to kill her self. She just got a job at Walmart two weeks ago and recently quit. My mom has to go with her to her doctors appointments. I haven't seen my dad in three years. I should call him more often. I have talk to him one time since Christmas and it did not talk to him on Christmas. I dropped out of high school and have very bad handwriting. I'm really self-conscious about it. When I was 18 years old I weighed almost 400 poundsmy mom bought me a treadmill and I ran on it every day. I stopped writing this note to order a pizza there's something funny about that. It's not a matter if I'm going to kill myself but when. My mom and sister are extremely overweight and one of them as suicidal tendencies. I'll probably do it after they die. I see three possibilities for my life. 1. I meet a girl (or guy) who'll sleep with me have a couple of kids be broke for the rest of my life kids grow to resent me I've become an alcoholic.this is the least likely and happiest choice. 2. I Stay employed to the job I don't like get an apartment by myself and basically do what I'm doing tonight for the rest of my life: become a shut in who doesn't talk to people in orders delivery food with social Security money. 3. Kill myself.
"Sister has tried to kill herself three times now that I know of, I just don't know what to do.The first time she tried I was away at university, it was a secret kept from me for over a month and it tore me up that I didn't even know until my family told me, late.

Fast forward a year and now I'm home, she tried again this Sunday when I was over at my girlfriend's and I just didn't know what to do. We hadn't spoken in a while and I didn't know she was upset.

Yesterday night my parents went out 'for a trip' when I was with some friends, she had done it again. I have no idea what to do.

At this point it seems like if we've had 2 days of good positive steps for her to regress back to this then she's lost. I am feeling so jaded from this, I don't know what to do. She's been in hospital all day today and I just don't know what to do.It's all to do with a jerky guy that has moved on from her, she's had bad relationships before and he was equally as bad a person, manipulative and nasty. But since this time we went out for drinks and actually had a laugh, we've joked and hugged and have been relatively normal siblings. My parents are falling apart, they found a letter today addressed to us, it clearly was supposed to be found if she had successfully committed suicide.

I'm angry, confused, I feel emotionally cold and exhausted. I need any advice you can give right now because I'm either never going to forgive myself as a result or the world around me will shatter."
"why am i like this why do i catch feelings for people so quickly

ive only been friends with this girl for a few weeks and i already have feelings for her wtf

whyyyyyy"
"Iâm A Fu*king Idiot For Thinking Iâm Actually Worth Something... (tw: depression, suicide, dysphoria, family issues, etc).I'm fucking stupid if I think transitioning (Iâm Male to Female Transgender) is gonna stop me from being anything but a boring, friendless, hollow piece of shit.

I'm never anyone's first choice.

I'm either ""you'll do"", ""I need something from you"", â2nd or 3rd choice"", or ""sure I'll take your money and pretend to give a fuck about you"". 

Life is gonna find a way to deny me HRT, I just know it.

It seems to absolutely love getting me excited about something only to yoink it away last second.

Anything fun, productive, rewarding, enriching, educational.

I don't deserve it.

I donât even have control over the temperature in my own apartment (central boiler radiant heat). 

Iâm completely at everyoneâs mercy for almost everything. 

The only thing I deserve is to work full time then go home to a 15x20 concrete cell and lay in bed and stare at the ceiling, looking forward to going back to work in the morning cause that's the only human interaction I ever get unless someone needs something from me.

I call myself a dj but it's been almost 2 years since my last gig.

I've had to sell 2 vehicles at a loss because of reasons I could have easily repaired myself, but they both broke down in the winter and I didn't have so much as a parking spot to park it in till the spring when I could work on it myself.

I get jealous of people talking about doing yard work and planting gardens.

People with workshops where they can build and create.

Somewhere to work out.

I can't even get fresh air without stepping out of my apartment building.

I don't have so much as a fucking hamster to look forward to at the end of the day.

I couldnât even keep a fucking cat alive, what makes me think I deserve comfort and companionship?

I don't have anyone to eat meals with.

I don't have friends that I hang out with more than every few months.

I don't get invited anywhere.

Even before covid.

I've only ever had one genuine relationship that didn't involve getting cheated on or getting taken advantage of.

I've never had a repeat sexual relationship with anyone, and no one that wasn't multiple times my age.

I've always been a pathetic human.

Itâs been a 29 year rut and at this point this list of things I've had to resign myself to never going to happen is longer than both the list of things I've done and the list of things I still have a possibility of crossing off, combined.

Iâve lived my life listening to my parents.

Now my moms dead and Iâm a failure in my dads eyes. 

I want to sew.

I want to work on my vehicle.

(I have to get one again first).

I want to tend a garden.

I want to maintain a yard.

I want to DJ.

I want to have someone to cook for and to cook for me.

I want something... someone... to look forward to going home to.

But:

I don't have the space to set up a sewing machine.

I don't have a vehicle anymore, let alone somewhere to work on it.

I don't have a yard or a garden.

I can't even get fresh air without getting ready and leaving my building.

I haven't had a gig in almost 2 years. 

Even before covid I only managed to have people over at most once a month or two.

I could be homeless and 99% of people would never know. 

The only gay bar in town isn't a safe place for me since new management took over in 2017 and went right to work pushing me out after working there for 5 years, and making it perfectly clear in no uncertain terms that I was neither wanted nor welcome around there. 

I've been trying to get out of this city for years.

Hell, I only intended to stay here a year at most.

That was 2013.

I don't even have a vehicle anymore. 

My dad has proven himself to be a total piece of shit that I don't trust anymore, even without him finding out Iâm trans.

Heâs disappointed enough that Iâm bi/pan.

He makes no effort to hide his disappointment.

Which means I'm gonna have to take a match to everything but what I can carry on my back and walk away from this shithole of a city and never look back.

I donât want to have to keep in contact with him once he finds out Iâm trans just for the sake of coming back to get my stuff some day. 

Anxiety has been running wild today.

Another Friday with nothing to look forward to but coming back to work on Monday morning, knowing I've got 2 days of solitary confinement to look forward to.

I can't keep this up.

Even the weed has stopped working for me.

9/10 times I get absolutely nothing from it anymore.

I'm so fucking tired of hearing ""it gets better"" cause it just keeps finding new ways to get worse.

Just when I think I've lost everything I could possibly lose, life finds a way to strip something else away from me.

""It gets better"" is fucking bullshit.

Even before covid my sanity was hanging on by a thread. 

Now I canât go sit at the far end of the bar and pretend that anyone in the bar would give a rats ass if I was alive or dead. 

I canât go loitering at malls and thrift stores (charity shops) to spend money just so I can have the cashier to tell me to âhave a nice dayâ cause itâs the only way I get to hear it, but I know ultimately itâs just business and they say that to everyone... 

Iâm trying to hold on, but Iâm running out of things to grasp onto.

Iâve stopped caring. 

Iâve stopped looking both ways before crossing the street.

Iâve stopped texting first cause all I ever get is left on read.

Iâm a fucking moron if I think HRT is going to make me like myself any more.

Thereâs no saving me anymore.

The best I deserve is a slow, painful death.

Not even the courtesy of quick and painless. 

Oh... wait..."

"My suicidal ex won't stop messaging me about how she's going to kill herself.Some of you may have seen my post from before where I went into detail about my suicidal girlfriend. Since then, we have gotten into a giant argument that ended up with me being arrested. After that fight, we broke up. This happened about a week ago and everyday since she has been texting me saying how she wants to kill herself and how it's all my fault. I broke up with her in hopes that we could both be independent and find help to become better, healthier people. While I am still trying to do those things, she is just making me feel a whole lot worse at every turn. She constantly blows my phone up with things like ""hope you don't bring girls to my funeral"" and ""I'm gonna start writing suicide notes"" and it has left me in the worst situation yet. I am trying so hard to focus my energy on bettering myself but it seems she only wants me to feel as worse as possible. All I want is for her not to kill herself. But I can't fall back into the trap that was our relationship. ANY advice is appreciated. She is trying to ruin my progress which I'm scared will lead to me becoming suicidal."
"I've thought about it.Im young, 14 years old and I feel like life already hates me. Im asian, and of course my parents want me to ""be the best"" and ""get straight A's"" but i don't care about that. I want to enjoy my life, follow my passion (animation) and hang out with mu friends. Life wasn't the best but then it happened. On the last day of Thanksgiving break, my mom pulled me over and told me my Dad was doing drugs. To some people this might not be much, but in the place i live in, smoking is uncommon. When I was told this, it hit me like a bullet. I didn't know how to feel but my mom just said ""we need to encourage him to get out of the bad habit"". This went on for about 2 months before my dad said something - he wanted a divorce. Later we found him doing drugs in our house and my mom kicked him out. I really don't know what to think. On top of this shit i get bullied at school. Every day someone flips my lock, and people call me a faggot. I don't know what to do, what to think. I've considered suicide but I just don't know. Please. Help me."

"Don't want to carry on.Feel like a spoiled child with that title but it is what it is. I'll attempt to be as brief as I can.

Failing uni and I'm not sure I care about my degree (music) anyway. I have a close friend who usually helps with these things but I haven't had a response from them. They mean the world to me, but when they are late to respond I start freaking out about how much I trust them etc. There are valid reasons but that story is way too long to be telling here. Point is we've patched things up since all the drama in the past, and since then I've lost it at them for what turned out to be nothing before so I'm posting here instead. I'd really rather not make that mistake again.

Basically I'm dead weight and I have no hope for the future. I've dragged myself on to not hurt others but I'm really questioning the point in continuing. Do I ever get to say 'right, I tried, can I give up now?'

No, obviously I don't. You have to live with it to keep everyone else happy. I can hear (see?) it now: 'suicide is never the answer...'"
Question for the boys Would u want to get pegged by a girl? Just curious how many of u r into that.
"i relapsed, and i'm scaredover the past few years, i've made strides in therapy and personal growth and learning how to cope with my depression/anxiety. i even worked up the courage to estrange from my narcissistic mother.

i went from thinking about killing myself multiple times a day to thinking of it maybe once a week.. and lately, all of those thoughts have just flooded back in.

because this year is the fucking worst. america is the fucking worst. i was supposed to graduate college, move out of this hellhole state, and experience some ounce of freedom for once in my life. and now i just feel fucking stuck. i don't think i have the motivation or the strength to fight this anymore. i sense my expiration date is nearing soon."
"My latest philosophy.. Dont hate people. Whether you hate a racist, sexist, misandrist, misogynist, rapist, murderer, or anybody else. You hate them for their ignorance. 

The racist may genuinely that he isnt a bad person. He believes that he's the good one. He may genuinely believe that black people are inherently bad. While this isnt true, why does he believe it? His environment. His environment shaped him to how is is today. What he's learned from the media, his parents, his encounters with black people, ect. He isnt in control of his environment. It's not his fault that he's racist. If he wouldve grown up in a different family, he probably wouldn't of been racist. It has nothing to do with his brain, and everything to do with his environment. Racism isn't inherent. Its ignorance that's taught. Something you have no control over being taught. Because you lack perspective. If you had that real perspective and yet you still grew up in that environment, you would choose to not be racist. Most people dont understand how shaped we are by our environments. All of our thoughts. All of our descions. Our life choices. They stemmed from our environment. An environment we didnt choose. It's not our fault that we have those thoughts. So noone should hate us for them. At the least, they should feel sorry for is. At the most, they should try their best to educate us. Once you realize this, that people are products of their environments. That who they are isnt their fault. All of the hate you have will leave your heart. 

Now, this isnt to say that you should just handle every situation with a bad person like ""i'm better than you,"" so you're still feeling good at the end of the day. That's an ego problem. Another issue for another time. 

And this doesnt mean that you aren't responsible for making strides to change your life. To become better. To change your environment. This isnt a free pass to just be an uncrafted person. Yes, you have to hit the perfect and exact pillars (bits of knowledge) in order to want to change your life and actually do it. Whether you get those or not is entirely based on your environment. But truthfully you probably have pieces of those pillars already, most people do. This post isnt meant for you to disregard those pillars and just stay how you are. If anything, its meant to encourage you to do the opposite. Push and change to become better. Go for it. Stop hating people. Theres no valid reason to."

"Something miraculous (or merely a coincidence) just happened, so I decide to stick around for a while.Earlier today I was filled with desperation and pretty determined that I must hang myself before midnight because all the worst things I can't handle comes to me all at once -- a big fight bwtween my toxic parents, mother's raging and screaming hurting my brain and nerves, drunk af father kept verbally abusing me all night, school sended a message that I'm about to get kicked out.
When I was searching on the youtube for the songs I'm going to listen to during hanging, I found that the MIT professor Gilbert Strang's newest course has just been uploaded about half an hour ago. I'm a big fan of him. Doesn't make me any less suicidal at all, but still feel like to finish all these lecture videos before death. So that's something what just happened."

"I need help.I need help.  Iâve had depression issues since I was a child.  I had things happen during my childhood that I just canât bring myself to talk about out loud.  My father died a few years ago after a lifetime of cheating, lying, and doing terrible things to my mom and two sisters and myself.  Ever since he died I have had more and more bad memories coming out of the dark.  I just canât handle any more.  

My husband and I both work but we just canât get ahead.  I feel guilty for just existing, eating, being.  I have cried every day since November 2017.  Things have always been rough but holidays are awful, as yâall know.  But now itâs March and I still canât bear to face the day. 

My husband is wonderful.  He doesnât have a clue how bad off I am.  He has no idea I daydream about suicide.  He doesnât know most of what happened when I was young.  No one does.  I cover my sadness with fake smiles, and laughs.  I hate to bother anyone.  

Any of my friends, family, would be so shocked to hear this.  I put on an excellent smiley, happy front.  Iâm really, really good at acting like everything is great.  I force myself to complete the daily interactions needed of me.  Take the kiddo to school, Iâm a PTA mom, head of class parties, the âsoccer momâ that has it together, but Iâm honestly dying inside.  But my heart absolutely hurts.  I feel so broken with sadness.  

I need meds, I know I do, but itâs $200 just for an office visit at the local urgent care.  I canât bring myself to use two hundred bucks on myself.  I want to run far away and just be done but I canât do that to my child and my husband, so instead I sit here with more grief and sadness than I know what to do with.  

Thanks for reading.  If I did it, I would jump.  Jump and drown.  "

"I just want to be told I did the right thing.I checked myself into the emergency room yesterday because I didnât think Iâd be able to pull myself back from the edge on my own again. It was incredibly difficult for me to do. I still feel so ashamed and vulnerable. My friend had to drive me there and miss work for several minutes to do so because I lost my keys, and Iâm so grateful to him, but Iâm scared that heâs exhausted from having to listen to me so often these past few weeks. Iâm afraid when he reassures me Iâm not a burden that heâs just lying so I donât kill myself. 

My family is making it about themselves and I feel so raw and naked from taking the steps I did and Iâm terrified that I did the wrong thing. Im having a hard time stopping myself from thinking I should have just not said anything about the danger I was in and gone through with it. 

Iâm so scared that Iâve fucked up everything for myself by trying to get help and I know itâs not rational but I canât stop myself from feeling that way. 

Nobody seems to understand how hard it was to make that decision to live. I did it for them, I did it so they wouldnât *have* to deal with the grief of losing me. So many people have been treating me like a cornered animal and the worst part is that theyâre probably right to. I feel so shaky and so alone."
"Why I'm hereA few days ago I called the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. I was connected with a very nice lady that asked me a few key questions at the very beginning of our conversation. She immediately wanted to know if I was planning to end my life that moment and if I had a means to do so, like if I had a gun with me or something. I told her no that I was just sitting in my car. She then asked me on a scale from 1 to 10 how do I feel about hurting myself within the hour, 10 being the highest and obviously one being the lowest. At that particular time I was feeling like a 7 but I still had control to some degree over my emotional state. About that time I heard a ring on her side and she told me to hold on one moment as she answered the phone and if I could please wait. I told her sure. I waited a few minutes and she came back and apologize for the wait. I told her it was fine. She asked me if I ever tried to commit suicide in the past I told her once when I was younger around 15. At this particular time I felt like there's no point in trying to hide anything considering I was feeling like ending everything so honesty was basically the only way I was going to say anything. After I told her that she had another phone call and had to put me on hold again and apologized. I did kind of wonder if she was kind of working alone since she was interrupted twice within the span of maybe 10 minutes or so. Totally not her fault I was just surprised that she didn't have more help. When she got back to me a few minutes later she apologized and I told her it was completely fine. For some reason I felt like I had all the patience in the world, I still can't figure that out. She asked me if I had anyone I could talk to or some kind of support group. I told her no I did not. And this is why I am here on Reddit. She told me that I might be able to find some encouragement or a support group here on Reddit. This is my very first post. I've never used reddit before. To be honest I'm still not exactly sure what this is but I decided to at least post this. I would like to make a quick comment about the National Suicide Prevention hotline, the lady I spoke to was very nice and at the end of our conversation though it was interrupted a few times at least gave me a few minutes to think rationally without extreme emotion. For what it's worth it got me here to post this."
I miss studying at the library I love my desk but the library hit different
"This is probably pointless to even post...I have been depressed for the last four years. (I'm 17) I'm not talking about the teenage depression, I've tried several times to take my own life. I've either pussied out, or I didn't succeed in it.

The reason that I've been so depressed lately is because of a girl. (I met her over the internet)Shes my dream girl. Long curly brown hair, the most stunning look in her eyes, amazing smile, extremely soothing voice, and a personality just as unbelievable. We hit it off great, talking as much as we could, video chatting, phone convorsations, everything. We decided that we should meet up. I busted my ass to get the money to see her, and on the day before I was supposed to go up there, she calls it off. I was devistated to say the least. I did all of that work, all of the planning to meet the girl of my dreams just to have her call it off the day before.

A month of depression slowly creeps by of no contact between us (our phones were messing up and didn't know it)until around five days ago she messages me on Skype again. We IM'd for a while and then got off. Yesterday we got on the cam again until five in the morning until she fell asleep talking to me. I got to thinking about how easy it is to lose her again. Being long distance, all she has to do is stop talking to me and it would be over.

What really drove me over the edge was something that she brought up last night. She told me that a couple of days before we started talking again she met up with some random guy. Normally this wouldn't seem like a big deal to anybody else, but its a sore subject with us. She knows that I get jealous really easily and told me that she wouldn't really talk about to with me bcause of that. She told me that the first time that we talked because we had a thing going. After she told me about it, it made me realize that I had been friendzoned. That has depressed me sooo much that I feel like I can't take it anymore. I already have a suicide plan and I'm going to write a short but meaningful suicide note to her and a couple of other people. All I'm waiting for is the gears to be set into motion.

I apologize in advance if this is hard to follow, I can't really think straight right now and my thoughts are scattered."
"Can we for once look at what we can try for our situation?Don't get me wrong, I really want to die too and when I'm at my lowest, all I want to do is just get out of this whole reality but I also happened to be one of those people who are procrastinating on killing myself.

This subreddit is great to rant or let out those feelings but can we for once talk about suggestions on how to make baby steps? It's not possible to get out of this mental rut but I think we as a community understands the struggle best and it would be good to know what worked and how we can learn from those who tried. 

I know people who doesn't understand what we experience make dumb statements like ""call the hot line"" or ""just do it, why cant you just do it"" but I don't expect them to understand either. It's not on them for being wired differently just like how it's not on us to not have the ability to function the same way normal people do."

"The Wild (Suicide Note)The Wild

In the wild, there is a system, a hierarchy. In the wild there are politics, there are economics, there are social groups, there are families, and there is a food chain. In the wild we can see that everything is divided in groups, there are states, counties and borders that should not be crossed. Every animal group has their own system or way of doing things, elephants for example have a matriarch system, there is a chief elephant that leads their herd, there are family groups composed of moms, dads, sons, daughters and even uncles. They have social groups within the herd. When a link between the elephants is broken or one of the elephant dies, the other elephants mourn  their lost or their break-up. We can also see systems in other animals like lions. Not that the DisneyÂ® movie âThe Lion Kingâ is entirely true, but there is some true to some of the behaviors seen in the movie. Like the alpha male being the king and the leader, this behavior is really seen in the wild. The females hunt and the male sits all day guarding the âhouseâ. These animals are intelligent enough to create hierarchies and to assign roles. There are multiple examples of systems in the wild, but what about humans, what about our systems, our politics, our economy, our social groups. How do we reflect the close to perfect systems that the âlowerâ species develop. There is a factor that limits our development process of successful systems. Betrayalâ¦ In the wild, it is very rare to see same species animals betray their own kin. But among humans this is a really dominant factor, in politics, in economy and other âeffective systemsâ that we've created. We see betrayal when a politician promises change, but delivers misery and poverty to his people. We see betrayal in economy when a person that makes (apparently) not enough money to survive this terrible life, steals from the poor to satisfy his own greedy and vicious needs. We see betrayal in our social development and social groups. Before we are born we could easily be betrayed by our mother who chose to abort because her life is a miserable piece of crap and a baby wont make it any better. But if you do get the chance to be born, you get betrayed on every single step of your life, no matter how much you learn about life and its evil ways, youâll get betrayed by the one you call brother, the one you call friend and sometimes even the one you donât call anything because you donât even know them. Thatâs how FUCKED UP this world is. You get betrayed when you fall in love, you get betrayed when you think out load, when you speak, when you dream, in fact when you do ANYTHING, you are sure to get betrayed. You may ask yourself, â why is this happening to me?â and trust me, eventually you'll realize that nothing in this god damned world is worth it. Nothing is worth it, not knowledge, not being popular or famous, not being rich, not being the pretties or cutest person in the world, NOTHING and I repeat NOTHING is worth it. Because as all the other animals in the wild all humans really need, other than food, sleep, and a well given bath, is love. Every animal no matter what the species is needs love. We all need a special someone. But just imagine how screwed up the world is that we prefer to betray our friends, family, and sometimes even ourselves to make someone elseâs life a living hell, and you know you've gone your way at some point in your life to make someone miserable. This is something we don't see in the wild because animals understand the commitment and the responsibility that comes with living in this world and enjoying your stay in this shit hole while it lasts. We also don't see this shitty behavior in the wild because animals don't have the mental capacity to hate, they don't have the mental capacity to betray or to backstab their friends. If there is one thing I've learned from life experiences is to not befriend anyone, just smile and wave, or just learn their names and call them by that because humans are so vain that they love listening to their own name (narcissistic sonâs of bitches that we are huh). So thats one of the things I've learned, but like I said this means nothing, absolutely nothing is worth anything in this nickel back piece of crap world. I know I may seem rude or just seem like an ass, but thats what you get when you go into the wild. You learn to survive and eat every single being that crosses your path. A few days ago I came up with the phrase âLetâs do it!â, what I really meant to say was lets not do anything and lets just sit here and do nothing until death proclaims our miserable bodies, because I feel like this life is less shitty when you just do nothing. Why because you canât hurt or get hurt, and people say that pain makes us growâ¦ Well guess what that is the biggest pile of bull shit I've ever heard. Human beings did not evolve for 8 million years to live in pain. We evolved because there were some basic necessities that we needed to take care of and that caused changes in the human body to adapt our physical nature to nature itself. What I really hate is when people say that love is not a relevant thingâ¦ Okayâ¦ Okayâ¦ Letâs see how you handle everyone rejecting you and not being able to love. Youâll go fucking nuts in less than a few hours, specially in this society where our emotions and our souls are driven by Facebook and twitter. To be a little more practical, start a Facebook profile, get tons of likes and then close your accountâ¦ You'll come back to the computer screen like a love searching moth in the dark. We are love whores, we need love, we need it so much that when your family abandons you, your friends become the filthiest assholes in the universe, and your dog doesnât want you to pet him, we turn to God for a loving handâ¦ Could you be a bit less stupid please, God loves you and he loves everyone but the kind of love that humans need is not the love of an invisible being that created the world and humans themselves. Humans need the word, and no im not talking about the bible. Im talking about the literal word âLoveâ. Why do I say thisâ¦ well growing up with a mom that worked all day and a step dad that had a love-hate relationship with me, sometimes all I needed was a word, a word used in the context of the famous phrase âI Love Youâ, and don't tell me that you don't like hearing those words together. I just wish I would have been given the opportunity to choose between a wealthy life and the love of a mother. I didn't really ever feel that so I don't know what love is. Ive been in multiple relationships, all of which failed miserably because I don't know how to love and my attitude is shit. A lot of people suffer from shitty attitude syndrome, which is basically being an asshole, and only enough some maleâs and femaleâs across the globe fall for this kind of behavior because they think its attractive, well its not and all the people who like these bad attitudes are stupid and should be put in a mental institution to get some serious treatments. But this attraction is not always our fault, because the fault is definitely in our stars, the fault is in out way of thinking about other people. For example, I used to think my stage manager for the traveling theatre group in college was cute, and I was filled with joy every time I saw her face or talked to her, but then came the betrayal, she liked my friend, and even though I wasn't completely satisfied with this I decided to pursue the dream of one day being given the chance to join her in a relationship. Even though she did not know and will probably never find out, this was something that bothered me and killed me inside. Ive always been the type of person that likes to listen so whenever I got the chance to talk to her I would listen to all the lovee dovee things that she had to say, in my mind I couldn't give three shits about what she thought about him, cause I a guy and Im straight, but In my face I would reply with the typical âMhhmâ which is not very intelligent if you're trying to get a girl to like you, but at some point along the way of liking her I started to see her interest in him getting very strong, to the point where friends would go out to eat and they wouldn't invite me. Which in case you don't know is a fucking big deal okay! But what was I to doâ¦? Nothing, nothing at all. I didn't have to do anything because I decided to quit the thought of ever existing and I decided to kill myself. This is not a suicide letter, itâs a cry for love. I really need someone to roam the Savannah with me, to show me the beautiful skies of Kenya. I need someone to help me fight for my life in the wild."

"First relationship ended I'm 15 and I'm an introvert who's moved 3 times and can't talk to people at all. Corona happened and I was stuck at home doing nothing. I started playing Minecraft on a server playing bedwars. Met this person who I played with for 2 weeks when I leave to go eat, I come back to find they found more people to play with and wanted me to meet them. The people were 2 girls, (one was 18 and one was 16). I met them both and we got to know each other. I joined a discord server who my ex owned (16 year old) and got into a voice chat. We agreed to pull and all nighter because we could and we wanted to. And in that night people on her server joined the voice chat and they started to talk about birthdays. Then she says ""if anyone can guess my birthday, I'll share a lewd photo of me"" That was supposed to be a red flag but my hormones got the best of me and didn't realize it. I found out that she lives in Chicago and I live in Cali.



Fast forward some time and I start to mention how beautiful she looks and we start to flirt and tells me how nice it would be to meet and kiss, cuddle and cute stuff like that. I really liked her at this point and I didn't want to mention her as a friend so I didn't mess anything up with her in the process. 


Some days later we're all playing like normal and then she just leaves out of the blue. I didn't think much and the 18 year old says not to worry she's just upset. Later on instagram she sends me ""I'm not coming back, It's just not working out"" I'm confused and hurt that she left. She unfriends me on discord too. I reply with that I'm confused on why she left and if she leaves that's on her, can't stop her, I let her know she's hurting more than she knows. 


I can follow up with more it's just turning way too long and I want to hear people's opinions first. Sorry for the long text and if parts were confusing!"

"Effective Methods wantedI don't see a lot of options for me. I don't want this life I was given. It's the ultimate gift I never wanted. I don't want a job, I don't want to get married, I don't want to exist. How should I go about finishing myself? My state's gun laws are byzantine, and there's nothing strong enough in my home to hang myself from. I'd prefer something painless but I'll take whatever gets the job done."

"My dad might be planning on killing himself.  I don't know what to do.I just got off the phone with him and it sounds really bad.  I'm sorry if this is long, but I want to go over as much history that's relevant.

Several months ago my dad lost his job when they randomly drug-tested him and found out he smoked pot recently.  He's spent 25+ years working his ass off in the natural gas industry being severely underappreciated.  Now he's blacklisted in that field because of the circumstances of his firing.  He told me that even the thought of working again makes him sick.  He's just so sick of busting his ass and not being appreciated for it.  It seems he has no desire to even want to get a new job.  After he lost his job, he and my mom had planned on starting a business selling concert ticket collectibles, but he tells me my mom just lost interest in it and wouldn't let him do what he wanted to do so now he just lays in bed almost all day.  A few months ago he attempted suicide.

Yesterday I got an e-mail from my mom that they decided to get a divorce.  Apparently life back home is not going so well.  They had been going to couples therapy, but they had to stop because they just couldn't afford it anymore since my dad stopped working.  My parents hate each other and can't stand being in the same room together.  From what my dad tells me, my mom stopped loving him years ago.  He considers being home with my mom to be hell and just wants out now.

He's planning on moving out but he has no money and no job.  I asked him what his plan was, and he told me he doesn't know.  He's planning on just leaving all his possessions behind and starting anew with nothing.  He said once he leaves he probably won't contact me again since he won't have a phone or an e-mail address.  I asked again him how he would get by and he said he didn't know and that he'll either find a way or he won't and die.

He's currently on anti-depression medication, but I don't even know if he is taking it.  When I asked him about it, he said he doesn't even care anymore and that it's too late for him.  When I showed my worry for him, he told me that he wasn't going to kill himself today or tomorrow.  But that's as far down the line as he would say.  He held his composure until the end of the conversation when out of the blue he told me that he was proud of me.  I told him that I loved him and he said he loved me and then, crying uncontrollably, he told me goodbye and hung up.

Please SW, what can I do??  He lives in Las Vegas and I live in Florida and our line of communication is getting cut as soon as he moves out.  I don't know what to do."

"Posting lyrics I like day 9 Wait right here  
I'll be back in the morning  
I know that I'm not that important to you  
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous  
So much more than perfect  
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it  
If you give me time, I could work on it  
Give me some time while I work on it

Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you  
The Earth's in rotation, you're waiting for me  
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist  
'Cause we only have one conversation a week  
That's why your friends always hatin' on me  
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself  
Matter of fact, I ain't ever asked no one for help  
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings

None of my exes is over Lil Peep  
Nobody flexin' as much as I be  
That's why she text me and tell me she love me  
She know that someday I'll be over the sea  
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed  
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me  
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me

I know that I'm nothing like someone the family want me to be  
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?  
Look at my face while you talkin' to me  
'Cause we only have one conversation a week  
Can I get one conversation at least?  
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach  
This music's the only thing keeping  
The peace when I'm fallin' to pieces

Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason  
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces  
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason"

"Going to end it soonI hate for it to be the reality, but the time has come. I developed a severe disability that has continued to destroy my life and livilihood for the past 10 years. I can't get a job due to it and the daily pain is constant

Unfortunately I made the collosull mistake of getting married and having kids. I love them all, but my disability puts me in a perpetual bad mood and I snap and yell frequently at them. They don't deserve that. And it prevents me from providing for my family at all

Fortunately I had the foresight to purchase a substantial life insurance policy in the past, so when I go at least my family will be taken care if

Its grossly unfair that the world has changed in a way to trigger my disbility, and no one cares. No one can help. Its just nevetending pain and dissapointment. Whatever I did to deserve this, I am truly sorry. Perhaps I did nothing and thus is just a testament to the lack of caring that people have for others when they change the laws to ones that trigger pain for people like me. Who knows

I try to be a good friend and I fail all the time. The number of friends I have is slowly declining. I got really drunk this weekend and sent out annoying texts and Snapchats and Iâve had so much anxiety about it, even worse than usual which is bad. I hate the way I look and the only girl I am romantically interested in is in a long-term relationship that doesnât seem like it will ever end.

Iâve been thinking about it for a while.

I feel like donât really have a lot to live for even though I know I do.

If no one in my life reaches out to me to spend time or talk or anything tonight I will probably do it. I already have a plan. Iâm not going to ask anyone for help because I already feel like so much of a burden.

I just feel like iâve lost all my hope"

Are you all doing alright? I enjoy doing this little checkups because seeing you guys happy makes me feel good. You deserve to be happy. If you need a compliment, some encouragement or just a pat on the back, leave a comment or DM me depending on your comfort level. I just want to make as many people happy as possible.

"Worried rant about my gf ðª- also give me advice plz Hey yâall so first of all TW for ed, sh, suicide, neglect, drug use, and maybe other stuff idk 

So basically Iâve had this girlfriend for almost a whole year now, (we starting dating on January 1st) and I love her more than the earth itself. This girl means so much to me. 

Recently, sheâs been opening up to me about her problems and stuff. I myself am not very stable as you may be able to tell from some of my previous posts. 

Anyway, so she tells me sheâs diagnosed for bpd and depression. Okay, great, I can deal with that. 

I find out her mother, her only parental figure, just. Doesnât buy her food. Her mom is either working or gambling, and even though has the money and resources to do so, doesnât give her enough money to buy her own food with or buys her groceries. She has also body shamed her for many years, so next thing I find out is that my girlfriend has an eating disorder. I also have an Ed, so I wasnât sure if I was really the right person to talk to her. 

Next thing I find out is that she cuts herself when sheâs bored. Just. Self harm for funnies yk. 

Next is that sheâs been using various drugs for many years. Sheâs been stealing her moms weed since Iâve known her, (we were 13, 15 now) and had lots of morphine given to her after a surgery. This brings me to my next subject. 

Tonight I found the worst of it, which is that she tried to kill her self mannnyyy times. Tonight being one of those times. She took way too many morphine pills and for the first time ever told me about it. I wasnât really sure what to do ngl, I canât go over to her house because I literally donât have her address and so I also canât call an ambulance or anything.  Nobody who knows where she lives is awake right now. Iâm super worried about her right now, even thought throwing up probably isnât a good idea given her ED history, im trying to convince her to throw up the pills. 

Iâm sorry if this made no sense Iâm trying to get thsi down quickly for advice."

Long story short I texted my family group chat by accident. So the point to this story is who wants to take me in? If I go back home now imma get beat."

"Iâm 15 and ruined my life my only option is to die and I canât do thatSo in January 2015 I found out I could force days off school then the day after that faked tearing my thigh muscle and managed to get a month off school, then when that month ended I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes which made me have even more time off making it even harder to get back afterwards although for the rest of that year at school (7) I managed to keep an ok attendance and everything was working out then in July 2015 I started to drop off with managing my diabetes which then caused me to lose motivation then in September 2015 I had another month off school, that was the first time I felt suicidal although that didnât last long and everything (except my diabetes which got way way worse) started to improve until after Christmas, in January I had another month off school which caused me to officially drop out in February which is when everything started to fall apart, I started pushing away my at the time girlfriend became essentially a hermit  let my diabetes get worse and basically did everything in my power to make myself worse 2 months later I lost 3 of my 4 best friends (the one I didnât lose being my ex) then just preceded to feel sorry for myself for the next 3 months when I became friends with someone I used to hate whoâs now my co best friend (co with my ex) after that nothing changed until January 2017 when I decided to try and get back to school that didnât work out at all and I just got worse afterwards after that nothing changed until June when I started being even more of a wanker to my at the time girlfriend by stopping talking to her and carried on doing that until October when I started talking to her again in December we got back together and I got a job although me and her only lasted throughout December, in January I badly injured my foot which got infected gave me sepsis and nearly killed me (typical of my luck that it didnât ð)  and I quit my job not long afterwards in March I got back with my ex  and I stopped pushing her away but still wasnât anything close to a proper boyfriend but between March and may was the best period of time Iâve had for years and in May someone kissed her and that was the ""final nail in the coffin"" between us in that way although weâre still best friends but it got to the point where the last thing keeping me going was me and her and now itâs gone Iâve lost all hope because nothings fixable anymore but Iâm too fucking pathetic to even kill myself I went out to jump in front of a car which sounds stupid but still and I didnât even have the balls to do it and I donât know what to do because I canât go back and fix things no matter how much I wish I could and I canât and I canât end it but at the same time I canât carry on because Iâm basically dead anyway all I do is listen to music and watch movies"
"Mom beaten up by son's friend This happened like a year ago but it still bugs me... And I know I'm not a teenager but I'd like some kids perspective on it.

So my son is a big pro wrestling fan. Thatâs all well and good, but one night he had his friends over (also into this ""sport"" they see on tv) and they had some fun facing off against each other. This is also fine, but then someone came up with the brilliant idea that I should be their final opponent after their matches.

Everybody thought this was a great idea, cheering me on. Stupidly enough I agreed, thinking theyâre 11-12 and Iâm a grown woman, how hard can it be rightâ¦ Well it was HARD. I had my ass handed to me more times than I can count, these kids were freaking strong and one after another they kicked my ass! It was fun at first but... Eventually I had to tell them I was going easy on them because theyâre kids to save face, but I really wasnât. I doubt they believed me anyway. At least they had to go home eventually... How can they be so strong at this age?"
"Iâm not trying hard enoughI literally just woke up and my mom is just saying all of these unmotivated things, then when she left I just started crying. Itâs been a while since Iâve cried I was honestly getting worried. My mom told me I wasnât trying hard enough bc I wasnât seeing my study skills teacher on Zoom. But only if she knew how big my mental block is.

I am homeschooled so this is my job, I have 8 missing assignments in each class and my plan is to get 4 assignments done everyday. (I only have 4 assignments each class each month). My mom telling me the Im not trying hard enough is making me realize that I literally canât do anything. Iâm so tried I literally just want to sleep but unfortunately my sleep schedule is flipped.

What Iâm trying to say is that I donât want to die, but that really seems like my only option. You can tell me to suck it up and do the work but my mindset is already so messy I canât really do anything. I tried going to my friends but they canât help either bc they canât focus. Why is this so hard?

Update: she just came into the bathroom telling me how I woke up almost at 2pm (I woke up at 11:30pm) and how my dog peed on the floor.... if I was a sleep, and you took my dog out of my room, why didnât you take my damn dog out?? Then you tell me âitâs not my jobâ or âIâm home sickâ maâam Iâm sick too but Iâm still trying. Just open the door... I donât understand whatâs so hard ab that. This isnât the worst thing but this definitely ticked me off."
"I told my family that I've considered suicide and now I feel like a fraudI've been going through a really rough patch and I've many times now considered suicide as a way out. This rough patch has also consisted of me being in a dull and shitty mood as well as abandoning social and school responsibilities. The thing that makes me feel even more guilty is how nice and understanding everyone in the family is. They noticed my mood change and wanted to help, but they kept helping in the wrong ways and eventually I broke down and told them I'm suicidal and can't get anything in my life straight right now.Suddenly everyone went into overly nice mode and I feel like a dick for making everyone worry and being extra nice to me when I wouldn't have the courage to kill myself anyway. I feel like such an asshole for making people worry and such a whining loser about getting all caught up and I feel like I threatened suicide about my tiny problems in comparison to everyone else suffering and suicidal. And this just makes me want to kill myself all the more for being such a burden in everyone's life and for being unable to deal with my minor issues when everyone else is having such a tough time."

But then I'm at a family dinner tonight, and I'm not even really talking, mostly just listening to my brother and a family friend chat about politics and I occasionally would ask a question or chuck in a statement and my Dad kept putting his hand in my knew and shushing me (not odd behaviour between him and I, but that's a whole other fucking post)
But anyways, this started to mute me cause I normally feel like no one wants to hear me talk, but anyone who has experienced this kinda passive aggressive shit, knows how horrid it feels.

Then my Uncle takes me plate and I say ""Thank you so much"" to then get talked at harshly for 10 minutes by my Aunt and Uncle about how they hate that term and it is correct to use ""Thank you very much"" and I just, I just hit breaking point. 
I got up, walked out and got in my car and cried the whole way home. 

I'm know getting messages about how rude me walking out was. It probably was, but I mean .. I just said Thank you, who makes someone feel shitty for that? How can you say thank you wrong?

I'm so exhausted, I'm so tired of staying here so as to not transfer my pain to others. 
I'm just so over all of it. 

I hope everyone here is finding hope and strength today!"
"Should I kill myself? I don't think I have a choiceI lost a job today that I'd only had for 2 weeks, and taken 5 days off due to a gastro bug really wrecking me. I'm so so heartbroken because it is a job I really want. I'm desperate for it, but they told me I'm fired even if I get my doctor to speak to them to verify my medical certificates. I offered to do whatever I could to make up for the days off but I was unsuccessful. 

I've been out of work for a while because of some health issues and now I'm back on my feet and I got a dumb stomach virus. I'm so mad at the universe. I'm broke. I was relying on this job, and don't blame them for firing me but damnnnn I feel like shit. I should've gone to work but I had stomach pain/diarrhoea/vomiting etc. 

It really feels like this job was my last straw. How will I get another one quick enough? I'm so embarrassed that I'm not good enough for them to give me a chance to come back. 

I have lots of alcohol, a pack of 20 panadeine forte, my Zoloft, paracetamol and ibuprofen. How can I ensure my death? 

Please help me, guys. I don't know how to survive, and I don't want to anymore. I couldn't even keep this job FUCK"

"death is all I think abouttoday I thought about jumping in front of a car, slitting my wrists, jumping off one of my school buildings that's tall enough. I think of new ways to die every day. My GPA went to shit last fall during a major depressive episode and I added an extra year of university because of it. I am forced to work minimum wage jobs and I can't really pursue my short term dreams because I'm too busy. I don't feel like I fit in anywhere because I'm just too aware. Only a few people care about me and I figure the earlier I die the better so I don't hurt anyone else. Today I missed two big assignments because I'm an idiot and didn't check past the five I completed on time. I am sick of believing I can be something and achieve goals when I'm nothing and do not matter. I simply can not fathom a world where I do anything but continue to abhor life itself. Grad school seems impossible. Working in any of the industries I want to work is impossible. I was told all my life I'm gonna be someone because I have talent, or good personality or I'm a good person. but all I want to do is sleep. I'm not good enough to continue living. my life is but a small drop in the collective concious. work might miss me bc they will need to fulfill a position. school wouldn't care and I'd probably get a news article and a memorial from people that never cared about me but I them. my family would be hurt but would be motivated to do better I hope. they never believed in therapy or medication so thanks I guess. my few friends would miss me but I hope they would continue to do their art and do good for me. I just don't agree with this world. how we fight to make money and how you need money for everything. how GPA is really all that matters if you wanna move forward. how chemistry and bio are worth more than happiness. how nothing matters when you want to die. even when I fight like all the great anime heros to stay alive. I just feel like I can't win. I'm embarrassing. Untalented. not a good person. a worse creature. defective in the mind to the point where I'd rather be dead then try to live before I've experienced any real life at all."

i have no future im a disappointment im a failure im useless im just a waste and a burden

ill never have a decent life and i dont want to keep pretending that some day itll get better cuz that isnt gonna happen

im sorry mom, sister, brother, dad you all dont deserve to find me like that but yall will have to be stronger than me cuz i cant anymore

it hurts like hell being so fucking alone all the time but thats how im gonna go

no one will remember in a couple years"
"What do I doSuicide is the easier option. 

I can't and don't want to get out there, make friends, love myself, find something I love to do, and maybe perhaps a woman may come into my life or she may not. I can't do it. I don't know how to do it.

I can't focus on loving myself. The only thing I can focus on is being loved by someone else and that someone else showing it physically, which will never happen. I want to hang myself. "

"I'm so closeI cant take it. I'm staring at a noose and a blade but I dont have the courage. I've tried twice. Something keeps stopping me and I hate it. I don't know what ti do anymore. It feels pointless living. I just try and find something to keep me occupied until I can finally fall into an unrestful semi sleep state where life sucks just a bit less. Theres no point to any of it and I want it to end. I dont even know why I'm making this post. I dont want anyone I know to know. I've already been hospitalized once and I hated it. It never helped. It just helped me to hide it better. I guess I just want someone to know how close I am. It's just me and my dog. Shes my rock. If not for her, I would have done it already. I know my family would take care of her but it wouldnt be the same. I know it. She knows it. I think she knows and it breaks my heart. I just wish I had the courage."
Woo hoo. Hooray. :( I know nobody cares and I probably sound awful saying this but today I have been informed one of my classmates has covid. Yay. I have to isolate and we were going on a trip to madame tussauds tomorrow. I know I sound awful and spoilt but it has destroyed me.

So I have a question: would you join a discord server to meet new people without leaving your home during quarantine?

Both my parents tested positive, so I canât leave my house for about 2 weeks, and I need something to spend my time with. Then I came up with meeting new people because Iâve hardly seen anyone since the whole corona thing started. So I want to make a discord server for playing games, hanging out or whatever you wanna do. But it feels kinda pointless to set up a whole server for just me. So I kinda want some assurance that at least somebody will join.

Yeah I think thats all I wanted to say, so let me know.

See ya!"

"I feel numbI'm the person people go to if no one else is available, and I can't blame them. All I do lately is complain about my problems because they keep getting worse and it's gotten to the point where I can't enjoy life anymore. I feel like I'm letting everyone down all the time. I hate what I've become. I used to be witty, clever, and fun, but now I'm just a black hole that absorbs other peoples energy. It feels like I've lost the ability to feel true happiness. I feel like my life ended when my childhood ended. Everything I did after childhood were just failed attempts at feeling good again.

  


Lately, I just lie in bed and stare at the ceiling every night, until a thought comes across that hits a sensitive spot. Then, I have an emotional breakdown and lose control for a moment. I get the urge to physically punish myself. Sometimes, I take a sharp knife and blindly cut around on my leg. Sometimes, I grab a bottle of trichloroethylene and inhale that until I pass out, although it has nearly killed me once in the past. After a while, the emotions pass on, and I go back to feeling empty and doing nothing, until the cycle repeats. I've lost interest in all the things I liked to do. Nothing brings me joy anymore. The only times I still feel good is after a ridiculous amount of caffeine or a joint, but the feeling passes quickly, and then I go back to feeling like shit.

  


I think about suicide at least a couple of times a day, but I can't kill myself cause there are people who actually care about me. I sometimes lose control over my actions though, so I'm scared I might actually try again. I've attempted suicide 7 times throughout my late teens while I was heavily struggling with drugs, but luckily I never succeeded. I haven't had a proper diagnose yet, but I have all the symptoms of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and avoidant personality disorder. The bipolar symptoms have been present all my life. The others slowly developed over time. I have a first appointment with a psychiatrist this week. I doubt that talking alone will help much though. I'm hoping that medication will help me feel better. I probably should change some things in my life, but I can't do that as long as I feel the way I do now."

"Thank yâall for keeping my ass aliveYâall mfs really care. Iâm 14M (nearin 15) and just started really getting better and happier or at least less suicidal and depressed and stopped cutting after being in a really dark place. I tried to stab myself to death but passed out before I could finish it and I always said I would never regret suicide (or attempting it) and I donât, necessarily, but I am glad Iâm still here bc even though it wasnât worth the suffering, Iâm better now. My parents donât give a fuck. My girl dumped my ass. I woke up in a pool of sticky, brownish blood and no one had even bothered to open the goddamn door to my room and see why I hadnât left my room by 2pm and it didnât get better right away. It never will, especially not all at once, but it could always get better (as well as worse). I was lucky I guess but I think I owe my survival mostly to my few real ass friends and yâall here on r/SuicideWatch. Thank yâall for keeping my sorry ass alive long enough to get better. Even though it wasnât worth it to have suffered all that shit just to be happy ish now and maybe even happy fo real in my future (that I have thanks to yâall and my friends), i am glad Iâm here and pretty happy now. So quarantine has been a crazy motherfuckin ride. Thank yâall again for helping me out. Iâve finally started the path to recovery and I hope to have some updates on my mental health and possibly self harm (and hopefully lack thereof) if anything worth posting happens"

"Suicidal thoughts tendencies are triggered by my demented grandparents.Hi /r/suicidewatch,

**PS: I may sound like the worst person in the world, but please hear me out.**

I used to love my grandparents, but currently feel indifferent to them. They have ruined my life for the past years. I used to love them, but they're such a burden to take care. I have classes to study, I have a body to work out, and I have a life to live.

These people are both suffering dementia. At the beginning, I was concerned and took care of them. I ""walk the talk"" in terms of taking care of them and sacrificing my gym days, library days and possible volunteer/employment opportunities I could've gone into.

Unlike my siblings, I passionately took care of them: prepare their food, gave them medicine and washed my grandfather's fucking smelly, dirty ass. My siblings are half-assing taking care of them--they don't even do their house chores (I wash their clothes, too). I am the only person who actually took care of them. I want them to die right now for my own well-being.

I know what you're thinking: I am a bad person who deserves to be behind the bars &amp;/or be in mental institution. Right? I understand.

All these times that I took care of them I just wasted. I want to kill myself so that I wouldn't have to take care of them. All of my problems originate from them. I've been stressing out because countless times, my parents always asks me to stay because I have the ""easiest program"" (Criminology) studying in University. I've explicitly told them numerous times that I can't concentrate at home--this lead to accumulating work load from school.

I used to be muscular too, with some enjoyable extracurricular activities. But these fuckers had to ruin my life. I am now fat because of these fuckers. I currently in debt of $20,000 in student loans. I've failed and dropped classes before because I have to stay home. As it turns out, there's barely any job in Criminology diploma. My life is ruined. I'm 21 years old, and not getting any younger. My peers from highschool are beating me in life all because they're lucky that their grandparents are dead.

I haven't accomplished anything substantial, academically. I don't want to be that guy who lives in parent's basement because of these fuckers--interrupting my schedules, University-life balance and all. 

I'm sure as fuck that no border security or police institution will hire me as soon as the psychological screening takes place. I used to be happy too, ya know.

I have no one to rely to. Everything's a mess.

I feel like I'm at my limit. I'm smiling to mask the sadness off my face. These fuckers better die before I actually kill myself. My suicidal thoughts are increasing. Please help me."
"I donât know what to doIâm gay, I live in Utah, and my family is deeply religious. I got kicked out of my house about a year and a half ago. Im going to college, where I have a grand total of 3 friends. One of them isnât talking to me and I donât know why. The other two are best friends and one of them told me I make her depression worse when I turn to her for help. I canât talk to anyone, I have no one. Iâve never even fucking held a guys hand in all my fucking life. I donât know Iâm just kind of rambling. I just donât know what to do. Iâm so lonely, I donât feel like I have a home. Iâve tried dating a couple of times but I guess I just get too up in my own head. I just want someone to hold me while I cry. I want my old friends back from before I came out. I just feel like my life is going no where and everyone around me seems to be burdened by me. The only reason I havenât killed myself is because my best friend, the one who isnât talking to me, her dad committed suicide. I could never make her go through that again. I just donât know where to go or what to do to make life bearable.

I have a counselor through my school and I really like him. The sessions feel helpful while Iâm there but by the end of the week I feel like killing myself again. Iâm just lost. I donât see a reason. I donât know how to find a purpose. It all feels pointless. Iâm sorry I donât mean to bother anyone. Ugh I just feel like fucking exploding. Iâm sorry I know some people donât like swear words. Ugh

"Feel like I should be in a trash bagJust about everything seems to be going wrong with no way out. I was very close to an actual suicide attempt not even a few days ago, but it still feels like I should've gone through with it. I lost my job, have no money, stopped speaking and hanging out with close friends a while ago for no reason, and just recently feel like I lost my fiancÃ©. It's just a huge mess and it feels like all is lost. I just don't know what to do."
"we have a class pet my classmate made a a big ball of tape in art, shoved a pencil sharpener into it, drew a face on it and named it harold, and now we take him on walks, feed him pencils,  and talk to him.

"Everything any everybody is boring. But what I canât comprehend, is not boring. Thatâs why Iâll most likely commit suicide soon
What is stopping me from committing suicide? I actually donât have any reason not to commit suicide. I should. Itâs not that Iâm scarred, or donât want to, itâs just that I havenât.

I donât want to die. I want to never have existed. There is no more reason for me to continue. People are fun sometimes but, after some time, they are boring. Iâm boring. Life is boring. I want to know if heaven or hell exist, because those donât sound boring. I want to know how much fun I can have.

There really is noting stopping me. I have nobody. They all died. Iâm not even joking. So why? Iâm looking for the answer. How to kill myself, without actually killing yourself? 

The world would be identical if I never existed, everybody who died would have died, everybody who lives would live. I am nothing, I have no purpose to anybody, and Iâm not the reason for literally anything. Youâll read this, and scroll away, and forget in about 3 minutes. Or youâll read this, message, then scroll away and forget in 5 minutes.

What Iâm saying is, can anybody find me a reason to live? Because life, is boring. And nothing is fun. People get boring, I am boring, Iâm bored. What can cure my boredom besides suicide?"
"Friday nightToday, I got a huge bonus for doing good work over the past few months. I went out at night to Fry's and picked myself up a Wii U. I set it up at around 11pm (still living with parents btw, and I'm 29 years old) and launched Super Mario 3D World. The screen asked that three other players should join in.

At that point I realized my situation, no friends, no girlfriend (never had one), still playing video games while living in my parents house on a friday night (while my parents are asleep). It clicked and I was ready to kill myself at that point.

I'm still having anxiety over this thought. I turned off my wii and here I am before I try to get some sleep."

"This is it. Thanks for everything.[Dont bother and read all this, I just needed a place to write this down I guess]


Thanks for everything reddit, this is it, I am 23 and soon it will all be over.

This morning shortly after my mother and her boyfriend left with the dogs, without saying goodbye, as usual, I took my laptop, external HD, money and some papers and left. 
Left the few clothes I had behind, hated them anyways. I dont have much personal things or anything of value. The only things I have right now is my laptop, my phone, the clothes I wear, my car, ~â¬2000 and lots of debt. Tomorrow I am going to sell my car which should give me another â¬1000, go to the airport and take the next plane to, probably, Ibiza. Live there until I run out of money, rent a car, park it somewhere on a cliff watch my last sunrise and die. I am pretty excited tbh, this will be my first vacation is 7 years and I am going to fly for the first time in my life. Hopefully it is going to be the best time of my life so I will die at least somewhat happy.

I know, this is a pretty radical decision, but it is the best for everyone. There is no hope left for me. No amount of psychological help or drugs is going to fix me, make up for my messed up childhood, give me a loving family or the love I have never received, give me an college eduction, pay off my debt or all the other things I don't want to bother you guys with it really is too much to write down. I am not going to slave away at a job far below my potential or something like that. Not to sound arrogant but my survival instinct isnt that big I guess. 
The last 5 years have been hell, and it wont get any better soon, and even if the last 23+ years are going to haunt me for the rest of my life. I dont want to live a live I am not proud of anymore. I have suffered more than enough.
I hope the few friends I have will forgive me, planning to send them an apology letter but I am sure they will understand and can cope with it. I also hope that you guys find peace sometime, I know there is hope for many, if not the most, of you. 

I have another 24 hours or so to think all this through, but I am pretty confident that I made a decision, the right decision. 

Thanks for everything reddit, I wish you all the best, goodbye.

People are just so fucking selfish. I wish i was more selfish, but somehow i manage to prioritize others before myself. Yet everyone just leaves me all the fucking time.

I think I pushed one of the best friends I could ever ask for away, by clinging too tightly to our relationship. It happens every time I make a friend. I have few left, and I think we're all lonely people.

Today's my birthday. And I feel so. Abandoned. I'm sitting here in a semi truck cab, my stepdad in the bunk asleep, me curled up in the passenger seat. I'm trying to get my life together. I'm going to be a truck driver. If I can make it through the end of the year.

My anxiety is controlling me though. I can't get through a day without feeling existential dread from the moment I wake up, if I sleep at all. It's been like this for years. It's getting to where I just don't want to live anymore. I just need to push through. But god damn it is hard as fuck. 

I wish I could just. Stop. I wish I could just stop and breathe and not feel this shit anymore. I'm fucking angry and tired of feeling this way. I want to scream. I want to disappear. I want to stand up and yell out loud at anybody who will listen about how much pain I am in. Every. Day.

But I have to get through this. Because I'm too afraid to die."
"Job slavery increases thoughts of suicideI donât see a point for working for a living at some dead end job that I wonât enjoy doing for my whole life. My life projection consists of staying at my dads place until heâs passed away then it will probably be a matter of time until Iâm homeless unless my sister gets a job. I just feel like a burden at this point amounting for nothing. 

I got in contact with disability employment services to find work just to keep my dad happy. So Iâll just ride it out with this employment crap while my dad is alive then after that just die from starvation out in a secluded area in my town. And Iâm surprisingly comforted with this thought that one day this rat race will be over."
"I wanted to share an image.Are you afraid of what the face of suicide looks like?  Because she has won.  She has fooled you all and everyone.

Are you distracted by all of this and more?  How cute her face is, how her smile brightens a room, or how her bright green eyes shimmer in the light?  How her life seems almost flawless, like a fairy tale but deep, deep down she has struggled to make it this far?  And then to purposely lose it all in self sabotage to finally have the courage to bite the bullet?  You'll never know.  What others are going through.  Their struggle of addiction.  Their struggle of self worth and self hatred, no matter what they are told.  No matter how much they are loved, self hate will win every time.  You'll never know how deep it is unless you're there in that deep dark hole.  Pray an angle will help pull you out.  Pray it is not too late.  Don't let the darkness consume you as it has me."
Hanging myself this morningI cant take it anymore. Everywhere i go i feel like i dont belong. This anxiety has been following me around since i was 6 years old and the moment i open up to my parents about it they look at my like im a nut case. Im 21 now i have had enough of sitting around and watching everyone else enjoy life while i sit in the corner fantasizing about killing myself. Therapy has done nothing. My parents think im a failure and a nut job. I dont even know why im on this earth. I have considered killing myself since i was 8 and now i have finally had enouft of being treated like a sub human born with this painful disease. People day to rationalize my reason for life but i have been doing that foe years and things have only gotten worse. My life is a living hell hopefully on the other side god takes pitty on me. I just cant do this anymore.

"I'm not depressed I'm angryMy suicidal thoughts have evolved from being depressed to just being anger towards life. It's not the same as when your sad . This is much darker.

"Most everyone here is asking for reasons to live. Here are mine, please add yours I posted on here a few nights ago about my suicidal thoughts. The positive responses from everyone surprised me and I am so thankful for all of them. Since then I've been on this sub every day talking to people that are in the same boat I am, trying to get them to continue on. If I can't save myself, maybe I can save others. That is one reason to live. Below is a list of other reasons, and please post more! If you need reasons to live, pick one or a few of these and focus on it. Don't give up!

1. Live for yourself. Live for no other reason than to see who you become. It doesn't matter what you do, who you know, what your hobbies are. Live so that you can feel how satisfying a full breath of air feels in your lungs. Live for the curiosity of what tomorrow may bring. Live for the now. 

2. Live for knowledge. Intelligence is a value that, unlike most, benefits yourself more than anyone else. Sure, it will get you places in this world, but it will, more importantly, allow you to change your perceptions as you learn about other cultures, science, history, art, or whatever interests you. 

3. Live because as I, a person who helplessly posted in here the other night, write this I'm forcing myself to think up reasons to live. You all made a person that wanted to die think of reasons to continue. You make larger impacts on this planet than you currently believe. 

4. Live to afford yourself the opportunity to move on from past injuries. Work on yourself. Change the mind sets you know are destructive. Focus your energy on healing yourself so you can be accepting of the person that you are. 

5. Live to see the simplicities of life that others never notice. Lay down in the grass (although its winter and cold) and observe the tiny insects within the blades. What are they doing? How do they interact? Do they think or communicate? Feel the wind brush along your face. Notice the pigments of color in nature and how the trees rhythmically sway on a windy day. Look up at the stars and imagine the possibilities that are out there. 

6. Live for the strength you will have once you overcome this, because I know you will. Having worked up from the depths of depression to the highs of appreciating life will make you so much stronger and wiser. You will look back and thank yourself for continuing on. 

7. Live for the fact that humans are the product of billions of years of evolution. We are so perfectly adapted to our environments and we are wired to survive. Survival is instinct. 

8. Death is permanent, life is not. Appreciate it while you can. 

Get rid of the bad in your life and allow the good to flow toward you. It will come, I promise. Live because you want to. You came here for help and i think that means you want to find reasons to stay. Live to find those reasons, whatever they may be. "
"Reddit isn't a community, it's more like a family We have fun together. We laugh, joke and support anyone who needs us. Like every family, we fight and then make up. There might be some bad seeds but every family has bad seeds, so we just ignore them and keep on vibing with each other. We take lonely, depressed people and force them to vibe with us and in the process help them rediscover their will to live. We live in a harmony that no one except us can understand and love.

I love every single one of you. The entirety of Reddit loves every single one of you. If that isn't enough to keep y'all going, nothing ever will be.

"Fuck this20 years old. No job. No interest of getting a job. No girlfriend. No money. No motivation. Can someone give me one reason to carry on living? I fail to see any reason at all.

Almost 22 with nothing to look forward toIâm 21 and I have no purpose. Iâm not nice to look at. Iâm not good at anything. I was considered âgiftedâ as a kid and it turns out I really donât have a gift. I want to enjoy things. I want to get my curiosity back. But Iâm really bad at everything Iâve ever tried. Iâm getting mediocre grades at a mediocre school. I donât have any close friends. I got fired from a bullshit part time job. I have no use to the world. I have no purpose. I graduate in a few months and I have no plans and I have had no internships and Iâm not even interested in my major. All my friends are doing so well and I have to pretend to be happy for them while I lay around and give up on my life. Iâm going to kill myself before I turn 22 in May. Any tips on how to make this hurt my close knit and caring family less? I hurt them a lot by being alive and not being happy or successful but Iâm so afraid that my death will tear them apart. I love them so much but Iâm sick of being the family disappointment and I donât think there is anything I can do to fix my life. I am almost 22 and havenât done anything to mold a career of a life path for myself. There is no hope for me. My future is so bleak and I think it might hurt my family less to end it now rather than be a burden and a beacon of shame forever. But I really donât want to hurt them at all.

"How do I give support for someone I'm growing to despise?Little background: Few years ago my parents got a divorce and my mom began a (somewhat abusive) relationship with someone. Last year my dad died.

Shortly before my dad's funeral it became evident to my mom that she was being cheated on and the dude was going to leave her. So at our dad's funeral my mom was crying, not because her ex-husband had died but, because her boyfriend had left her (I know that my parents marriage had ended and she didn't need to feel bad about it, but to me it was extremelly disrespectful to me and my siblings --- at the moment nobody knew why she was so sad). Few days later, we were stil mourning our dad's death and the reason for her sadness showed up...

Now because her boyfriend have left her she is treatning to kill herself. Jesus Christ, My 50 years old mother is treatning to kill herself because her 36 years old boyfriend have left her!

She became insuferable, her facebook is filled with disgusting messages, posts and whatnot about how everyone is garbage and life have no meaning; she have turned away any attempt of help from any relative. She treats her 73 yo mother like shit (I believe that in her head my grandma have something to do with her being dump). She spent her new years eve on a psych clinic but isn't taking any medicine because of no apparent reason and I think that she is straight up lying to her doctors.

She is just making the lives of everyone miserable (and for me, because of the most retarded reason possible) and I don't know how to deal with it... before I try to help and just making everything worse: how do I give support if I can't stand her reasons and am in fact disgusted by it and by her actions? What should I do?

---
I am aware that I am the asshole in the situation for not respecting her reasons and being in general pissed at my own mother; don't need to bring that up. Or bring it, I don't know.

If the text seems off it's my fault as my English is not so great as I think.

"I'm done.This is it, reddit. I'm done.

I cannot, no, REFUSE to live this bleak, sad, miserable existence that some would call a life. I am nothing more than a a piece of walking, talking, breathing human trash.

I got a 1.3 GPA my first semester in college. I have become an utter disappointment in my family. Not only to my family, but to my fraternity brothers as well. This group of men would jump in front of a fucking bullet for me and I can't even meet a required GPA minimum. I view that as being the biggest, most useless mooching piece of trash excuse for a human being.

I have been dealing with all of that, but the story that follows blew the top. Beware of extreme vulgarity and cursing.

I have been off and on with a girl since I got to college. And when I say off and on, I mean that she would get drunk when I was on sober driver duty, beg me to buy her food (and apparently I am way too big of a fucking pussy to say no), and then she would demand that we go back to my room so she could ""sleep"". And by sleep, I mean beg for me to fuck her, even though I repeatedly told her I would not as she was intoxicated and I was not. It's a moral thing. This would always end with her forcibly ripping off articles of clothing from my body and essentially forcing me inside of her.

And then? She would ignore me. Until the next time around. 

I fucking love this girl. I love her. And every couple of weeks, she tells me she has changed, I take her back hoping for that to be the truth. It never fucking is.

I don't ever want to see that useless, trashy, fucked up disease ridden cunt again.

And since i'm too big of a fucking pussy to stand up to her, i'm doing the only thing I can to ensure that I never, ever, see her again.



EDIT: I talked to friends, as well as the suicide hotline (They fucking suck, seriously. Bitch put me on hold. Logically, you probably shouldn't put a person who has nothing/nobody to live for on hold, forcing them to listen to your shitty hold music.) I have calmed down, and am back in my dorm room. I haven't slept in 86 hours, so i'm hallucinating pretty bad right now, so i'm going to try to sleep."

I'm sorry my son. When I think about him, I think I should live for him. But it doesn't change my suicide thoughts. 
No one will take care of my son without me if I'm gone. That makes me feel so sad . 
I'm very struggling and suffering. Because I'm so alone. People say very easily that I should try to get some help like to professionals. I am tired of listening that. If they helped me, I would be okay now. They were so useless for me tbh. 
I'll try to kill myself again tomorrow.. I hope it will be successed"

Also space debris have lit up the sky in Seattle.

Are we entering a new exciting age of space travel and space exploration or have we already entered the new space age when SpaceX first flew a cargo ship to the ISS?

And for some reason the superpowers want to build ""scientific outposts"" on the Moon.

Lot of typing errors, misunderstandings, even drunk intoxicated posts I later regret. 

I have posted hundreds of embarrassing posts on social media from 2008-present. 

The bullying and unwanted thoughts don't stop. 

I am a human being with friends family and loved ones. 

I am in pain 1,400 minutes of the 1,440 minutes of a day. 

40 minutes of pleasure. 

1400 minutes of I wanna blow my brains out. 

I'm addicted to weed and a perverted idiot with a low self-esteem."
"I hate talking about my problems but even when I want to, I'm scared to be honest.Don't like to talk to people IRL about my issues which is why I barely see psychiatrist anymore. Too anxious and avoidant to face or talk about problems but when I do feel like it, I'm still afraid.

I imagine being at doctor's. I don't know laws well enough. I'm scared to be committed or sent to jail or deemed a nut case, etc. I don't know if I can be 100% honest if I talk to them. I bet I have periods of intense honesty and other times will be a pathological liar.

Back to my worries about law and being committed... yeah should I tell them I fantasize about buying a gun and blowing my brains out as I sit at home by myself, numb and useless to society? Or overdosing on all these opiates I have? Or that I have urges to be a rapist even? Like I don't act on anything so that's ok right? I'd rather they give me the electric chair than commit me to mental ward forever or have me labelled as a loony to everyone I know and can't get a normal job or life ever anyways"

"This is the endI'm transgender MtF, I recently learned that I can't afford my hormone treatment anymore which is really heartbreaking, I've wanted to start the treatment since I was 16, I'm 21 now I've been 3 months on it and I really can't afford it anymore. It just feels like getting out of my house and working for it was for nothing, after starting the treatment I haven't attempted suicide, but now I'm just tired of all of this, I've literally asked money to my friends for food, for my appointments and to pay for my treatment. 


But at this point I'm tired, I don't want to deal with this. So this is more like some sort of goodbye, I'm really really tired of everything, of abuse, of abandonment and of everything my parents have said to me. I wish things weren't like this. I was supossed to start healing now and I really don't want to deal with this anymore.


So I'll see if I can die tomorrow. I really don't want to live if I can't keep going with my treatment, suspending it would be enough to make me attempt suicide again. I also should be on a higher dose of the medication I'm on and it's expensive. Last week I had to ask money to be able to eat. And now I'm tired, I'll just pay for rent, do some things I enjoy and die... This is over. My life is over. I really don't want to keep on living if I'm not taking my treatment. 


So goodbye, hopefully death is just nothingness and it's not reincarnation, because I don't even want to live a life as a cisgender girl. I just want to be dead and stay dead forever."

I keep trying to fight and better myself but something or someone else always drags me down at my highest.

"Afraid to leave the house because of my looks, I want to die.Hello. I should start off that I'm a 16 year old junior in high school. I've suffered from depression and anxiety since about halfway through the 7th grade (I currently take Cymbalta), and I've just recently been diagnosed as having Body Dysmorphic Disorder. I've been having very severe acne for over a year now, and it's the biggest cause of my self loathing. Apart from the acne, I absolutely hate my crooked nose, my height (5'6""), my penis size, my hair, my eyes/eyebrows, my smile is fucking ugly (I avoid smiling whenever possible). I might just sound like a self-absorbed teenager, but it's gotten to the point where I'm afraid to even leave the house because of how I look. I have to force myself to go to school every day, where my ""best friend"" constantly berates me for my bad acne. I can't go out to dinner with my parents and my brother because I'm afraid of stares from strangers. I've been blowing off hanging out with my friends because I just don't want anybody to see me, even those who I'm close to.

 I've been feeling suicidal about this for some time now, around 6 months. I just don't know what to do anymore. The medicine I'm taking (Cymbalta) doesn't seem to help anymore, and I can't seem to find any confidence within me. I want to die. I would honestly rather be dead than have to deal with my hideous looks and disapproval from others."
"I don't want to live anymoreI'm a 17 yr old female and I don't think life is worth living anymore. I feel like I've been stripped of my basic humanity. In numb. I'm tired and I just want to kill myself. My depression has progressed so far that I can't even cry any more. I want to so bad and I feel like I'm not even human anymore. I have no friends, no one close to me and my family takes this all as some joke. I want help but no one wants to give it. The girl I loved doesn't love me back anymore. All my family does is fight with eachother and its so loud in my head and in reality. I just don't see the point. I'm done."
"Theoretically as a minor: If I told my psychiatrist/therapist that I tried to commit suicide, would they have to tell my parents?I swallowed a bunch of sleeping pills last night and it didn't work. Woke up the next morning, nobody's the wiser. I'm pretty sure it'd be a good idea to tell my therapist, but I don't want my parents to know.

Also, should I be worried about any liver or health problems as a result of this?

I guess for some background, I've been suicidal or had suicidal thoughts everyday for about 5-6 years. I'm also almost 18 too. And a bad conversation led to the attempt. I don't want to get more specific, but I'm still worried I'll try again.

And, uh... To the mods, I don't know if saying something I've already done counts as talking about explicit methods... But I think it matters because I'm worried about any health problems that may arise later. If that's still a problem then I guess I can edit it out...

"22 yo old male, lost any hope to be ever succesfulI am reaching 23 this year and I haven't achieved anything yet. I am starting a college this year when all of pepole in my age gradiated.
I am virgin living with parents. Never had girlfriend and don't even trying to get one 'til I will get a job and own space. I will be 26, maybe 27 years old then so who would even want a miserable loser? Yeah, I may lower my age on Tinder and lie that I am not virgin but it's only good for some ONS and not getting any relationship.

Girls never liked me, I was always repulsed and I was the guy who just follow friends but they didn't want to talk with me and I was always behind. No one wanted to talk with me even if I tried. I am feeling like a worthless shit and I am thinking about suicide.

I was also in mental hospital and strongly bullied in school so I am probably fcked up for rest of my life
I am right now fat 6'1, exercising, trying to get super-fit but I am not confident, I can't talk with girls and I am boring. I am even to afraid to be on gym with others or just say ""hi"" ans that's why I am exercising early morning or really late evening."
"I am killing myself tommorrowI will go to work and then i will take my mothers car and drive to the tallest bridge in my area and jump off and die. I am tired of being a sexless, worthless loser. I've tried so many times to cope with the idea of being a virgin. Saying things like ""i should be looking for a relationship"" or ""confidence matters"" but it doesnt. I used to convince myself i was merely gay, asexual or that sex is nothing and its completely stupid to want sex. I realized a week ago i was wrong. Looks matter a lot. Your personality IS your looks. If you have shit looks you have a shit personality. sex does matter, people cannot ignore their biological urge to fuck. I want to have a boring death because i am a boring person who doesnt deserve anything better. I am also worthless. I failed out of community college and i have no skills that make me valuable. My cousins are ivy league students, my stepbrothers work in the NSA and i work at a gas station after having no job for 2 years. I am fat and ugly. People assume i am 20 years old than i actually am and i feel that i never had a prime like other people."
"My marriage just evaporated, my life is endingToday I was blind sided by my wife wanting to separate for issues that I was not aware of and was not given a fair chance to reconcile. I can't imagine how I am going to live the next 24 hours, let alone for the rest of my life. We were together 7 years and I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. And now over the course of an afternoon, my life is over. I can't survive on my own. I died today in all but the literal sense, why not just make it official? I have nobody to turn to, no family. I'm fucked."

"I don't know what to do in life, and I just want to end it.Hi. Title really says it all. I'm starting my sophomore year in high school and I used to have a clue as to what I want to be in life, but I'm starting now to realize that it is impossible for me. My step father pushes me to be the best version of my self but I just don't want to continue. I get good grades in school and I excel in sports, but every single time it's never enough for him. I'm afraid of going downstairs for the reason of being yelled at every single time. 

He'll always figure something out to just lash out at me, and I can't take it anymore. I really want to leave and just not have to deal with him. Everything I do is always below his expectations for me and I always get yelled at because of it. I do everything by the book and how he wants me to do it but he finds a way to insult me and say that it's pathetic. When I try to explain that I feel bad that day or sick, he shrugs it off and says that it's pointless and that since I am a child I should not feel tired or bored. 

I know this sounds pathetic because this issue is not as serious as everyone else's, but I have had these thoughts for a couple of years now, because of him. I've researched how to buy cyanide pills, and all I have to do is earn some money to buy them. It's pathetic though, I am on a foundation for success yet I don't feel any of it. I'm constantly reminded that when I feel satisfied, that it's worthless and amounts to nothing, and that I have to do even more. I just get so so tired of doing more all the time. I'm expending myself, I get pains in my legs because of all the extracurricular activities I have to do in order for my step father to feel proud of me. Everything I do is just unacceptable to him."
"If being short isn't due to the weights I've lifted the past two years, then I finally have a reason to hate my family. My mother's 5' 3"" (161 cm), and I'm barely any taller than her. Most of my family members are generally at an average height, with the exception of me and my oldest brother. When will I grow tall..."
"Not doing it anymore. Iâm killing myself before the end of 2020.Iâm done. I canât do this anymore. Iâm trans, so thereâs one big reason. Being trans fucking sucks, itâs not this beautiful amazing thing the media paints it to be, it FUCKING SUCKS. I gotta deal with shit nobody else in the fucking world ever even thinks of. Have barely any support. Going to undeniably lose my brothers, who are the closest people in the world for me. I lost the girl I love, and Iâd do anything to get her back but I never fucking will. Iâm being set up for failure by being forced into college after I graduate. I canât transition in college, have no money, and no idea what I want to do. So Iâm done. Iâm killing myself around the time I graduate or soon after my birthday. I tried to kill myself last month but I guess I didnât take enough pills. Fuck everything, fuck this world. Iâm done."
"why does it feel so weird and awkward to say ""i love you"" to the people you care about? but like for real tho"
"need opinions Hey I was wondering if Iâd be able to get your opinion on something ?

Would you be able to let me know what you think about my dick?
You donât have to if you donât want to."
"I just wanna share my storyIâve never been normal, I have problems I also grew up with a lot of abuse. I never can let anything go and my mind goes crazy. At one point I was so depressed that I truly thought about suicide. I suffer from UC so not only was it emotional but physical. I started being afraid of death and even feeling like there was no point. My depression got really bad, I donât know wha caused it but it was intense. I began planning to kill myself I wrote a suicide note and threw it out. I was going to make letters for each of my family, I planned to leave late at night and overdose in the apartment parking lot near me. I planned to text my husband as I did it, I became so upset that I was excited for death, I felt bad cause of my kid. I was thinking to myself the pain is so bad and death canât be any worse. Well I started suffering from panic attacks I felt like I was in danger all the time. Finally I gave in and I got on medication. It has helped me a great deal and I wish I would have done it sooner. What stopped me also was one day I just thought to myself âI want to be happy.â Despite not knowing what happens after and the pain I endure I realized only I could stop it. Now Iâm not saying itâs everyoneâs fault that basically itâs your decision. No itâs hard please get help donât do it alone, I suffered years and because of meds I pulled through. I never want to feel the way I felt than...it was intense."
"I don't mean to be a bother, I just need some help...Like I said, I don't want to bother anyone, but I've been feeling increasingly suicidal for a while now. I think of death and smile, I hope I get into car accidents, die I'm my sleep, etc... But I never have the conviction to do it. Occasionally, I make plans to slowly starve myself. Previously, I self-harmed, but that had given way to suicidal plans/thoughts. My boyfriend describes me as a hardcore perfectionist with extremely low esteem, if that helps any.

Please, like I said, I dont want to bother, but I feel so hopeless, I just need some reassurance/help, I'm running out of options and reasons to stay alive. "

"Want To Just Kill Myself, Getting Less and Less Scared of ItI really don't see how people are able to just keep going. I get so mad when I see people who are obviously happy, smiling, motivated in life, or even just able to pick themselves back up. I'm finding it harder and harder to want to keep going at all. I've dealt with depression for a long time now, but for a few years now it's been just unbearable, simply going through the motions without really feeling anything. Even at the start I had a few hobbies, but now I don't have anything. Feel bad when people as what I like to do, because I honestly just don't have an answer. It's enough I go to classes at all, completely numb and unmotivated in the slightest. I'm currently a biology and biochemistry undergrad with piss poor grades. When I started I was simply getting my generals, but at least felt a moment of joy when I declared my major. Though now I'm right back to square one, not caring about my grades and yet still feeling enraged and disappointed at myself for them. Wake up, go through classes and lab, go home, and just sit at my desk alone with YouTube or Netflix, that's really about it for me. I absolutely can't see how the hell I'm supposed to do anything with my life if I'm already like this early on. What's the fucking point?

&amp;#x200B;

Lately all I can seem to think about is how I'd want to kill myself. Seems like the only thing I can do. If I really did, I wouldn't mind just buying a gun or some rope and going out into the woods late at night, decrease the chance anyone could actually stop me. Hell, maybe pop as many pills as I can beforehand for fun. Doesn't matter. At first I was concerned about how much it'd hurt friends and family. But I can't keep going for the sake of others. How the fuck is that something to tell someone anyway? I've never understood how telling someone to keep suffering for your own happiness is meant to be a good thing to tell someone. Killing myself seems like the one thing I know I could do right."

"Another day stuck being meSo many people have told me the same exact thing. Accept myself, love myself, be myself. When you've walked the path I have, Myself is all I've ever had. No Mom, No Dad, no family...and sure...friends come and go. In the end, it's always been me...left alone. And being alone with my thoughts through years of abandonment, chips away at your confidence and self esteem. Answers to impossible questions remain unanswered. Why didn't they want me? What did I do? Why does it seem like nobody cares? Self pity can only get you so much sympathy, that I have learned at 32yrs. Pity &amp; sympathy are something I resent because it gives the false impression that I'm unequal or not good enough. Eventually the self pity goes away...except it's replaced with: 
Self hatred.
Self Doubt. 
Self Sabotage. 
Because logically there must be a reason they didn't want me? Perhaps I wasn't good enough in there opinion. 
Vitriol sets in...
Sour grapes become the mindset. 
""Who needs them anyway? I don't need anyone. I've only ever been able to depend on myself."" 
Live with no expectations. Depend on no-one
isolate
maintain. 
People begin to annoy you, their very presence is an inconvenience. Others successes become my own shortcomings. The what if's could go on for miles. Still...maintain.
 I no longer fear death, but I don't welcome it either. It's life that I fear, this endless...never ending empty life. Yes it's a view of pure melancholy, but when you've lived through it...it's simply just another day..."

"I'm alone. 18/MNot going to lie, these past few days changed my perspective on friends and family. I got kicked out of the house for fighting with my younger brother 2 days ago, and I was close to being homeless without a car, driver's license, friends, or any survival skills. However, my (non-biological) Aunt and Uncle decided to let me stay at their place for a bit. It's temporarily so I won't be here for long.

Before I got kicked out, all I did was play video games, browse reddit, and hang out with my siblings to escape my depression. I had only one friend (my choice, as I was asocial) who cut me off after I ignored him for 2 weeks. We've been friends since 5th grade but my misconstrued thinking told me he was being a nuisance and I didn't need him. 

Now, all I want is security and this ""I'm alone"" feeling to go away. I'm scared shitless knowing I can't go back to my old life of comfort, and even more scared of the fact that from now on, when shit hits the fan I will have no one to turn to, no one to fall back on. 

I'm making a plan to be self sufficent, for example getting a job and getting an apartment, but I'm just terribly depressed. I have no idea what to expect these next couple of weeks and unless I play my cards right, there's a high probability I'll be homeless. And alone.

The feeling of depression was always here, but now it's eating me alive to the point where suicide looks viable right now. I've already gotten a taste of homelessness and I'll do anything not to end up there, even if it takes me hanging myself. Suicide was always on my mind since high school, but now it's one of my few options left.

My life could go anywhere right now. I could be dead or homeless within the next few weeks, or I could be financially stable and be roommates with my cousin in Grand Rapids (he's living with my uncle trying to move out), eventually going onto college to be a librarian as I always wanted to be. It all depends on whether or not I'm able to go outside my comfort zone and make the right decisions and of course, luck.

"I think my friend (F) is being used by her boyfriend (also friend) to get closer or to make my other friend (Also F) jealous. Ok, ok I know thatâs a lot but hear me out

The boyfriend (whom Iâm going to name David) moved to my school about 2 weeks ago. David already knew one of my friends (the one I believe heâs trying to make jealous), who Iâm going to call Alisha.

How do Alisha and David know each other? Well they went to the same primary school together, and they both got in contact with each other around last year. David had a crush on Alisha, and there was some feelings there from Alisha too. They never really ended up together, but they were acting like they were boyfriend and girlfriend, and Alisha ended it because she was getting uncomfortable.

Anyway, fast forward a year, David moves to our school (NOTE: it wasnât because of Alisha, he has problems at his old school). On his third day, he meets my other friend, who Iâm going to call Jemimah. 

I know for a fact that Jemimah and Alisha are close, and Iâm pretty sure that Alisha told David that as they are friends and she was informing him on her friends and stuff (I know that she told him about me) so he knows who everyone is.

Anyway, getting back to the story, according to Jemimah they got talking in class and David said they should hang out after school one time. Iâm pretty sure that afternoon, David asks Jemimah out on a date. David told lots of people he was going on a date, including me, and Iâm sure one of those people he told was Alisha. To me he didnât say who, so I assume to Alisha it was the same.
After their date, Jemimah told me that they are a couple, and I believe they were going way to fast. Like, they just met, and they are already together. Doesnât that seem suspicious??

Now why do I think David is using Jemimah to get closer/make Alisha jealous? Well I have multiple ideas. 

1. Iâve notice that David acts the same around every girl, including Jemimah (Iâve noticed that he doesnât really act all excited or happy around Jemimah)
2. He talks way more to Alisha than Iâve seen him to Jemimah.
3. He knows that they are close friends.
4. David legit asked Alisha if she wanted to come with them on his and Jemimahâs date (she didnât go).
5. He doesnât act all boyfriendy around Jemimah (MEANING: Iâve never seen him hug, hold hands, or do anything like a boyfriend would do with Jemimah)
6. Legit after meeting each other they end up together. That seems way to suspicious.

Can you see what I think here? My point is, I believe that David still has some feelings for Alisha, and obviously he wants to be in a relationship with her, so heâs using Jemimah until he gets his way (which will probably be never).

I think this is the wrong sub to post this on but oh well I need to hear your opinion on this."
"(low priority) i finally started thinking about itI'm in no immediate danger. I'm not even sure this is the right subreddit for it.  

It's just... I've been doing great. I've been working on my career so it'd look great in my CV, my body is sore of the immense workouts, I'm studying a lot of things, I even managed myself brushing teeth twice a day instead of once (or none at all). I have even read a fiction book, for the first time in, like, 5 years.

I have no idea what caused this. It was 5:00 AM, I jumped into the car, feeling really sad and alone and hoping that it'd cheer me up, drove right to the nearest McDonalds' drive-thru. I was crying, like, for 20 minutes. Then, out of nowhere, I had a thought that it'd be a great time to kill myself.  
Perhaps, a McMuffin saved my life - that shit is awesome.  

I hesitate telling anyone close to me about that. I think I'm overreacting. I _am_ overreacting. It's really irrational and stupid, and I haven't even ran of the possible options to climb out of it - like, saving some money to finally get a therapist instead of wasting it on gas and junk food. It's just a nice thought to have. I don't really contribute anything crucial to the community. I do my best to support my friends and my girlfriend in their tough times. I like to think that I'm not that bad at it. And now, when I feel I need someone of them to talk to, I just think ""nah, they won't help me anyway. What do they know about that feeling. It'd just make things worse. They could even gossip about me. They'll just dismiss it.""

It takes a lot of preparing - if I were serious to kill myself, I'd make damn sure it would be lethal. I'm too lazy to prepare.  But the McMuffins solutionâ¢ won't last long. And, being depressive (but not suicidal) for a long time makes me think that I'm becoming suicidal. I'm just curious how much time I've got left till I choose to do it.

How the hell do I say the truth to them that I'm not OK without them feeling shitty or sorry for me. "
"I don't know if it's me.This is a throwaway account. 

I just don't know if it's me anymore. Things with my mom have been getting worse and worse, and I think she thinks it's all my fault. I think it's her. We fight all the time, and some of the things that she says breaks my heart. We have so different perceptions of what's going on, I just don't know who's right anymore. I can't tell if she's right, and I'm the one who's making everything harder, or if it's the opposite, and I'm right. Or does it even matter? I don't know. I'm honestly just so tired of trying to figure it out. 

Thank you for listening."
"I feel like something is wrong with me There is this girl at my school, we very much dislike each other, and we only ever interact when we have to, shes friends with people in my friend group so relatively often we do have to interact. It's usually sarcastic comments and back handed compliments to each other, but the other day when me an a few friends were hanging out, we went by our school, and for whatever reason when we walked by places it made me think of her, not in like a, ohhh I like You kind of way, but not in bad way either, I almost miss the bickering, and I feel like thats messed up, maybe I just miss social interaction but idk I feel like my brain is  broken"
"Creeping up on meHi I donât Know who to tell or trust with this. I am in the military and have been stationed over seas for over a year and some change. Honestly I have posted before on here about how I almost killed myself but didnât lord knows how but I am here and breathing. Honestly itâs gotten kind of better but I still have that feeling of wanting to kill myself lots of times I still feel like a burden on everyone I talk to,everything I do in my job and in general. I just feel emotionless and anxiety ridden tbh itâs a feeling like I donât care at all something itâs just not right but I find everyday I want to kill myself and it creeps closer and closer on me I just want to find some happiness genuine happiness but I find that hard to come by."
"Should I wait or just go through with it now?Im a 35 year old male and I really really want to kill myself, I have too many reasons which I won't get into here but I'm just not happy in this world, I never was and I don't want to be here anymore. The problem is my parents. I don't want to put them through it. I had always planned on waiting until they were no longer with us and then I could kill myself guilt free. But it's getting really hard. If I do it now it would hurt them but maybe they will get over it? I feel trapped because I have to put up this pretend mask that everything is OK and I'm normal even though they know I've never had a girlfriend my entire life. But recently it's been getting harder and harder to keep it up. Should I just end it now or just suffer on in silence for another 20 years?"
"I feel like sometimes it must just happen.I feel like no matter how many hotlines are set up, some people will just slip through all of it and eventually kill themselves, if not now then later. I might at least just be talking about myself, but that's still what I think.

Some people go on and on, either no one else notices the warning signs or if they do, they either don't say anything and those who did get pushed away, which is what I kept doing. Even though I've always felt like my whole family and everyone I've known knows I have nothing to offer, that I'm a huge dumb ass and just overall a huge joke. When couple of teachers did reach out I just declined. A couple of old friends tried to reach out and again I declined. I'm too embarrassed to contact any of them again because then we would have to talk about how we are and what we've been doing. They would say they are at university and have partners or whatever and the only honest answer I could give about myself is that I kept dropping out of school and I constantly think about killing myself. That's the only thing that goes through my head. I have no skills, I'm useless at finding jobs and my only hobbies seem to be hating myself and feeling sorry for myself.

The end."

"My friend just informed he's suicidal, I'm lost.He and I met last year and have gotten increasingly closer as friends, through bio class and mutual frees. He's a great guy, quiet, but really means a lot to me as a friend, and I would feel destroyed if he took his own life. Back in September he was in the hospital for a 'heart problem' because of some medication, but told me today that this was an attempt at suicide, and I fear he's going to do it again because he's become more quiet and generally less enthusiastic about all of things he, my friends, and I usually do together. On one hand, he's my friend and told me this in confidence, so I feel bad betraying his trust. But I love him and can't see him do this, so I need to do something. I don't know what. We're both 16 if that means anything. Thanks for your time."
Trump is not my president Neither obama was im not American
"I got help for myselfToday I have a psychologist appointment with one of the best psychologists in the state. I felt suicidal for two years and didn't tell anyone because I thought that if i did, things would only get worse. And they did for a while. Everyone I knew questioned who they were, asking themselves ""What kind of friend am I that I didn't notice one of my best friends is suicidal."" It took me weeks to convince them it wasn't their fault. But now we're here, and I'm getting help for myself. And I don't regret it one bit."
"I won't say life sucks, I think its just not for me.Hey I'm 18 years old and I've done a lot of stupid things.. otherwise I wouldn't think I would be here right ^^

Now. I do have a loving family, my parents try to support me in all my life choices my brother and I happen to like the same hobby and we have a lot of fun doing our hobbies together but..

Everytime I just look at the future, I don't see any reason to stay alive. there is no job that I really want, no education I want to follow. Everything is just so boring to me. Now I know I've said that I like doing this hobby but its no where near a realistic ""Job"" option. and I don't think its worth living for eather, 

 I can't be having 0 income so I have to do atleast something. but I cannot figger out what. I tried a lot of things and afthere some time I keep on dropping it. and now for next school year I've got nothing... nothing at all, no job, no school, no money, no plan... My parents can't understand it and there quiet mad at me for not finishing any education.

So now I'm left to do nothing all day. normaly I would be called crazy for complaining for not have to do anything, but for me its a an othere reason to kms.

As a mentioned in the beginning I've done quiet some stupid stuff, I basically lost all my friends over mistakes I've made, for example I once went to Japan with my 2 best friends but I was acting such childish and annoying that when we got back both my friend never wanted to talk to me again. 

Ive got noone, and Im mostly left lonely, so today I've desided that I will finally put a end to this. 

Good bye ^^ live a happy life."

Should I text him or nahh, I already tried texting him like 2 months ago but we had a conversation and it was over then and there. idk what to do"

"Just want someone to talk toI feel like I'm just, I don't even have words anymore.

Incredibly lonely. Everything in my life should be looking up, but all I can wish for is to not wake up, every night I go to sleep. 

I don't know how to fix anything, and I feel, in so much emotional pain, torment, and agony, it's, excruciating. It's, so heavy, and I just feel like it's destroying me, crushing me, to the point, that I can't think, of any steps, to make it better. 

Thanks"
"[F18] Feeling the urge to attempt for a 4th time after 5ish years without feeling so lowFor context: Iâm 18F, I have a 19F girlfriend, my biological mother 39, step dad 42, half sister 8, not step dadâs kid, and step siblings F22, M14, M11. 

Iâve made several attempts in the past, ever since I was 12. Telling my mom I was suicidal years ago was answered with âthen go kill yourself, see if I care.â

My stress levels are at an all time high between college, threats of being kicked out, threats of rent, my relationship, my crazy step dad and sister, of being ghosted by potential employers, traveling, etc. Iâm on Zoloft for anxiety and depression, lost my father at age 2, my half sisterâs father tried to rape me on multiple accounts and my mother refused to call the cops on him bc of my sister. My step father, who came into my life around age 15, frequently calls me a monster and accuses me of trying to tear my family apart. My step sister constantly instigates fights and talks crap, then turns around and treats me like her best friend so she can use my art supplies and my car. 

I feel like my mother doesnât want or love me and like the world will be a better place without me in it. The only people who would care are my gf, my little sister, and my M11 step sib, and these three people are the only reason i havenât attempted these past years. Perhaps my one other friend, but no one else, really. I refuse to go back to therapy bc my mother will make my life hell again. 

Iâm currently alone at Epcot on vacation with the family (they guilted me into going), after my mother told me to go away because I was ruining everyoneâs appetite during lunch, after my step sis instigated another fight that only i got yelled at for. Calling my gf ended with lots of âYouâre stronger than this,â and âyou need to calm downâ and âstop talking about what happened.â So I figured Iâd post here for the first time."
"I actually started reading a manga Cuz the anime ended on volume 4 and I didnât think thereâs going to be another season

"Last day on EarthHi
I'm an ordinary student (I study at a good university, but I don't think that it makes me special). Today Iâm having a representation theory test, after which Iâll take a little walk and kill myself.
Nothing makes me happy and despite all my abilities and a possible scientific career, I think about committing suicide, since I do not see anything good in my existence.

should i tell my school counsellor iâm suicidal?iâm at school right now and wrote a note about how suicidal i was but i donât know if i should give it to my counsellor. will i be hospitalised if i give her the note?
"A ReleaseSuicide has always been a thought on my mind. When I was a kid, I found things to cling to, so that I would never do it. A quote from a book, the cuteness of a puppy, the taste of my favorite food, the fear of the afterlife. It kept me going for 23 years. I felt safe from myself. 

This year has torn me apart. I have always been optimistic. There is a piece of my childlike innocence and joy that has stayed intact, through all the hardships life has thrown at me. I felt like I could endure anything. That I could defy the world and keep a part of me pure. My hope and endless love to give has kept me going. But it's not intact anymore. I feel pieces of who I am dying, being taken from me. At first, I thought it was just me finally growing up, like the world has to take that part away from me for me to be an adult and truly live. 

It feels more sinister and dark now. I gave myself a year to follow my heart, to take risks, damn the consequences. No risk, no reward, right? I did everything I should have. I did everything I needed to. I just wanted a light at the end of the tunnel. I wanted just a glimmer of hope. It seems silly to put so much into New Year's. It's just another day, right? But I used to care so much. I used to feel uncontainable joy and excitement. No matter what I was going through, I could always just focus on the little things in my future that would bring me joy. They would keep me going. Now I'm realizing, I can't do that anymore.  

It brings me to the question, is life worth living if who you are dies? There are small, but unique parts that make me who I am. They have been sacred to me. For the first time, I'm losing them. I can't hold on anymore. As much as I have struggled and hurt over this year, I have held back from this. I haven't posted here. I haven't planned anything out. Never wrote a note. Didn't check myself into a psych ward. Didn't call the hotline. Nothing. 

That has officially changed. I just finished writing a goodbye. It felt good. I don't know what tomorrow brings or if I will see another year. For the first time, I really don't know. That scares me more than anything. 

I think I just wanted to say that. I can't say this to anyone I know. My family and friends don't know this part of me. My partner is the only one who knows and he's grown tired of hearing it. 

I hope I don't wake up. Every night, I just hope that I never have to wake up again."
I just let a loudddd one rip and I forgot my cat was in here too She fucking woke up from the fart and then ran out. I feel so ashamed.
Iâm hurtingBeing lonely is giving me physical pain and making me sick. I donât know how Iâm supposed to hold on when nobody has ever cared about me. I have no friends or romantic parters in my life and I just donât see the point in continuing on if my whole life is spent staying up until 3 am trying to cry but not being able to.

"Maybe everything doesnât work out in the endI canât do this anymore. Iâm tired of feeling useless, I thought if I found someone who loves me l the suicidal thoughts would go away but they didnât.

"I'm not even sure why I'm postingI was recently diagnosed with Bipolar disorder after dragging my girlfriend through a year of behavior I couldn't fathom myself. I'm currently going through treatment though. But she witnessed my first manic episode of my entire life and I'm so embarrassed. My mental health is getting better but I don't have any good friends in my life anymore. As I have consistently moved, I was bullied in high school, and one of my two good guy friends from high school came on to me over thanksgiving break last year (I'm a lesbian).

I met my girlfriend my freshmen year of university, fell madly madly in love with her and for 11 months now we have been dating. Month 10 is when I had my manic breakdown. I'm currently home for treatment and it's going really well but until I get back and prove to her that I can balance school, our relationship, and my mental health, I've been feeling really really suicidal. My suicidal thoughts have flared up in years, but this past month it's been an every night kind of thing. 

I don't want to burden her by talking to her about it. I just don't know how to tell myself everything will be okay and believe it."

"I wonder who really caresI know its really selfish to say, but sometimes I wish I could just try killing myself (not succeeding) so I could simply see how people would react. How many of my ""friends"" would really care? I'm sure some would be sad, but how long would it last? How long would it take for them to go back to not caring about my depression?

I know people will be sad when I die, but does it really matter if they are? No one cared enough to try supporting me better when I was still breathing, so why should it matter if my death upsets them? 

Who knows, maybe I'll get to find out the answer to that question real soon. And then maybe I'll know."

YOU WERE ALL THAT I HAD LEFT AND I FUCKING FUCKED THAT UP TOO. FUCK ME, OK? FUCK. ME. I DESERVE TO DIE.

so walk out the door like everyone else and give up, because its apparent to me now im a lost cause. i hurt you and thats the one thing i promise i wouldnt do and i fucking ruined it due to my fucking bullshit. i want to fucking die. i want you to stop hurting. me dying would stop you from hurting anymore. so just dump me like c did and leave me to die alone like i deserve. find a nice pretty girl that has a perfect body and a healthy mind, and lives close to you so you can actually get what you need from her. im not suitable, i fucking failed my objective. it was to save you and protect you. and all i did was fuck it up. and thats unforgivable in my eyes. im unforgivable. i want to fucking die because of it. i want to fucking die. i dont know what the fuck is stopping me right now. i think its only because i want to hear it come out of your mouth. tell me that you want me gone, and i will be. tell me to go die, and i will. tell me how horrible and selfish and fucked up i am, and ill agree with you. im completely in the wrong just like i always have been, and thats why i deserve to apologize all the time. i wish andy would have ended up killing me or fucking me up to a point where life wasnt possible anymore. anything but me doing all of this to myself. 

i fucking love you. more than the air i breathe, more than the soul that occupies this shell of a body, more than every fiber of my being, more than what this universe can hold. more than LIFE. i fucked you up, and im sorry. i always said your exes were the most fucked up, when really its me. im the ultimate fuck up, and no one has managed to ruin things like i have. i knew it was a matter of time before i fucked it all up. im sorry. sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry. and no matter how many times i say it or how much i mean it itll never be good enough for you. and thats how it should be because im a piece of shit that deserves to die. no one wants me. not c, not my family, none of the people that called themselves my friends, society, the world-so why not you, since you were all that i had left. you were my everything, and i let you down and broke my promises. i deserve nothing better than to brutally die and decompose under the dirt and be left to be forgotten. i hold nothing against you. this is all towards me. nobody else messed up or did this to me, this is my fucking fault. i shouldnt have even been born-that was a literal mistake too. not succeeding every time ive attempted suicide was my fault and was a mistake as well. im your biggest mistake. and i fucking hate myself for it. i dont know what im going to do about this. i dont deserve your forgiveness or empathy or anything else from you at all. i deserve nothing, and i deserve to be nothing. its a sin to hurt someone like you, and ive done it multiple times. i just need to die. i was never meant to stay in this world for that long, anyways. its been made clear that this world just doesnt want me, no matter how hard i try to not fuck up. try to accept my apologies someday, try to get beyond my heartlessness and foolishness. just forget about me, and let me disappear. 

i'm done. fucking done. im done trying to help people. im done trying to find true love. im done disappointing everyone. im done fucking up. im done not getting better. im done breaking things. im done hurting everyone. im done being a burden. im done being a waste. im done being hated. im done being abandoned. im done being crazy. im done being tired. im done breaking down. im done being broken hearted. im done lying. im done being lied to. im done trying to fit in. im done re-inventing myself. im done trying to survive. im done wanting to live. im done trying to be a good person when i know im not. im done trying to keep control of myself. im done losing my most prized things in life. im done trying to be happy. im done trying to be ideal. im done trying to be smart. im done trying to be important. im done trying to be worthy. im done trying to be talented. im done trying to get sober. im done trying to stop cutting. im done losing friends. im done crying. im done bleeding. im done laying alone and cold at night. im done being the most unwanted person on the planet. im done hating myself. im done trying to keep holding on. im done hoping. im done thinking im going to be saved. im done thinking that this is only temporary. im done sinking to new lows. im done fucking everything up for everone. im done trying to change myself. im done at trying to recover. im done being depressed. im done being delusional. im done being bipolar. im done with me.

"I am tiredI'm stuck in a bad marriage with a man that treats me like shit and is emotionally abusive, I'm unhappy and lonely. 

I feel like i have no family as they never make time for me, but always do for my brother.

I am always a second thought to all of my friends, and some even have ghosted me even though I'm mostly happy go lucky.

I'm stuck at home with two young kids everyday, haven't worked because I can't afford childcare and now it's going to take forever to get something that pays enough.

I'm tired of anxiety. I'm tired of all the constant problems popping up. I'm tired of feeling like shit. 

Tonight he told me that no one actually cares about me, only he does and if others do its because I'm not my true self with them. My husband said that to me. All started because I told him his game is much more important than I am these days.

If I didn't have my kids, I'd hang myself. Sick of being beat down by people, mental illness, and pure bad luck. "
therapist said she isn't able to help meSo I went to see a therapist cause I was close to killing myself and i told her about how my scars were bothering me and she basically told me she can't fix my scars so I guess i'm fucked? Life is fucking miserable living as a monster in the world simply because I have scars that I had no choice over. If a therapist can't help me then I guess I am hopeless and am just going to kill myself now as opposed to waiting to inevitably kill myself in the future anyways. What's the purpose of life when people treat you like shit simply for how you look. Guys make fun of me and girls laugh behind my back. I have never had a girl interested in me and never will. Whenever I go to get my haircut the stylist always tries to get it over with as fast as possible since they do not want to be in my presence. My existence is pain and time to get rid of it. No one is going to read this but I felt the need to write this to someone as I have no one to talk to in real life.

"I'm not threatening my boyfriend but without him I'm going to kill myselfI've been suicidal and self harming since I was 9 and had my first suicide attempt since I was 10. I kept going though. Because I had a feeling that one day I would meet someone who would make everything better.

My boyfriend is that someone. He made me happy and it was like I had never had a problem in the past before. I stopped cutting and stopped being suicidal. But during Covid where were barley talking online because he's always busy helping out his family. And I can't help but think he wont love me after this. Maybe during Covid he's going to realise he doesn't need me and leave me.

Before I was with him I was going to kill myself. From a bad breakup with the guy I thought was the one (really wasn't he was a dickhead to me). 

And if he leaves me I'll go through with what I had planned back then. This isn't a threat to him. I want him to be happy. And if leaving me will make him happy then it's okay for him to leave me. I haven't told him that i feel this way. Suicidal again. Because I don't want to guilt him into staying with me.

But. Until he either breaks up with me. Or he doesn't. Ill keep trusting him. Ill believe everything he says to me. Every reason he isnt talking to me. I'll be there for him any time he needs me. And I'll keep telling him I love him. Cuz I do. He is my everything."

"I have called the suicide hotline and used crisis chat a few timesI am looking for a solution, not comfort. The hotline and chat have both only been able to provide comfort, which was useless for me because I have only used logic to justify suicide.


Every time I reach out is a desperate attempt to find someone else that has stumbled down a similar path towards making a real positive change in the world. One person doesn't stand a chance, nearly everything stacks up against them to make even a local change. I don't know what I could possibly say to find that kind of person anymore. I am exhausted. 

All I can see that I can do now is to serve an example to not let your dreams be dreams. I will build my plane and fly it, or die trying.

Fuck. Everything is dripping with greed. Spending my life trying to sort out alternatives and lifestyles that benefit everyone and make sense... just to have people look at me like a fucking nut. Apparently not wanting to take advantage of people is an alien concept to this world. I can't find words for the disgust it brings me.


I believe I am beyond help. I'm mostly just putting this here for myself so that I can say I tried. I don't expect a change.


It's scary stuff. I can't talk about this sort of thing because I am terrified that if who I am speaking with actually understands it, they will fall into the same conclusion I am currently at. I'm going to try not to think about it now. Not much use though, seeing as it has been on my mind every day for years. I am so tired."

"I am mostly staying alive for my 13 yr old sister.The other day, she saw me in the sun, and told me I have freckles... well she thought they were.

I have mom and dad and 7 siblings, she is the youngest, and sometimes the most supportive and understanding, I really care about her, We all had a very rough past, but the youngest had it the least bad as the oldest (Me+older Sis) Kinda died for their sins and helped give them freedom we didnt have. I want her to succeed, my family is so dysfunctional I think she may be the only one that is completely salvageable at this point, but sadly she is showing some depressive symptoms. I feel like I have let all my siblings down, but I am very close with this one, and I will try my best to spread my knowledge to her and help her. "

"Question about Demisexuality Hi, I suspect that I may be Demisexual/Demiromantic but I'm kinda confused.



From what I heard, being Demi is not being able to feel physically and/or romantically attracted to someone without forming a bond first?



The only crush I've had is someone I've known my entire life and I've liked him for over a year. I can acknowledge that someone is attractive or a good person but I would never date them or imagine kissing them until I got to know them. I couldn't even imagine kissing my crush during the first month or two that I liked him

"I was told to post hereHello,

So I made [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/jwwh9/dae_have_suicidal_thoughts_on_a_daily_basis/) last night somebody told me to make a post here. 

So basically I've been having suicidal thoughts for a few years now - thoughts like how I'd kill myself, who would be effected, what if anything would happen to me afterwards. Never really crossed into serious planning, but at one point I put aside a bottle of Oxycotin and Vodka and hid it in my bookcase. It's made me feel really good to just have it sit there, but I have no plans to use it.

I don't think I'm depressed - I'll have my waves of bad thoughts but I'd say a good 80% of my day is me having genuine fun and being happy. 

I just don't really know where to go from here. I thought the suicidal thoughts I was having were as normal as people's murder/rape thoughts. Happens a few times a day but never anything serious, so no harm no foul, right? But reading some comments last night and this morning have led me to believe that suicidal thoughts are not normal, but I'm pretty confident mine are just thoughts and will never lead to actions.

Should I just go on with my life like normal?"
"Fuck man, idek Hey guys, my name is ----- (but you can call me badger) and im a 19 year old Canadian (No I dont live in an igloo). It is currently 2:47 am and in a grand total of 12 hours I will be moved into a newly built apartment with my best friend. I don't know why I'm writing this, probably just to clear my head/tell someone what's going on in my head without directly telling them. If you dont want to read this you dont have to, no one is forcing you lol. This shit is all over the place, sorry about that.

Honestly I should be excited about the next step in my life. It's time to spread your wings, or whatever they say. I've got everything a 19 year old could ask for, loving parents, good friends, a job and a car. But for the last few years I've been spiraling further and further down the abyss. Waking up is a task for me, I hate going to sleep because in my eyes that is accepting defeat of this day and the next is doomed to repeat the last. A few months back I got medically diagnosed as severely depressed, yet nothing has happened to change that. I try and hold my shit together with comedy and that's what I've been doing for the past 3 or so years to make myself feel good. I rarely find pleasure in any anymore, I do what the books say and put on a smile and fake it till you make it. That works most of the time but there is still the underlying feeling of hollowness. To get my brain to make me feel good I've taken up multiple hobbies that i enjoy, (warhammer 40k, dnd), but the main thing that's made me happy is seeing other people happy because of something I've done. So cracking bomb ass jokes times perfectly has been my go to. But that can't fix the fact of me constantly feeling like I am sub human, worthless and constantly second guessing myself. Because I joke all the time no one takes my seriously.  I told my mom that I got the results back from my mental health test and out of a score of 100 being the best and 50 being average, you'll never guess what I got. Fucking 3. I scored a 3 out of a total of 100 on a god damn mental health thing from my therapist. My mom didn't believe me when I told her I was depressed and even after she saw the test and was explain to by the therapist that I was at a high risk of depression, she was still skeptical. ""How could you be depressed, you always look so happy."" My mom owns her own business, but its failing, and my dad is a prison guard. In the 19 fucking years I've been alive I have very very few memories of my dad because he is always at work or sleeping or playing online poker. He was hit and injured in a car accident just before I was born, we have the money and opportunitys to get my dad the surgery's required to make him 100% again but because the fact he is now obese and refuses to lose weight is not able to. I ve never really had long talks with my dad, whenever we are on long drives with him it always feels like I got paired with someone in a class project that I kinda know but not really, so conversation is really limited. I hear hes a really interesting person from the story's I hear about him tho lol. My mom has always wanted the best for me but I always seem to fall short of her goals. Because I'm the oldest of me and my siblings I am the ""test child"" and because of this I am emotionally ruined (I cried for the first time today in over a year), and I have tust issues. She wants me to work where my dad works and has been telling me that I should do something law enforcement related all my life. I humor that idea because every time I say I dont want to, she asks what i was going to do instead and I'm always got with why any of those ideas are good choices and how I would make a great cop.i graduated from high school in 2019 and if done 2 classes at university for criminology 100 to get a degree to be what I refuse to be. And I've failed it both times. She wants me to be my dad, but I hate him and I dont ever want to be what he is. He as no life outside of work, hes a stranger to me who shares blood. I've never been good in school, I'm pretty sure I only graduated because the teachers didnt want me anymore. And that's fair lol. But Iv constant let me and my mom down regarding my grades. I was in French immersion for 3 years (grade 6-9) and that solidified my hatred for school and public learning. I'm a pretty big guy and I have played football for the greater part of 10 years. I enjoy it some times but the other times I wish I didnt exist. But it's gotten me through hard times with the family I make as a team. I've only had 2 girlfriends, the first one I really enjoyed but it was cut short for some bs reason and that broke me and that still has hurt me ever since, it's been over 2 years since the break up. The other one was 3 months of soul draining depression just for it to end with me finding out she's been cheating on me since the beginning. I found out on feburary 15th btw. So it's safe to say any form of emotion a person should have has been safely locked away deep deep down never to see the light of day. It deal with the stress of life and my problems I'm now addicted to nicotine (vaping). I have almost taken my life 2 times in the past 2 years but I reason with my self out if it. I have come to the conclusion that life will end naturally and that I should enjoy it and not end it. So as much as i would feel like i HAVE to end it i will never do that.

Today while i was going through all my stuff i did a lot of self reflection and holy shit yeah, my brain is fucked lol. I found some developed photos of me and my first gf and some friends from 3 years ago and, I would give anything to go back and relive those 3 days. Seeing all my stuff sitting in boxes really makes you realise the fact that nothing makes sense and your are just trying to keep up with everything. One friend got sucked back into a relationship with his crazy ex so I wont be seeing him, another friend is probably going to join the army so wont be seeing him, and another friend will be moving out into the woods and live off the land so wont be seeing him. I've tried to date again but everytime I fuck it up. All I want to someone there for me. Not a guy. A female that will take me seriously when I nee to be taken seriously, someone I cant truly trust with my emotions and feelings someone I can hold and be told every will workout. I have always been the rock, the ear to listen to a rant, a shoulder to cry on, and a source of advice, but there is only so much talking to yourself you can do before it gets repetitive. Because of these and a few more reasons I have hard times smiling. But, I have everything, I shouldn't be sad others have worse situations, there is no reason why I should be sad all the time. And that's just makes me sadder. 

Nothing on the inside, nothing on the outside 

In conclusion/ tldr 
The big sad fucking sucks bum"
"I'm lonely and a virgin and nothing makes me happy anymore.I used to have a hobby that I really liked before but now I just can't find the energy to do it. Now I'm just a NEET waiting to die.

My friends and I never meet irl anymore and I haven't talked to anyone outside of my family in months. I hate how I look and I hate that I'm never tall enough or charming enough for a woman to have romantic feelings for me. I really wish I had a method to kill myself but I have nothing no guns or nothing so I guess I'm just stuck where I am in life. 

Edit: I'm just scared y'know? Scared of what I might do normally when I'm not sad I don't wanna kill myself but in moments like this there is nothing I wanna do more."
"I donât want to live anymore, but I donât want to die because of the guilt Iâd feel leaving my family behind.I canât take the abuse anymore. Life has been ruined. I canât sleep at night. Was told my life didnât matter. And maybe they are right. But I canât kill my self because it would kill my mother on the inside. Do I keep self medicating with pills and alcohol to keep myself going? Or do I take the plunge? Iâm scared and alone. "

But I am desperate. I might kill myself today. Loaded a 12 gauge shotgun with 00 buckshot and put it in my mouth earlier to see what it feels like. My heart raced, hands sweat, and I felt fear, as I do when I am close to killing myself. It would be easy to pull the trigger, I could almost do it on accident. But I'm scared to die. It may be too late for me."

"I'm close to edge Alot of things have been going on in my life and it's like everytime I start to bounce back from my suffering something comes along and fucking kicks me right in the balls, like seriously why do I exist if I'm just here to suffer no matter what I do, I know its pretty cause there is people out there starving and homeless and who have lost loved ones but seriously why is everything in my life completely and utterly fucked, I  have approached my parents about my constant anxiety and depression and u wanna know what they fucking say ""Everyone feels like that at ur age, it'll pass"", it wont fucking pass cause I've been like this for six fucking years, fuck sake, things were starting to get good as well, I asked out a girl she said yes, then 2 weeks later she breaks up with me then I approach another girl who I absolutely love to fucking pieces and she airs me, literally didnt even say anything just ignored the fact that I said that I love her, honestly I'm fucking finished with life now, the only thing from stopping me from grabbing a rope and ending it is my fear of death and thank fuck I have that."

"I don't have any rights, any control over my lifeI'm 13 years old and I have no control of anything. I might live in America which people call a free country but that's a joke. Because if you're not 18, you have no rights at all.

I'm a mtf transgender girl. And I'll never be able to act on it until I'm 18. And sadly, I'll never see 18. My parents force me to get monthly haircuts. They push Christianity on me and say that my thoughts are from the Devil.

I asked them if they would rather have a dead son or a living daughter. They replied by guilting me and calling me selfish. They said that if I killed myself I would go to hell. Well, I'm going to do it.

And I know my grave will have my birth name on it. But I'm tired of living and having no freedom whatsoever. So let this message show who I really am.

"Gave Up Everything For One Girl Then She Fucked Me Over, Itâs The Worst Feeling Ever!She is the perfect one. We got on really well. We accepted each other. We could talk about anything. We could do anything. I thought she was the one for me.

I know her since a year. There were two other girls I talked to. One of them wanted to be my girlfriend. Guess what I threw them away for one girl. 

She doesnât want to talk to or see me anymore. At our last meeting I kissed her. She liked it, but the next day she said she didnât want it to happen and now she doesnât talk to me. Wonât pick up the phone or anything. I spent a lot of money on her and it wasnât that I expected anything back. I did it, because I love her. Turns out she doesnât love me back. 

That night was the best night. All I can do now is be sad and think about how foolish I was to throw away two girl friends for her. 

Iâm left alone. I was the kind person and now Iâm fucked over. I want to die so fuckinâ bad every day Iâm feeling crappy. Whenever I fall in love I always get fucked over. This is the fourth time. Iâm tired of this shit."
"I almost died today. I WANT TO KEEP LIVING AND SO DO YOU.Hello reddit. Today I almost died. I'm still in quite a shock, but I believe I must share what I learned with you all.
Sorry for the wall of text, but do read my story, I hope it may help you somehow.

Long story short about my past:
I was a cutter from 13 to 16. Back then all I wanted was to die, but didn't have the guts to do it. Of course, when I was 16 years old I cut myself severely and after a while I decided that, even though my life had many problems, cutting and thinking about death wouldn't solve anything.

All this time I had a very dedicated psychologist. She helped me through all the process.
A year ago, 21 years old, I went through a very traumatic experience and I simply wasn't coping with it. After some time my psychologist decided I should see a shrink to get me on meds.
I did as she said and it wasn't too long until I went back to cutting.
The problem, however, was that this time I REALLY wanted to kill myself. I overdosed while drunk twice, I was also taken to the hospital due to severe cutting (that night especially I didn't think anyone would find me... I wanted to bleed to death, but anyway... doesn't matter), etc etc etc...
I was on the verge (and still am) of being institutionalized due to this behavior.

I've been thinking about killing myself for a long time now. The only reason that keeps me going is my mother. I lived just not to break her heart.

----

SO TODAY I was mad at absolutely everything over some really stupid shit. I was supposed to meet my best friend but texted him to cancel it, since I wasn't in the mood. I was going to buy a new razor and cut myself again.
My best friend called me before reading the text, saying he was already on his way to meet me so I decided to go, warning him I was in a really bad mood.

We eventually got drunk. He really cheered me up, so I decided I would be on my way home, have dinner and go to bed... again to wait for ANOTHER POINTLESS DAY... How lame...

So we were on our way home and, in our drunk wisdom, we thought it was a GREAT idea to take a walk in a pontoon (a floating dock, wtv) by the river (a very disgusting and smelly one, by the way).

We were drunk. It was dark. It was cold (yeah, it's winter). There were barely no lights. I remember reading a sign saying something like ""warning, don't cross, danger of falling in the river"". I thought to myself ""yeah, right!""

So we were in the middle, I notice I was getting off balance, so I turned back to be in balance again. There were pretty big spaces between the steps, but I never thought they would be enough for me to fall in the water... in fact... I thought if I fell there would be some kind of platform before reaching the water. YEAH RIGHT.

I fell.
I was underwater for about... ten seconds(?)... but it seemed like hours... I can't even describe.
I didn't really understand what was going on, neither had I any sense whether I was upside down or not. The only thing I realized was that I was going down fast and that I wanted to swim up.
That was the only thing I cared about. I wanted to go up up up up!!!

So finally I see my friend, hanging like a monkey or something, trying desperately to save me. I had two books in my hands and I think he told me to forget about them. No way sir, books must be saved. I threw the books as far as I could so they could reach safe ground and then came the hardest part... Me getting out of there.

I was really deep. There was NO ONE around: NO ONE. I was losing strength, my friend tried to pull me up and I hit with my head twice on that damned dock and fell again.
At this point he thought I was giving up, so he kept insisting that I had to be strong, to hold his hand, to keep trying.
I wasn't giving up. I was of course just half awake, losing my grip, but never did giving up passed through my mind. I just needed to calm down and get a grip.
So I finally get enough strength to get my legs on a little step and my friend did the rest. Pulled me and I was finally safe.

I was dizzy. I wasn't sure of what I was feeling. Now I know. I realized: I don't want to die.
I could have died. My friend could have not been able to help me, there was no one around, it was dark, it was cold, I didn't even know what was going on.
When I realized I lived... Guys, I mean it.... I don't want to die anymore.
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter how much you suffer. There is nothing as pointless as a ridiculous death. You may think you are unworthy, unloved, living a pointless life,... Well, maybe you are going through some tough shit and believe me, I know what you feel like.

But understand when I tell you this:
When you are about to die the only thing that goes through your head is living. If you are thinking about taking your life right now remember this. You will want to live. BELIEVE ME: YOU WILL! All of us want to live even if we don't know it. When the time comes... earlier than what it should... all you want is to live another day, see another sunset, smile at someone you love.

Guys, don't do it. No matter how hard it is, there is always a way. For me, as ridiculous as it can be, this incident made me realize how much I actually love my life and the ones in it.

It is worth it :) Be strong people!

With love."

"Job Search SuicideI canât find a job. Iâm stuck at a job I hate. Everyone is friends with the boss, but me. I canât get any decent kind of hours or money. I have to work 3rd shift. Iâm bipolar and canât even begin to manage my meds.

I live in Gso, NC. I have no family, I canât afford to move. I have no car. I have no drivers license.

I had a decent job a few years ago but left because I was getting bullied (black guy in a majority Hispanic factory)

I graduated from university with a 3.5 but I canât get a job remotely in my field.

Since then Iâve been homeless, I have a place now but all my little money goes to bills. Iâm in several programs that say theyâll help but Iâve been unable to find a better job.

I really want to just kill myself. I canât handle feeling isolated. I canât handle failing at everything in life. I JUST DONT HAVE A SOCIAL NETWORK TO GET MY FOOT IN THE DOOR.

Iâve survived 3+ suicide attempts AND Iâm always back in this position. I DONT WANT TO HEAR ANY BULLSHIT JOB ADVICE. 

I DONT HAVE ANYONE THAT WILL MISS ME OR BE IMPACTED BY MY SUICIDE. I spent my childhood poor. I thought education would change my life - but it only made me more self conscious.

Hopefully Iâll be dead soon. I definitely have a plan."
"You know how I knowThat my life is worthless and no longer worth living? 
One, I absolutely loved cooking and baking my entire life. The last year has completely taken that away from me. I don't have the money for a place to live let alone food.
I have no desire to lift a finger to cook anything anymore. I used to feel great preparing my kids delicious and really healthy meals every single day, every single meal. Right now, I don't remember the last time they had something I wouldn't normally consider crap.
All I think about is killing myself. I have completely detached from my children who I used to love so much. Now I look at them and I don't feel anything. I still want what is best for them, but I just don't feel anything. 
Having worked my whole life for everything I had and asking my friend to store it for me until I found a place turned out to be a mistake. He ruined everything in less than a month. Literally everything I owned is now trash you see out at most garage sales. Now, if I ever do find another place I have to start completely over. Shit that took me 15 years to get is going to take another 15 years of my life to build up.
I have not been patient with my kids. Homelessness is destroying who I was. I feel sorry for them but no matter how hard I try I can't treat them right anymore. I want to die for their sake. I don't want to affect their mental health for their entire lives because of this. 
All I want is a place to live. Is working two jobs not enough? When did literally killing yourself working become not good enough to have a home? I guess I'll never be good enough. I can't do this any more. I am literally killing myself trying to get somewhere and am getting no where at all. Everyday seems to just get worse.
I used to want the least painful way to die, but now, want the most painful thing I can possibly put myself through. I apparently deserve this."
For once I don't have work I finally don't have more work to do normally I'll work from the time I get home till I go to bed and honestly now that I don't I really don't know what to do. Basically I'm very bored what should I do

"I have an inferiority complexI have a severe inferiority complex. I've had it for almost 3 years now, and it's cost me pretty much everything. It started with me losing my best friend because I was a belligerent asshole, then changing my behavior completely and trying to become someone I'm not (specifically, someone with empathy and humility), and then meeting new people that made me revert to my old personality. I've never been a good person, and I'm not just saying that, if you saw the things I did behind closed doors you'd beat the shit out of me. I've blackmailed people to get them to keep talking to me, stole people's social media passwords to see what they were saying about me and conspired with other groups of people to get back at those who ""betrayed"" me, even if their betrayal was completely justified. I am the most pathetic, genuinely disgusting person I've ever met, and because of recent events I was just reminded of that. My friend group has cut me off, and like last time it stings really bad. They stopped talking to me because I was jealous of my best friend spending time with someone that disliked me, someone whose presence I hated so much I tried to stir up shit to make them hate each other. Once my grand scheme was found out they stopped talking to me. That was it. I'm blocked on social media, I can't send texts, and if I approached them in real life they'd probably call the cops. So here we go, once again, I'm all alone and have to meet new people so the cycle can repeat. 

I think the term ""antisocial extrovert"" fits me perfectly. Not because I avoid socialization, but because I end up completely ignoring the norms, which results in a majority of people not being able to stand me. I always end up making friends that share my traits, and our friendship is toxic as a result. It always ends the same way, too; they do something that pisses me off, I do something in response, they cut me off and I go full stalker mode and try to fuck them over in whatever way possible. It's going to happen now, it's going to happen in the future, it probably won't stop until someone kills me or I kill myself. I am dependent on other people but I can't respect their feelings, and if I try to change that I'll just get bored and go back. 

Fuck my life."
They say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problemsI don't feel like these are temporary problems anymore. I have a problem with the nature of reality and that's not something that goes away. 
"Is choking to death viable?I donât have many options and ways of dying right now other than that but I donât really have anywhere I can hang myself, so would tying my neck tight enough to pass out and die work?

"how do i quit my job Last month i was unemployed and happy now i have a job and unhappy.

"I don't wanna kill myself, but do.I want to be done with everything but I don't wanna put those around me through a suicide. I honestly don't have much more to say than that at the moment, and I kinda wish I could be more grandiose but that's it; I wanna kill myself but don't wanna have the consequences."
"I want my life to change... because I can't live this anymoreI am in an abusive relationship that I stay in because I always make excuses for him.  I had only my friends left, who I had doubted really cared about me, and today it was kind of confirmed they don't even like me and I think have been humoring me as to not hurt my feelings.


I apparently have no social skills.  I get a friend and I am willing to do anything for that friend but have absolutely no idea how to read their signals.  This is one thing that pisses my boyfriend off too.  Because of this I end up doing harmless things that end up pissing people off, and i can never tell they are angry.   I apparently ruined all of my friendships by doing this, and only found out today.  Of course I was too stupid and oblivious to even realize there had been problems taht started about a year ago.  I judt had no clue.  I was really blindsided by this information.  


I don't have any family but my mother.  She has no friends, no family, nothing, even my sister has disowned her and i am the only one still in contact with her.  she has munchausen by proxy and has... well... things were rough growing up.  When I am in her life I am enabling her, when I'm out of it she has literally no one and starts talking about suicide.


So today I came to the realization I have no one really.  you know 5, 6 years ago I knew I was a social idiot but I thought I had changed.  I guess not.  I don't have much hope for myself at this point.  "

"Justifiable SufferingHow long does on have to suffer before society says it is acceptable to die?

I've done my part by reaching out and trying to get better only to be shat upon each and every time. 

I will not be opening up to people again. Vulnerability is only exploited against me. It is a weakness.

People do not want to help. They just don't want to be exposed to the negativity of someone's suicide. They think only of themselves, especially in our unhealthy hyperindividualistic society of today.

So, how long will you let others suffer so that you do not have to feel bad?"

"If THIS is what kills me, at least I can die laughingSo ... I accidentally stabbed myself with a pen a few minutes ago, and while I don't *think* I hit an artery, it did bleed a lot.  I excused myself as nonchalantly as I could, shoved some paper towels against the wound, had a ~~good~~ godawful cry in the bathroom about the circumstances leading to the stabbing, slapped myself around for good measure, and limped back to work.  It hurts like a motherfucker, and there's a good chance I'll get an infection from this, but I'm not about to see a doctor because, frankly, I deserve to die if this is what kills me.

"So let me tell you a story that happened on a public survival minecraft server So it was around 5 years ago and i went to my best friends house, and as always we fired up minecraft and went into a server, me and my friend used to live near each other but my home was a storage to keep our stuff, not really a home

and also we were the richest people in the server with the biggest house in thee whole server,

so the server is a non-pvp survival server, but i found a way to kill people , there was a glitch that allowed you to hurt players that teleport to you by request in the nether roof,

so i did the nether roof glitch and i got over the roof and i spammed the chat saying that i found something super amazing on the nether roof, so someone requests a teleport, and i accept.

since he had a bad internet connection it took a long time for him to load in, so we killed him

he had A LOT OF expensive stuff, a whole lot of goodies

and even un obtainable items in the game that you had to purchase with real money

so i took the stuff and teleported myself to home so he couldnt kill me when he used /back

so he started begging in the chat telling me to give his stuff back and ...

and we had a good reputation in the server and we didnt want to ruin it, so i said it was my cousins fault because he was playing at that moment (i was lying)

so i tell him to tp back to me so i can give his stuff back

(he was gearing up because he thought we were still on the nether roof)

but also i knew another glitch for killing players in the non pvp server too

if you are in a claimed by player section but you are trusted in that claimed section you can set fire to other players but they cant hurt or set fire to you,

so we all know what happens next,

i accept the teleport request and he tps into my friends house and since he has a bad internet connection we set fire to him,

and he was geared up with god level full diamond pack and a whole lot on music discs for some reason

music discs were really really expensive and hard to find and god level enchantments are bought using real money

so after killing him we quickly spam the chat saying that it was my other cousin that did that

and we quickly left the server, but he did alert the admins but the admins told him that its his fault and he shouldnt have done that

so here is the stuff i got by memory

\*249 Diamonds

\*320 Emeralds

\* A whole lot of very expensive discs

\*lottery cards (more on that later)

\*premium vote cards

\*576 cacti

\*Around 200 Diamond blocks

\*Three sets of god armor, half used and one brand new

\*64 Gold blocks

\*God level chest keys

\*leather armor

\*A whole lot of iron ore

\*God level enchantment books ( i think there were 7 of them )

\*128 Cooked beef

\*Instant health potion

\*\*A lottery card is a paid and one use item used in that server were you could win the lottery and get a lot of good stuff or outright lose your money

\*\*Vote cards and Vote keys do the same but you will 100% get something and they are more expensive and the highest level prize is worse compared to the lottery card

i have a lot more stories like this, if you are interested i will post more of these stories"

"A little venting I'll try to not make it longMy name is Bryce, I feel like that makes me more comfortable that you all know. I've been struggling with diagnosed depression since 8th grade (I'm a high school junior now). Life has been so great this school year, found a boy I like, averaged a 4.3 GPA last quarter. I love my friends and my band family. Taking 4 AP classes I love. Seeking help for my mental health. About a month ago I started cutting and started burning. In my second period class, someone asked me about how the hand sanitizer+lighter trick worked. I showed them(This was one of the ways I would burn myself) someone was recording me and I got called to the principal's office and now my expulsion is in the process because I committed arson. when my mom dropped me off at home. the first thing I did was grab my Zoloft pills and took about 30 of them.

About five hours later I was throwing them up and was hallucinating. I didn't do my research I guess because overdosing is actually really hard. I spent two days recovering from that. I tied a simple noose to my doorknob and am looking to try again tonight. Made a program to upload a tweet with a google doc that's my suicide note. I tagged one of my friends so it will spread to my other friends. Looking to make a convo before I do it 2nite."

"Considering suicide more out of laziness than despair. More and more, I feel like I'm just not cut out to be an adult. 

I'm 28 years old. I'm mostly self-sufficient. I've got a job pays decently well (though I have to do freelance and will probably need a third job on top of that), I live in my own apartment, I cook for myself, and mainly do all the things people are supposed to do in order to maintain their lives. 

It's soul crushing. I've already made the decision that if I were suddenly to find myself in a life threatening situation, I wouldn't fight it. I want a bus to careen off the road and hit me. I want to be struck by lightning. I want to have a sudden, fatal heart attack. I want to just not have to be alive anymore. 

Everything costs money. Food costs money. Rent costs money. Electricity costs money. The simple act of being alive, it seems, costs money. Being alive, living, is an effort. A huge effort. It's not a default state but something that must be consciously maintained. You have to eat. You have to have shelter. You have to go to the dentist. You 
have to go to the doctor. And these all take time and cost money. There are no alternatives. Capitalism won the Cold War. This is society. This is the way things are done. This is LIFE. 

And Communism was no walk in the park either, at any rate. 

We work to get money. We wake up. Brush our teeth. Put on a tie, unless it's casual Friday. Run to catch the train. Elbow some guy in the gut because there's not a lot of room and you need your 1.5x1.5 square. We get to work. Get our coffee. Do something we hate. Something that goes completely and utterly against our principles. It's like a Jew working at a pork processing plant. But the money's good. You're not in college anymore. It's time to put all that idealism away. It's time to be an adult. You're not getting any younger. Do this. All day. Every day. Until you die. 

Life is full of worries. That project needs to be completed by Friday. That freelance assignment needs to be done by Monday. You've got to call the exterminator and get these silverfish out of your bathroom. And these are just your immediate worries. Meanwhile, oppression is happening on a mass scale all over the world. You directly benefit from it. In fact, part of your job is contributing to it. In a small part. But still a part. How did this happen? How did this become your life? 

Other people deal with it. You're not so self absorbed as to think that you're the only one suffering. You're not so naive to think you have it so bad. You live in a first world nation. You can get clean water whenever you want. You eat every day. You're comparatively healthy (though, you do smoke a lot...) What makes you different? Why can't you just accept what millions, billions, already accept? Why can't you just work for a living and like it? You entitled little shit. You're exactly what's wrong with America. Everyone works. You hate your job? So does every god damn fucking person in the world. THEY don't wanna die. Why do you? 

Because it's like a light switch going off in your head. One minute you're here. The next you're not. And all your problems vanish. You vanish. It doesn't matter that you've worked as hard as you can but you can't complete that project. It doesn't matter that your freelance assignments have dried up. It doesn't matter that you need to find a third god damn job on top of the two you already have. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters. Because you're dead. You don't have to worry about anything. Life is no longer happening to you. There's no need for decisions. No need for stress. No need for work. There's not even a need for a burial plot -- you don't care what happens to your body. Let some necrophiliac carve your corpse full of brand new orifices for all you care. 

You don't have to worry. About anything. 

Change jobs? God, even MORE fucking work. Sure, you can do it, but it's so much effort. Scouring jobs boards, going to networking events, writing cover letters, it's all so much much work. And you'll still be miserable. It's not the specific job. It's jobs in general. It's life in general. It's responsibilities in general. There will always be something that grinds you into dust. One leg gets tired, so you shift your weight until the other leg gets tired and then you shift your weight again over and over and over. I just want to sit down, but everyone else is standing. I'm just fucking lazy. Things that come easy to others is an arduous task for me. Getting out of bed, even, depresses me because I know it will be yet another day full of soul crushing responsibility. I'm not so entitled to think I deserve to not have to do with every god damned person does. But, still, I'd really rather not. I don't want to have to take care of myself. I don't want other people to take care of me. 

So: death. 

I don't know what, exactly, I hope to accomplish by this post. I only intended to write a paragraph or two and everything just came pouring out. I've been thinking these thoughts for years. I've never shared them with anyone. To outside observers, I'm the most cheerful fucking guy in the world. But I'm rotting like a soft log in a shallow pond, from the inside out. And one day. I'll split. 

tl;dr -- life is too much effort to maintain, so I've been considering giving it up. "

"I don't feel safe being alone.The only thing keeping me from going and killing myself is how numb I am feeling. But I can feel my anxiety start to go up and the panic coming.

"Feel like my life's over before it even startedI'll start off by explaining the title: I'm pretty young (under 18; I don't feel comfortable with giving out my real age in case somebody recognizes this) and I feel like my life is completely fucked before I've even had the chance to really experience it.

I'm homeschooled and I really hate it. I'm not smart like a lot of you guys and I have difficulty understanding the material, not to mention the fact that I can't concentrate for shit. I've got exams soon and I'm almost positive that I'm going to fail most of them.

I've tried speaking to my mom (dad ran off somewhere, haha) about it but whenever somebody tries to have a serious discussion with her, she tries to make it a game, or just simply puts it off. She's a really wonderful person but her attitude towards anything remotely negative that needs to be sorted out is infuriating. I love her but I'm finding it difficult not to resent her at the moment.

I don't really have any friends either. I've got a few people I know online and they're really nice, but online friendships aren't the same. I have a real life friend but his dad's job requires him to move a lot, so I only see him once or twice a year.

I'm sorry if this sounds stupid. Maybe I'm just a whiny bitch, which would be fucking typical of me. I know there're people much worse off but I just feel like such absolute crap at the moment."

Hope your proud of me dudes!"
"Spending the next week as my lastI don't really know where to start besides that I should have been dead almost two years ago and due to unforseen circumstances my life was inadvertantly saved. I apologise if it's very jumbled. I just have a lot of thoughts right now and that's all this really is. For now.

 About two years ago I had gotten back from a deployment and about the last couple months of it, I started to feel really depressed. Nothing I used to like to do was any fun or held any substance for me anymore. Working out, doing anything I used to love to do. It was out of nowhere really. The day I got back I saw my wife waiting there in the rain for me and she was so excited to see me, jumped on me and hugged me yada yada. I didn't feel much though. No excitement, nothing. Well this continued on and I had lost all my drive for anything, work, play etc. I lost all motivation. Anyways a little ways down the road my wife lost her father and things changed between us. A couple months later, for 13 days (I counted) she wouldn't even give me the time of day. Wouldn't talk to me, acknowledge me and was all around apprehensive to be around me. Then one night she just asks me if I still loved her and was happy in the marriage. I said yes of course, and I honestly was and still wanted to be with her, but her answer was opposite of course. 
   
So fast forward and we split, soon thereafter I went to an advanced course for my job, Sapper Leaders. I had wanted to go on that course so bad for so long but not this time. I was still unmotivated to do anything but I did my best and I earned my castle after that grueling course, one of only 8 people out of a class that had started with 40 something. Nonetheless I was still unhappy. That same night I had gotten home and was prepared to off myself with the shotgun that was in my bedroom. Well come to find out, she took it with her to where she moved while I was at the course. So I didn't do it. I decided to see what happens for a while and maybe I'd decide I want to keep living idk. Well my life took a turn for the worse. I became a very bad alcoholic. I drank every single night, from the moment I got off work until 3 AM and would wake up at 4 AM to go to work still hammered. That turned into me totaling multiple vehicles from drunk driving and one DUI. I would blackout multiple times a week and do nothing but go to the bar, play pool and drink my nights away. Hooking up with random females and barely remembering my days. All while I was still active duty. 

 My command could tell I was having problems but only one person out of them bothered to try to help me. Which nothing came of the help because I was basically told by a Psychiatrist that I was beyond help because I didn't know what caused my depression at the start and the divorce only worsened what I was already feeling. So this continued until I got that 1 DUI and I was put into a 5 week rehab program. Didn't drink a single drop that whole time, and nothing changed. I was still sad and didn't want to live. Still unmotivated to do my job, to teach my juniors anything even though I was one of the best ones in the platoon for it. Anyways, after the 5 weeks I was still on restriction (can't leave the barracks and have to report every two hours to the officer of the day until 10 PM, starting at 6 AM). I decided fuck it, I hadn't drank for 45 days and only had 15 days left of restriction, I'm gonna break restriction tonight and go have a few drinks and be back before 6 AM ready to go. Bad move, I ended up so hammered that I broke into a ford dealership just down the road, destroyed some shit and fell asleep in their garage. Woke up to some officers asking if I knew where I was at. I didn't, they arrested me and told me what I did and saw the video. I had no memory of it, still don't. 
  Anyways I bailed myself out of jail and was discharged within the next week, at my original discharge date and honorably still at that. I was lucky and my command did not take action against me for any of it. I stayed around the same town and kept going out. I ended up hooking up with one girl I had my eye on for a while. We were together for a couple of months and I swear I had never been happier in my life. She's perfect, gorgeous and so much fun. She matches my energy so well. Yet, I had decided that I wanted to move. Only 3 hours away though so I figured I could go see her throughout the week and we could stay together. That was not the case, she decided she didn't want that and blocked me on everything. There I was heartbroken again. 

 That one really did a number on me. I had moved and I stopped drinking all together. This is now more recent. This all happened over the span of less than two years, from separating from my wife to now. I moved to VA with a friend of mine and did my thing there for a bit. Still unhappy with how things are. I then started seeing another girl from the previous city that I lived in and would go see her now and then, we weren't official but I liked her a lot. She recently moved and I went to see her. Things weren't the same though, she was very apprehensive around me and the energy was totally off. Kind of felt like negative energy towards me. So I left the very next day. I then decided that on my way back that I would take a little vacation for myself and see what's out there in the other states. I stayed in Arkansas for a few days, went to some state park and it was beautiful. Did some partying, just living it up. Stayed somewhere in Illinois for a night too. I decided that it's my last ditch effort to try to have some fun again. Before I go. 

Here's what I haven't really said. Any time I go out, I usually go out alone. I do a lot of things alone, always have. Go to the bar, strip club whatever. Out to eat, alone, anything I do is usually by myself. I do have friends and always did so I'm not your usual loner. I actually prefer to do things by myself, I don't really know why. I'm usually pretty private and keep a lot of things to myself and I always have, always will. I would go out with friends here and there because it does get lonely sometimes always going by myself but at the same time, any time I would go with my friends it was always me asking them and not them asking me. With an acception of 2  people who would ask me here and there as well. I find that I would meet a lot more people and make some good acquaintances when I would be by myself. It was fun for me. I do get tired of not being thought of though. It has always been like that, I'm always the first to text or check on someone, or see if they want to hang out. It sucks. I'm more of a popular loner, I know a ton of people and we're all cool with each other and hangout when I'm around but no one hits me up when I'm gone. 

   Anyways I've been hurting for the past two years, and should have been dead so many times Idek anymore. Around 6, but every time I walk away from said situations without a scratch. Like the luckiest unlucky person that I know. I've caused myself so much pain and I'm tired of not enjoying anything anymore. Not like I would have time to enjoy anything if I did because I'm probably going back to jail soon because of what I did the last time I was blackout drunk, breaking into that dealership. For some reason I thought I might have enjoyed life if I stayed alive to see what happened but I've done nothing but wreak havoc on my own life and cause a lot of pain, isolation and loneliness. Even without drinking I still do have very bad self damaging habits. I don't enjoy life anymore and to be honest it is very underwhelming and boring to me. Nothing really excites me anymore or satisfies me. I can't even be satisficed (The idea that something isn't exactly satisfying but also not unsatisfying). I find no substance in my life and I feel like I have nothing left to offer the world nor does it to me. I just want to be gone. I just want some peace, to get out of my own head. I don't really have a reason to be here anymore and I'm tired of being a nuisance not only to myself but others too. I figure this will be my last week here, and I'll enjoy what I can. 

Sorry for being so long."
"who cares?if i killed myself right now, which i absolutely could, what would it matter? iâm a horrible mother and i deserve to die anyways. every morning i wake up and immediately cry that i have to do this shit all over again. i hate it. i hate everything!! i donât want to be here. i feel like my mental illness has won, iâm just a shell of the person i used to be. all i think about is dying and different ways of killing myself. i canât even think positive anymore. i want out."
"What to expect from a suicide hotline?Hi, I don't know if this is the place to post this, but I've been feeling particularly bad lately. More so than usual. I've though of calling a hotline but when I do, I'm in such a bad shape I wouldn't even know what to say. It's difficult to explain being depressed for seemingly trivial or imagined reasons, and I always feel like it would just be me crying drunk on the phone. At this point, I'm just thinking it would be easier to go through with it."

"Deal for a life timeAnyone else make deals with themselves? I don't know if this is just me. 

Some background: I've never have kissed anyone, been on any kind of date, or experienced any love from people who weren't family. I guess this makes mean insel or how ever you spell it. 

I've felt alone for such a long time that o couldn't handle it and I started to genuinely figure out how I would finally end it. One of my friends found out and talked me down. It's still just as bad as before but now all I can think about was how sad everyone would be if I was gone. I also recognized that my lack of romantic connection was particularly my fault. 

So I made a deal with myself that if o don't have a successful date my the time I'm 25 I'll get to off myself. On the condition I actually have to try. So I'm actively on dateing sites and doing my best to make good first impressions.  

So has anyone else done this or am I just crazy?"

"This might be the last thing anyone ever sees from me.Where to begin, I'm some 20 something Hispanic guy that lives in the New York New Jersey area. 

I grew up rather poor. 

I grew up somewhat alone. I mean I had friends but I never had much of a family to speak of. My mom is a very cold and damaged woman. She was a bit warmer at one point but only when it was easy. My dad was even worse off emotionally speaking, due to scars from his childhood.
Emotionally speaking I've mostly been alone I've never been very good about broaching these topics.

I'm a failure. 

This would be easier to stomach if I could say I were stupid. But I can't because I got accepted and went to some smart highschool(less than 10 from my student body got in). I got an 1800 back when max was 2400 on the SAT having never studied for it or for much of anything. Mine is a story of disappointing people, my teachers, myself. Academically all I've ever done was coast by. In the sense that I've always done the minimum.

Maybe I could make the excuse I were poor. That one is somewhat flimsy in some ways. Sure it is true I grew poor. But that highschool was a real opportunity. I essentially get paid to go community college. 

I have a therapist who tried their best. Can any therapist really replace the people who should've been there as I grew. The people who are supposed to guide and nurture. If you heard some of the stuff they told me as I grew HAH.

My point is I harbor a deep resentment for what my existence was compared to what I feel it could've been. Maybe I'm just weak I've seen some do more with comparatively similar financial and possibly familial situations. 

My mantra after all this is ""no one cares"". If you had a chance to save someone what would you do? What would you give?  The answer to me is nothing. Everyone has their own lives, their own problems. 
How can anyone afford to care in this world? Why would they stick their neck out like that? Most would rightly call them foolish. 

My current existence is that of a leech and I can't bear it any longer. I had a job once worked at it for nearly a year but I didn't like trying to trick people to get stuff they didn't need.

I actually intended to end it yesterday but turns out the place I needed closes at night. So I went to some hotel to think for a bit and try again tomorrow.

Anyway I don't know what I hope to gain from this post. Maybe an opportunity, maybe some words as empty as they are, maybe a hand. I guess I just tire of the struggle. What am I fighting for? Myself?

My phone is getting somewhat low and I have no charger since this was kind of spur of the moment. So I'll check on this in some hours.

"I think I have literally 0 best friends including the internet now. We haven't talked in weeks and we keep saying we're going to talk and we never doI haven't had an IRL best friend for about a year and a half now. Ruined that one by saying she was my ""favorite person"" more than once while she had a boyfriend. I realize now that's probably even heavier than telling someone you love them. Even though I would've been fine with having them as a friend I really felt I wanted to let her know just how much I appreciated her. Like this chick was the first person to prove to me again and again that she legitimately liked being around me and liked having me as a friend. Even though she had plenty of other friends she legit liked hanging out with me and no one has even done that before. There are people I THOUGHT had done this but then later turns out that wasn't true but of course I still tried to be their friend and follow them around all the time and probably be annoying. Of course there are people at work that I don't dislike but right now that's about it. Just people I kind of don't dislike and tolerate.

Anyone who says internet friends aren't real friends are so fucking wrong. But we never follow through on voicechatting anymore. Like someone will say like for instance today it was ""hey lets voicechat tomorrow at 7:30"" and every time I would build my whole schedule and everything I'm doing after work to fit that time and they just dont respond when I ping them or say they're busy now. Jesus god fuck I am so goddamn lonely and desperate to have a conversation with someone I actually want to talk to. Having someone like the person I knew a year ago would be a fucking miracle right now. Like if I actually met and knew them in real life but I really don't think that could ever happen again and I fucked it up."

"BLM needs to focus on black on black crime more than it has 
Iâm as Liberal as can be, but BLM needs to focus on black on black crime big time.

The stuff theyâve already done is amazing. Theyâve already defunded a few police departments, and are pushing for what is right, but by far the biggest problem is black on black crime.

[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/US/black-black-crime-loaded-controversial-phrase-heard-amid/story%3fid=72051613)


Many children live in impoverished hoods in large cities. They need to push to fund the families in those hoods and be able to support them. Many people in that place canât see any way out besides selling drugs, and with that comes violence and corruption. BLM and really everyone needs to work to end that relentless cycle in the hood and urban areas. Itâs the main reason for black on black crime, which is by far the cause of most murders.

Donât get me wrong. Most of the black communityâs problems are from white people. The way many modern US cities were designed were to keep white people in certain areas and black people in certain areas. You can guess which on got the worse area. Now those hoods are over-policed, and that leads to the infamous police brutality.

Another thing is, many âhoodâ areas are completely forgotten about by the government, and mayor of that city. They donât care about them. We need to care. They wonât reconstruct anything in these old neighborhoods, they wonât get people living in poverty in those neighborhoods the right social services.

Itâs horrible, and needs to be spoken of more."

But holy fuck I wish I had someone I could just call to sleep on a call together with. Idk why but its just such a nice thing."

"Just hit rockbottom from nowhere.Today my girlfriend (of only a little past two months) broke up with me. It was hard but you'd think something as short as that would be easy to deal with; however, it was the longest relationship I had managed to keep(pathetic I know). What's worse is I made the mistake of becoming a member of her friend group and now I can't even talk to them without feeling like I'm choking. I have almost no one to talk to since they were my only close friends and I've never felt so close to killing myself as I am now. I almost broke down today in the library when I thought I heard her voice... When I'm alone, I feel like there's a hole in my stomach, and the physical tension is almost unbearable at some times. I know others out there have it worse than I do, but I've never been in a darker place. I was once put into a psych ward for an attempt that I would've followed through with had my dad not been home. I'm currently a first year in college and have no one else. I can't even study for my coming midterm without breaking into tears and thinking about killing myself.
sorry for the rant."
"I'm really not sure why I'm bothering with life anymore.I hate myself, I don't even exist. 
I'm just a veneer of happiness over a body of depression.
never been diagnosed, don't think I need to be. I'm doing terrible at school and cant pass an exam for shit, I never used to fail exams. My friends are peeling off, I had a huge a argument with my parents tonight about what seems like nothing. There isn't a single aspect of my life I'm enjoying right now and I just want it to end.
I can't imagine how nice it would be not having to worry about all the shit in my life.

"I am all out of options.I graduated college in 2008 with a great well playing job. Made great connections and people were telling me I was ""going places"" it was a good time. In 2012, I get laid off and the company was cutting budgets. 2013, got laid off again. 

I was unemployed for a year looking for jobs, hitting up my connections, took an unpaid internship. Nothing. Nothing happened there were no jobs to be had, even as a receptionist. I had a break down and I went into therapy. It worked. Still went on interviews and I would come up as not exactly as what people wanted. Interviews would go well, great conversation about the job. I would back up my past experience.  Still nothing. I finally get a part time job working at a cafe. Nothing in my career. 

I said fuck this and moved to NY so I can have more opportunity. I've gotten a few things but nothing to pay the bills. My contacts all tell me the same thing, we like you but we have no open positions. I've been here for 6 months trying to change careers and I interview and I come up short everytime. I am never good enough and I don't know where to go from here. My connections will not talk to me, they all say they are worried about their jobs.  I am 31 and at this point I am only qualified for entry level where as a person I feel more than that. I don't portray that ""I am better than this"" in my interviews.  

I can not get a full time job. After therapists and job coaches I still can not get a job. At this point I see no other way out. I feel like I am worth more dead than I am alive and I feel like nothing that I do can change my situation. 

Now I am getting older and more and more further detached to the working world. My friends have no issues, but I cant and I just don't get it. They all tell me to ""keep trying"". Well I mean that has been my full time job for 3 years.

It's been 3 years since my layoffs and now I feel like I am at the point of no return that I am suppose to be jobless. But I need money to live."
"My fiancÃ© killed herself. I donât know what to do.I was always the one with thoughts. I talked about it a few times a week. I thought about it a lot. She never mentioned anything like it. One day I got back from work, and the bedroom door was locked. I had to break down the door, and I found her in our closet. No note. No anything. Just her. I donât know why. I donât know what happened. And now my entire life is gone. She didnât sign her will, so everything that we owned is going to her parents. Everything we bought together is gone. I had to move out because I canât be there anymore. I now live at my moms house with some random bed and a few things her family didnât take out of the apartment. Theyâre blaming me, and are doing everything they can to cut me out of their lives. Theyâre even trying to sue me for her engagement ring. I donât know how much longer I can do this. I need some help. I have a trauma therapist next week. I still have our dog. But Iâm gone. The me who I was is gone, other than the feelings I had before."

"Life is hardDo you ever just look in a mirror and feel disappointed with what you see? Thatâs me every time I stare at my reflection. I have a car, my own studio apartment, a job that pays well, a family that cares for me, friends who care for me, but yet I feel that I have nothing. Deep inside, thereâs an immense amount of worthlessness. Thereâs this emptiness so deep that thereâs nothing that could ever fill it. Itâs an abyss, a void, a vacuum that sucks all energy except those that are negative. My emptiness knows my weaknesses and it enjoys preying on it.

You have not saved a space for me or people like me in your hearts. You have believed the lie that everything is remedied. You refuse to look at my scars or, if you do, you do so nonchalantly. I want to die because I must not belong here in this timeline where the rest of you are happy and where my problems, my iniquities, and my shortcomings were created by my own hand. Look at who is still denied a seat at the dinner table. And then look again."

"Can a young person be really suicidal?This post was inspired by this exchange https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kfpjrv/what_are_the_conditions_for_not_feeling_finegood/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf .

Most calls for help here can be divided in two groups: the younger than 30 years old and the older. Both groups are capable of gulping too many pills, but Iâm wondering to what degree weâre observing very different situations. 

An 11 years old who wants to âkill herselfâ is in pain. The pain is overwhelming and her experience doesnât give her ways to find relief. There may not be relief. In any case, her focus on the pain of the moment makes the potential of a good future completely disappear from her option. So, ok, letâs tell her that we love her and try change her mind.

But a 50 years old is an adult. She went through multiple experiences, the death of her parents, the birth of her son, a good job, a good friendship, an abusive boss, a betrayal. The 50 years old knows what sheâs feeling, sheâs less likely influenced by a road rage episode from that morning. If she wants to die, she must know what sheâs saying.

If we really want to help, our attitude to responding to these two profiles must be very different. We could use white lies with the former, but we donât want to say bullsh*t to the latter and further destroy her already crumbling faith in humanity.

However, most of times, support comes only in the first form, like we were all 11 years old. Are we sure weâre not making more damage than benefit? Personally, with the second category, I believe that empathising is more useful than trying to change their mind. Sharing that Iâm suicidal, too, will make her feel less alone and think twice to her choice.

Any experts among the readers?

Thanks."
"Why does it really matterHey I probably wonât really ever come back to this but I just want a place to put how I feel. I feel like I just am a waste of space with no point in life. I feel like I canât ever really make friends and everyone hates me. I try to be nice and be generous but that seems to just get people to take advantage of me. What difference does it all make it the first place itâs not like it really matters Iâm just gonna end up dead anyhow. If Iâm going to end up dead eventually and my life will have no impact, then what is even the point of living it at all. "

"I know I need helpI've been dealing with depression since as long as I can remember. I was never a happy kid. Stuff happened when i was 15 that really messed me up, emotionally at least. My family life is all kinds of fucked up; and I feel myself ""losing"" more often then I care to admit to.

It's not even been 4 years since I was admitted to a Psychiatric hospital, and I can see what's happening now. It needs to end. 

To be super plain, I want to kill myself. I find my mind drifting to the ""how"" far more often in the last month. I'm not sure I've gone a day without thinking of at least one possibility. 

Can someone please help me. I am scared. I hate myself. I hate my depression, but more than all that.

"My last attempt triggered a psychosis. Turns out I have schizophrenia. Now what?After staying in a crappy Ukrainian hospital for a month I'm back home.

I don't have any friends, irl or online. I go for walks with my mom because going outside is supposed to be good for you. I'm trying to find work as a freelance audio engineer, but can't find clients.

"âdonât talk backâ is stupid Itâs not stupid in every situation. If a kid is being a outright rude, then I understand. Unfortunately though, parents (shitty ones) that use the âdonât talk backâ card when theyâre being a prick and want to get away with it are actively displaying crappy communication skills to their kids and itâs completely counter productive.

My grandmother is a light sleeper and my father has a pattern of being inconsiderate to all other people if he feels like it sometimes. Itâs definitely his main character flaw to say the least lmao. Anyways he was in the kitchen, slamming drawers and the microwave, and I asked him to try and be a little quieter so my nana doesnât wake up. This apparently was wrong? 

I was told that heâs gonna âdo whatever he wantsâ (keep in mind he doesnât pay rent, utilities, or much else for that matter cause itâs her house), and that Iâm a bitch for âtalking backâ after this and defending myself, anddd that as âhis childâ I cannot âdisrespectâ him. 

In my eyes, heâs the only one being disrespectful, to my grandmother and to me lmao. I donât get it. Why are some parents just on a power trip and want to use this card? Itâs infuriating."

"I've never tried to make more of myself, only lessI keep my stuff to a minimum. I try to have as little effect on the world as possible. I push away friends and deliberately alienate new people I meet. I live my life like a ghost. I once spent nearly a month using only the words 'hello' 'goodbye' 'yes' 'no' 'sure' and 'thanks' and nobody noticed anything weird about that. 

For a while I physically tried to make less of myself. I was bulimic for six years and no one knew until I'd been in recovery for two. 

I do everything I can to reduce the impact of my existence in an effort to reduce the impact of my inevitable non-existence. I might as well already be dead. Nothing would change. 

I only have two reasons I haven't yet. One, no one would look after my pet. Two, I don't want to traumatize whoever will find my body. I've been playing with the idea of a time delayed text message so that EMS can whisk it away without anyone having to see.

"I feel so stupidUp until a few months ago I [25] had never loved another person in a romantic sense. I had gone on a few dates, but never actually dated someone in any serious fashion. I ended up befriending a woman online about 7 months and it progressed to her admitting she was falling for me. I was naive and inexperienced and after a while I began to feel the same feelings that she had. We would spend hours together every night on skype, watching documentaries or learning about each other. She turned into the best part of my day. I couldn't wait to wake up and read what she had texted me while I was sleeping. It was like a little present every morning. She was visiting her parents nearby after we had been dating online for 5-6 months and she really wanted to see me. She ended up visiting me 3 different times during her trip and sleeping over twice. We meshed so well together, I have NEVER felt more comfortable around another human being. Not even my family. After returning all she could talk about was how amazing the trip was, and how much she loved me. Again we'd spend our nights talking to each other, about our childhoods and dreams, about music and art and food. I could talk to her forever about anything. I wanted to see her again so badly that we worked out a great time for her to visit a month after her first time seeing me in real life. I flew her out to my place again and we spent 4 amazing days together. We hiked and cooked and made love. We would spend hours in bed just wrapped up in each others embrace. I have never felt that level of intimacy with anyone. It took a good deal of effort for her to pull herself off me and board her flight home. After she gets home shes incredibly distant. She tells me that she spent 3 days in her room just burned out on human interaction, not wanting to even see her roommates. Every night shes too tired to skype, or has plans. I sense something is wrong so I confronted her about it. She says after she got home she felt like she didn't love me anymore. That she had ""OD'd"" on me during our trip. She explained that she had hoped her feelings would return to normal but two weeks later theres no change. It was like a fucking light switch. I don't understand the chain of events that went into play. How can someone do a complete 180 turn on me in the span of a day? It's really been weighing on my self-esteem how someone could just throw me away like that. At what point in the future is the next person I love going to do the same? I just keep analyzing it in my head, what I did or didn't do, if I was too boring, if I wasn't funny or charming enough. I can't understand why she doesn't love me anymore. I'm starting to fear that I have fallen down into a place I don't have the strength to pull myself out of."

When I'm surrounded with other people at school I feel like I'm just being awkward, not talking to anyone, and even if someone talks to me I just wanna be alone because I'm afraid my awkwardness will mess up all my interactions. Sometimes the only two solutions I see are either totally isolating myself from the society or suicide. But I know I don't wanna die I just want a solution to my problems."

"Strangulation. Possibly addicted?I engage in self strangulation, usually by either wrapping cords, fabric or my own hands around my throat and keeping it there until I'm on the verge of passing out.

While I am a year clean of self harm in the form of cutting, I've recently turned to this form of taking out my anger and stress.

I haven't been attending much as of recently, my heads imploded, I'm isolated here and I've become a disgusting degenerate. Drinking and drinking and smoking and staying in bed because I'm too terrified to face the reality that is the outside world. 

I nearly killed myself in January because I was on the brink of failing, however, I managed to get the exams delayed due to genuine reasons. Car crash and eviction. This time, what excuse do I have? It's my own fault. I have to pass everything to pass. So I've failed this. I will have to set my plan in action.

My whole meaning in life is my future career, my dream. If I fail this I will be resigned to my shitty hometown working in a dead end job miserable, a burden to my family and probably end up killing myself anyway. At least this way it'll be done far away from everyone. 

This and my messy head that never stops being messy and my body and my mind and everything. No. No more. It ends here. I'm 20 years old and I've been insane on and off since 14, it's just getting worse as I get older, the pills don't seem to be helping. But they'll help me today. I plan to gather all medication I have in my room, painkillers and my sleeping pills, add that in with a large amount of vodka and put a plastic bag over my head just as I start passing out.

"My rant about women in general And by women, I mean raisins

And by general, I mean in cookies 

Why the hell do raisin cookies exist? Most the time you think theyâre a delicious chocolate chip cookie, and then BAM. Itâs a nasty ass raisin that tastes awful. 

The only person I could think that would eat a raisin cookie is a homeless person whoâs starving for food. Raisins do NOT belong in cookies. And the cookies themselves usually taste awful when it has raisins in them, like the dough is hard or too chewy.

This has been my rant about raisins in cookies, this has nothing to do with women I just wanted to clickbait you."

"No! Punishing a person equally who falsely accused another of rape is not a good idea. Hear me out first  

This will probably get buried in New but I wanted to say this because I've been seeing these posts frequently about how accuser should be punished the same or even worse than a person who has committed a crime if it is a false accusation. Punishing them as equally bad misses the point. Rape is a crime that is notoriously difficult to prove. And if someone is not proven guilty then they are pronounced to be innocent(innocent until proven guilty). Regard this case : A man rapes a woman in her sleep, she wakes up to find out that she is being raped. She can't speak because she is in shock(which is wayy fequent than I'd like for it to be). If she goes to the police, she doesn't have any evidence to prove it, so the rapist is free. Would it be justified to punish her?

Not only that but the victims of abuse and assault, whether they be man or woman, always feels like they are at fault whereas the perpetrator usually believe that they are right in doing so.

What I think should be done instead is that they should apologise and then the media should clarify that the accused was innocent. It's not a full proof plan so I would like to have a civil and logical discussion about it. And please don't bring your feelings into this. I'd love to have better ideas about this problem here."

"Bf wants to die, so do i.Weâre both depressed as shit. Previous suicide attempts. I could honestly go on with him by my side if he was okay. He canât work a job or go out or eat barely. Heâs stopped self harming because he canât even feel pain anymore. I still have my emotions and I can cry and whatnot but I canât go on without him. He has saved my life before, he gives me a will to live. 

I know itâs toxic. I donât have friends and Iâve given up so donât tell me to keep looking, thereâs no shared values or connections. I always hear âafter a breakup it feels impossible but you will move on.â And iâve been through that with my ex. I tried killing myself multiple times and though e dated for 7 months it took me a year to get over him, and fuck was it painful it destroyed me. I know I canât go through that same pain of losing someone again, and plus this time it would be 10000x worse. He means the world to me. If a dog is suffering so much youâd put him out of his misery, my quality of life wonât be livable. Iâm considering a double suicide or some shit right now. I feel so guilty watching him in agony and itâs tearing us both down. The worst part is weâre still so in love but thatâs not enough to keep holding on. My choice is breakup with him and I know heâd kill himself. Or if I stay with him until he eventually does, thereâs not way Iâd be able to go on. Sure itâs co-dependant but when life is awful heâs the only good thing. I canât stop crying and panicking and i canât fucking breathe. 

All I can picture is us lying down in a bed and dying together. I promise Iâm not romanticizing it, it scares the shit out of me that this thought is the only thing soothing me.

"In a pointless downward spiral - no clue how to crawl out.I'll try to keep this as brief as possible - despite having wonderful friends, an even more wonderful girlfriend, and a complete inability to panic, I am stuck in a default state of horrendous depression and only escape it by distracting myself with things like video games, drinking, or sex. I was in college for a year, dropped out to take an amazing job halfway across the country, and then was justifiably let go after only three months due to being generally incompetent at my unbelievably simple retail-oriented. It took me nearly half a year to find another job, only to be let go once more after just one month for what I can only assume was general incompetence (""you're just not the right fit for our company"" was the most detail they gave, and I felt I was doing a great job until then). I was hired at a place that gives very sporadic work not long after, and am only making enough money to pay for food/bus fare while my increasingly fed-up father has been paying my rent and bills. I keep searching for work, albeit without much heart, because my problem is that things just feel utterly hopeless on a cold, impossible-to-ignore logical level. I feel stupid and incapable of pulling off even the most basic of adult functions, which leads to depression, which leads to me moping around and not doing anything, which leads to proving the point (and angry room mates screaming about the messes I don't clean up), and on and on and on and on. Suicide, in my convoluted logic, isn't so much a one-way ticket to a pain-free state of being as it is a logical step to remove myself as a burden to everyone around me. The only thing keeping me from going through with it is the very laziness and lack of motivation that brings about the feeling in the first place - I'd have to push myself pretty hard to buy something to do the deed with, or crawl up an abandoned building somewhere.

TL;DR no matter how much work I do to try and free myself, I am completely stuck in life, so i'm left with no motivation to keep on trying."
"Iâm an intelligent person and I know how to escape my situation but I canât escape myself or the choices I make. I am my own worst enemy and thatâs why I pray for a brutal death to get back at myself.Sup guys. Iâm here right now because I just need to vent and commiserate.

Iâm 23M. Indian-American. Reasonably good looking, professionally successful, financially in good/bad shape (more on that later), socially in good/bad shape (ditto), have great family support, and in general am fairly privileged.

I despise myself though, and Iâm trapped in a bubble of horrible choices I repeatedly make for myself. I feel like Iâm being held hostage by myself and I donât know what to do anymore besides wish for death - and at that, a particularly brutal and violent one because I want to inflict as much damage on this âotherâ me that keeps me in a constant state of torment.

Mental illness-wise, I have bipolar disorder type 2 which I refuse to keep in check. 

Ok. Letâs begin.

My family is fantastic and supportive. As a member of a âmodel minorityâ with high standards, I destroyed school. I went to a T-10 Public School on a full scholarship on top of which I earned $70k in National Merit money. I got a solid degree, and am working at a highly prestigious innovation think tank for the largest payer in the nation (healthcare). I intend to pursue medical school after this and have been assured I will be a shoe-in at top programs. I live in a cool city. Iâm in shape, Iâm supposedly good-looking and attract a fair bit of attention. I have cool hobbies that people are often in awe of. I have great friends who add value to my life. Iâm intellectually curious and can hold a conversation with anyone about anything. I have good EQ and can navigate social situations well.

But I couldnât be more dissatisfied and frustrated with myself. My executive skills are absolute shite - I do everything by the seat of my pants and without planning or forethought which places me in bad situations. Most recently I missed a flight (I routinely miss flights) for a fun trip and missed half the trip on top of which I paid a rebooking fee. Iâm constantly falling behind at work, which is a fast-paced environment. Similarly, I earned a position with a high-impact research journal and was awaiting info from them but then just let it slide. Even though they forgot to reach out to me, I doubt theyâll want me back since I too didnât reach back out to them. Iâve previously been fired from a research lab because I was playing fast and loose (showing up late, leaving early, showing up in shorts, showing up high off my ass - being high or in shorts wasnât addressed but Iâm confiding that in you). Iâm burning through money like anything. I miss breakfast in the morning so I eat at Dunkin Donuts followed by lunch at Chipotle followed by a 2-3 course meal from a restaurant at dinner. On average Iâm spending $600-$800/month on food alone. Funnily enough: I swing back and forth between blowing money on food to not eating for an entire day or two straight (Iâve always had problems with eating - I find it infuriating that eating is necessary, takes time, and costs money. At the peak of my depression I lost 37lbs in 3 months). This means I canât keep an exercise routine going because I donât have energy (I love exercising but I donât have the discipline to maintain a routine longer than a week - in 5 years of weightlifting Iâve made little to no progress). I donât take my medication (lamictal and abilify) because in my head when I miss them Iâm like, well whatâs the fucking point now? So I keep missing it. Iâve been off for weeks now, before which I probably took it for a week or two, before which I missed it for a month straight. I barely go to my psychiatrist and therapy appointments even though I find them deeply beneficial because Iâm lazy, uncommitted, and because itâs hard with my work schedule. Oh, I havenât paid any of the medical bills Iâve gotten in the mail either. I get a speed trap ticket or red light ticket at least once a week, which contributes to burning through cash (my insurance rates have exploded because of two car accidents Iâve been in along with a slew of speeding tickets in which Iâve been pulled over). Iâve been masturbating for 9 years straight, at least once a day. This keeps my libido at nonexistent levels coupled with damage from SSRIâs that I took earlier. This makes me feel bad because I donât reciprocate the interest I receive and fuels the intimacy issues I already have from my first girlfriend cheating on me, from the repeated borderline sexual assault I suffered from a FWB, and long-standing insecurities about how as a minority guy Iâm hideous and have a small penis. I donât talk to my grandparents enough. The other day, without thinking at all, I burned $500 at a strip club when my account is already in dire straits (so - my parents are managing the 70k for me by investing it. I run my affairs on my salary, so at the moment my credit card bill is higher than whatâs in my checking account). My roommate left a few weeks ago, and while I shouldâve IMMEDIATELY or even proactively sought out someone to replace him, Iâve been sitting on my ass so Iâll just keep eating the entire rent check. Iâve made 0 friends in the new city Iâm in, where Iâve been since March. Part of that is that I got complacent with my roommate, who negatively impacted my psyche because he was a slob (Iâm a clean freak) who stayed at home. He got me into smoking cigarettes which I continue to smoke to this day (I started smoking around April/May - if I get lung cancer Iâm not getting treatment for it, Iâm committing suicide) despite HATING every aspect of it. They make me choke, they smell, and I hate myself right after. Thankfully I havenât smoked weed in about two weeks, but I have an addiction to marijuana. In college, from sophomore year to senior year I more or less smoked weed all day every day. At one point I bought $10,000 worth of weed with the intention to sell it through a network of dealers. Despite having strong social intuition and being able to flip a switch to become extroverted and hypersocial, Iâm deeply socially anxious. I lie a lot. On rare occasions I steal from stores (a single pen, and at most a $100 rug from Walmart). I usually barely sleep. Iâll make the choice to have back-to-back marathon masturbation sessions, or watch Netflix/Prime until 4-5AM and then pass out and get to work where Iâm hazy and drowsy the rest of the day.

I feel absolutely powerless. My life is objectively so good and so easy. But Iâm self-destructing and self-sabotaging at every step, so Iâm always in fear of how Iâm going to kick myself another rung down the ladder with a bad choice. This feeling of powerlessness is a function of *myself* because **Iâm** the one making decisions that Iâll suffer the consequences of.

This leads me to the last point of my title: Iâm constantly fantasizing about hanging myself from a power line, or slicing my forearms open or eating a shotgun blast or jumping into traffic. I want to go out with a bang in an immense way so that itâs a painful and magnificent death just as a fuck you to myself. I donât know why I care, but itâd be cool for my friends and family to see how much I hated myself. Maybe Iâm a fucking pussy for caring about that and not truly even worthy of making a post here since Iâm âfakeâ suicidal and want to make a spectacle of it.

Does anyone have any advice?

**TL;DR: Iâm a tyrant to myself and hold my life hostage through a never-ending stream of bad choices. I have no self-control, even though I know what *should* be done, so I canât actually correct my life. Perpetually in a state of hopelessness as I watch myself make bad decision after bad decision and basically self-destruct. As my moods change I become more or less resilient. Currently am suicidal.**"
"I donât really feel like life is worth livingFor some people it is. Some people have great lives Iâm sure. Some people have amazing friends or they found their soul mate. I have nothing and no one. I have my daughter who would be better off without me. I have a husband who just picked a fight with me before he left for work because I was feeling depressed and he apparently âjust wants me to be happyâ and he thinks getting mad at me for being sad is the right way to make me happy. Heâs not my soul mate but Iâm stuck because my family wonât take me back at this point. We just got married last year and I have a baby. I donât have a job Iâm waiting on state approval for child care assistance.

So I left everything that I know behind to move in with my husband. I moved 800 miles away from my family. At the time I didnât even want to be with him I was just so desperate to get out of my familyâs home because I was so unimportant to them. I was so lonely and depressed. Even now I have no one not a single soul I can call to talk. My parents would never understand my sister and I donât talk about these things none of my âfriendsâ answer the phone when I call and never call me back when I ask.

I have no one Iâve always been alone. No one even wants to be my friend god knows I donât have a fucking soul mate. I want to kill myself because my baby will be better off. I donât want to be in this relationship anymore but I canât leave. I donât have anyone or anything to offer the world. Even if I could leave my marriage I would never find anyone else to love me the way I want to be loved. I canât even find a friend that truly loves me. I just want to end it all and get it over with. I tried to kill myself at 15 but I failed and I didnât try again because I hoped things would get better. I wish I could go back and tell myself that it never gets any fucking better"
"I'm a failure, I had to drop out of highschool due to medical issues and I lost all my friends. Idk I don't really see any point of living, I thought I'd get some enjoyment out of buying a playstation 5 but nah nothing really makes me happy anymore.

But anyways thanks for reading sorry for wasting your time."
"A week doesn't go by without me being so suicidal, that it makes my partner suicidal as well. And sometimes, my brain will convince me that the solution to it all is to just die.Today, like pretty much every single week for the past month, I would get into such a terrible mood that it would negatively affect my partner as well. It's so fucking stupid and annoying of me. I love him to death (inappropriate to say this now but oh well lol) but sometimes it feels like I'm a burden to him. So my brain is sitting here all ""KILL YOURSELF NOW OR ELSE I WILL!"" type bullshit, and I tell him quite frankly when I don't feel so good, which makes him sad and suicidal, which then makes me even more sad and suicidal, and then we both cry, act like we're about to do it, calm down, get over it. But that cycle really sucks. The guilt is also so ... intense.

But today, I was so sure that he was going to kill himself that my brain started immediately focusing on what I'd do to myself. That feeling of acceptance is scary and I do not want it ever again. I do not want to be okay with the idea of him killing himself, and then me doing the same. 

What sucks though is that our relationship is long distance, but we will meet soon. I wish I were with him. I think I would feel better if he were there in real life, and I would do just about anything to make him happy. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Traditional help (psychiatrist, medication, therapy) does not work. I've tried for years. What else could work? I don't believe in traditional medicine or homeopathy but I am desperate. "
"So uh...I'm a bit confused and i need answers. After all those ""Skinny boys are cute"" posts came from an 8 y/o account flaired as 13 (totally not sus or smth), are skinny boys still cute or nah?

Ps.: I know that shit was 2 months ago."
"Just tired of everything.I am just tired of it all, I have lost so much in my life, I have no family left, they have passed away, or in jail. Going through a divorce, and yet she is still the love of my life. It is just hell living with someone with PTSD as bad as mine is. I am tired of the nightmares, quilt, anger, sadness and everything else. I tired of remembering friends and then remembering the last moments. I cant live with the memories of watching someone slowly dim to nothing. I am tired of blaming myself for them not making it back, I was the medic, I was supposed to bring everyone home. I am tired of not waking up next to my wife. I cant keep seeing the fear in her eyes as I came out of a flashback, or the fear in her eyes as she is calling 911 after I took a bottle of pills, or as I was standing in front of the tub with a hot electrical cord in hands. I have lost everything, everyone I loved. I lost the kind good-natured person I was, I lost my humanity and for what. I just don't know if can pick myself up again if i can go on. I think about just walking away so many time through out the day I am just afraid I am going to do it one of these times."
"i dont get it, apparently im cute according to lots of girls but i have no clue what being cute is! im on a discord server and sometimes i change my profile pic to a pic of me (on my profile somewhere) and the girls keep calling me cute

"There's only one reason I haven't killed myself yet, and it's not a very good one. (CW: rape)When I was 17, I was raped.  He was my boyfriend at the time.  He'd done something, asked if it was ok if he slept with someone else on his upcoming 18th birthday, or something like that, and it had disgusted me.  I didn't want to have sex with him that night, but ""no"" was not an answer he liked to hear.  Previously, when I'd said ""no"", he just got me drunk, but that night he just kept pushing and pushing until I gave in, because I felt like I had to.

I had a history of being abused before that.  My family was not a good one.  He knew this.  He had also systematically isolated me from all of my friends.  He knew there was nobody else in my life, and he knew that gave him power.
I cried the whole way through, and even though he didn't ""finish"", because ""it really started feeling like I was raping you, and I'm not a rapist"", that didn't erase the previous... fifteen or so minutes, if I remember correctly.  He didn't stop for me.  He stopped for his own self-image.

To this day, he is the only person I have had sex with, willingly or otherwise, and that's the only reason I haven't killed myself yet.  I don't want to die knowing he was the only person ever to have fucked me, it feels like he's winning.  Especially since it's been over half a decade since it happened, and I've still not been able to be with someone else.

I feel like that's slowly becoming less and less of a concern though.  Nobody would want me now anyway.  I have no life in me, there's nothing about me that would attract another person.  I recently realised, after spending several months without any of my friends contacting me, that I could literally have already been rotting and nobody would have noticed.

I don't know why I've not done it.  Maybe I'm scared of the pain of failure."
"How to create a life thatâs bearable???Weâve all head the common trope âpeople want to commit suicide because they want to end their PAIN, not their LIVESâ. 

Okay well yeah maybe.... but thereâs no good way to live for someone like me. Holding a job feels impossible because my âbad daysâ are unpredictable and I canât be calling off work every time I have panic or Iâm too depressed to move. 

Iâve been suicidally depressed for 10 years. Meds donât help, therapy doesnât help, hospitals donât help. This is who I am. IF I could create a simple and comfortable life by living off disability, I would DO IT. But the sad truth is that disability isnât enough to live off of. Iâd lose my car, my credit would go to shit, Iâd never be independent again. 

The sad truth is that money is freedom in our society. Iâm not well enough to make money. So it feels sort of like natural selection. I canât burden others with taking care of me. 

Suicidal is quite literally the only option. I genuinely REGRET not going through with it when I had morphine available. The only thing the past few years have brought me is more pain and suffering.

Iâm smart enough to know that the older I get, the worse it will get. I just canât wait for a good opportunity to end it all. I wasnât cut out for this world and Iâve accepted it. Itâs sad that if it were possible, Iâd give life a chance. But itâs not possible. Not for someone like me. 

Recovery wonât ever happen, and misery is certain should I embrace poverty. I guess this is just me realizing there really isnât a better way."

"My ass hurts so bad My ass has been hurting all day, at like 11:20 AM when I left zoom for my lunch break, I realized my ass hurt from sitting down probably, then I was like âmy ass hurts lolâ in my discord class chat expecting it was just gonna be something that would come and go, so I went to class it didnt hurt as bad while sitting down on my chair, after all my zoom classes ended, I went to my bed to play fall guys as I normally do after school, but it still hurts, now itâs 7:50 PM for me, not sure why it still hurts or what caused it"
"iâm sick of everything at this point and wish i could just die in any wayi just want everything to stop and i wish i could get into some kind of accident that could kill me so i wonât have to go through this. it doesnât help that i always hurt people too. i donât mean it, it just happens. iâve tried suicide hotlines multiple times and they donât help. iâm 18 and unemployed and my parents wonât let me get a job until covid vaccines come out and i feel so behind because all of my other friends either have a job, are in college, or both. iâve been dealing with suicidal thoughts off and on in my life since late middle school and now iâm out of school and still going through hell. the last time i tried to i was going to sneak out my window and harm myself but i couldnât get my screen open so i just ended up crying myself to sleep. iâm not out as trans to my parents yet and iâm not sure when iâll be able to and that really digs at me too. itâs getting to the point where iâm making more and more plans on what to do and how to do it. i purposely stay up late since thatâs when i have time to be alone and sleep late so i have less of the day to go through. iâve thought about doing drugs so i can have something numb the pain. i just want everything to end for me."
Fuck you I won't do what you tell meFuck you depression you bitch. Fuck losing control. Fuck losing the plot. You will not control me. Though I feel absolutely sick with it.

"I've never been this close before.I... I'm new to this. I've had suicidal thoughts when I was younger but this is the only time I've ever really been driven to almost doing it. My mother is the absolute WORST with politics, so anytime someone tries to have a conversation with her she blows up on them and then drags my dad into it. 

My brother tried to ask her something about Bernie or some shit and she went on an unrelated rant about corona virus and then I tried to mediate like a dumbass and I was screamed at as well.

She and Dad and my brother got into a pissing match and I escaped to the basement to cry it out. But then she came down and told me how worthless and selfish and high and mighty I am and brought up my inability to find work and my own place. It just.... This whole thing is the last straw. This isn't even the first time she made us all bolt because she was in some fucking fit.

I have my athame, I have all of my brothers weapons. I'm so fucking close to doing it just so I don't have to be here anymore. I've wanted to die since I was 12 and now at 20 I may actually go through with it."
"Bored to death, life is over-rated, suicidalJust spent 4 agonizing and boring hours and I kept thinking how life was over-rated, how life sucks and is boring most of the time, and how the negative aspects of life outweighed the positives. I was very miserable the whole time I was at work, and if I had an ""Easy Button"" - a button that I could press which would kill me instantly and painlessly, I would have pressed it with no hesitation. It's not like I had nothing to do with work: I was actually working too slowly and the work was piling up.

Came home and saw my dog just sitting there on the couch, not moving at all, business as usual. I love my dog more than anything in the world. Seeing this just made me more depressed and reinforced my belief in life being over-rated.

I'm not so bored now (browsing the web), but I would still hit that Easy Button if I could. I'd say right now I'm slightly bored, I could play some video games to entertain me, but I've got other shit to take care of.

The only real obstacle to me committing suicide right now is that I don't have the means to. I have some kitchen knives that I can use to slit my carotid artery but I'm too afraid of pain. I heard having your heart stop beating is a nice way to die, you just lose consciousness and eventually you're gone. Sounds nice to me."
"I'm so disappointed by myself I don't want to live anymoreFor many years I have been contemplating the meaning of life. I have always been the kind of undecisive person never taking a real path and always changing my mind about things. I changed my major at university so many times and never actually graduate. So I took a job and got married at 22. Then moved to Thailand, my wife's country and found a job where I worked for 8 years and we had 2 kids. Unfortunately my confused personality reemerged again after my 31st birthday and I started sort of mid life crisis that pushed me to leave my job, I felt unhappy and wanted more but without any qualifications I was already lucky to have that job. I had panic attacks when I gave my resignation letter to the boss so that he realized I wasn't really 100% sane so now he doesn't want me back. 

After that I stopped sleeping, had furious panic attacks with me screaming in front of my kids and wife. Eventually I went back home and got in a psychiatric ward for a month where they gave my heavy sedatives and anti depressants. I attempted sucide with pills once. After a few months I felt better and went back to Thailand and for 1 year I have been able even to work for a new place and earn money.

Problem is now I feel deeply unhappy and insecure about my life, underappreciated by everyone. My wife simply doesn't understand me and tries to find obstacles instead of helping me. I feel depression coming back and I wish to end my life. Only my kids keep me here, I want to help them to survive this heelish world but with this conflict inside of me I don't know how to find peace."
"As a person who English speaks: I hate when people grammar use incorrectly? That ticks me really off. Like, English you should learn and know!!!"
This has been a difficult time for everyone lately and the topic of mental health and depression seems to resurface again and again. I wrote this short blog-post about how I feel since a very disturbing event happened to me a few days ago.

"One minute Iâm stable. The next minute Iâm debating hanging myself.I have BPD. Itâs utterly exhausting how fast my mood can shift. It used to be that my moods would shift over the course of a couple days. Now it can bounce back and forth between extremes several dozen times in a single day.

Yesterday morning (12/3) I woke up in an extremely bad place. Iâve been displaying escalating parasuicidal behavior for several weeks. Weâre talking using a pellet gun that looks very much like a Glock as a prop to try to get people to acknowledge and validate how shitty and horrible I feel. Also, to get them to help me dig out from the hole Iâve dug for myself, because I have no clue how to climb out on my own.

Iâve also been extremely manic, but itâs not random mania. Itâs a manic urge to hide from my emotional turmoil and pain. Weâre talking things like getting in my car and driving 1,400 hundred miles, blowing literally all of my savings and maxing out my credit cards on a fancy hotel and ridiculous dinners for two weeks, and also just cruising around in my car to the tune of an additional 5,000 miles because why the hell not.

The manic energy scares me. Especially when combined with the rapidly cycling moods and my massive impulse control issues. Itâs a recipe for disaster.

I spent my day having heart to heart talks with my mom and my best friend on the phone. I spent over 6 hours talking on the phone total between the two of them. And I felt better while talking to them. But within 30 minutes of each call ending, I started having feelings of despair and hopelessness consume me again. And itâs not just the feelings that are the issue. Itâs the urges and impulses. When I feel a particularly strong wave of emotion hits me, my first thought is about hanging myself or stepping out in front of a bus. Iâve felt these urges wash over me several times today. I came very close to giving into the temptation of stepping in front of the bus, I literally started sweating in 30 degree weather because I was so close to doing it. I walked around for a few hours afterwards in a daze/dissociated state while silently crying.

I moved to a new hotel room and I spent at least 30 minutes examining the room to find the best place to anchor my belt or the bathrobeâs belt. I do this basically anywhere I post up for a night. Honestly Iâm always scanning my surroundings to see what my best path out of living is in that moment, just in case I decide to indulge the urge. Itâs like Iâm always planning.

Now as I lay in bed, Iâll feel okay for a few minutes. Then a thought that triggers a strong emotion will run through my head, and the next thing you know Iâm literally mentally picturing myself taking necessary steps to hang myself. Then 5 minutes later, Iâm back to being calm and collected. 10 minutes after that, another triggering thought pops into my head and I go back to fantasizing about ending it all.

The rapid oscillation between being okay one minute and then being ready to wrap a belt around a closet hanger bar the next minute, is very exhausting. Itâs very unpleasant. Itâs just an unwanted roller coaster ride. Worst of all, these kinds of rapid and massive emotional state changes and urges are increasingly common in my life... To a level that is frankly mentally crippling.

I donât want to die. But I feel like, out of my very limited and very shitty options, dying is the most favorable outcome. Itâs still a shitty choice, but none of my other options (staying alive and letting go of the past that I dearly miss) are desirable given my emotional issues.

This all just sucks so much, and Iâm so beyond down and exhausted from it all. I just want some stability."

"Would people envy a 30yo outcast shy loner with $250K net worth or pity him?I'm 32 with a $250K net worth which according to online calculators would place me around the 95th percentile for NW in my age range. While that may be impressive for a man if everything else in his was normal, that's not the case for me

Other than that high NW and the fact that I've traveled to nearly 10 countries, I don't have much going for myself. I've been bullied and ostracized many times in school and in the workplace. I have many gaps in my resume due to being fired or quitting early jobs due to being bullied. 

Also, while that NW and my $100K job may seem like a lot, for people who also work as software engineers at my age, alot of them are making at least double that since they likely don't have any gaps in their resume and weren't bullied out of jobs

Also, I still struggle with shyness, depression, social anxiety, and literally have no friends. I just have acquaintances I've met from meetup groups. I've never even had a girlfriend. More girls have shown my pity than they've shown romantic interest

I believe I have pretty severe PTSD from all the past bullying. I've seen numerous therapists and none of them have really helped.

Alot of times I struggle with even having motivation to live. I've literally met only a few people who have been as shy, friendless, softspoken or depressed as me

I'd like honest feedback as to whether people would actually be envious of me or whether they would pity me and look down on me, similar to how society pities/looks down on the homeless, men who have minimum paying jobs, etc"
"I think the best way to go would just be to OD on heroineIts bloodless, painless and I be happy. Ive never done heroine but ive been addicted to weed because it helped me cope. kinda fucked up that people demonize drugs and people and pay no attention to what drives them to it or give them a better way to cope or help themselves. people are so fucking stupid and hypocritical. Im done with their rules. Im done looking for help. When i read a post about someone saying goodbye, i dont feel sad, i feel happy for them. I wish them good luck. I hope they have the courage to go through with it. the only thing i look forward to is sleep because at least i have pleasant dreams. This evening i dreamt i was laying in the arms of someone i was attracted to not too long ago. In real life she rejected me. She would be crazy if she didnt. In my dream she still wasnt that into me but she let me lean back on her between her legs and i stroked her legs because they felt really smooth. I kinda knew it was a dream but i still gave myself permission to enjoy the moment. Then i wake up and realize what a stark difference reality is from the world in my head. The truth is id rather be totally lost in my head and never come out. I have nothing to look forward to in reality. Im 32 and im drowning in debt, i have no friends, i live with my parents, the last jobs i had were so depressing that i quit a year ago and havent worked since. When i go outside i feel pressure to enjoy being around people but i really hate it. I feel ashamed of my life. I just try to avoid eye contact and give away as little of myself as possible. Im not going to try anymore because ive literally been trying my whole life and nothing has worked out right. I dont want to ""get help"" because im pretty sure not even you know what that means, or what its like to look for help and become disappointed when noone is willing or able to give you the help you need. I dont want to fucking talk to anyone. I want my life fixed and no one can fix it but me and i dont even know how to fix it. Im jealous of people who  go through with suicide. It sounds pretty awesome. Its scary to you but its almost like one of the few if not only things i have control of. Fuck you for trying to make me feel ashamed for not being willing to put up with this bullshit state of consciousness anymore. I hope i at least have a nice dream before i go."
"Why live""don't drink alcohol because it'll fuck up your brain"" but what if my brain is already fucked up sober?

I'm a 27 male, cancer survivor (brain tumor at age 8) and idk how I'm still alive. I've got like 30% of vision left, most of it in my left eye,y right eye has gone lazy from lack of use apparently. Also deaf from both ears die to the chemotherapy. On top of that I have a speech problem. Did I forget to mention that I have a golf ball size hole in my head where my pituitary gland was?

So, with all that, idk how I'm still alive and how I haven't suicided yet. From an outsider view, guess I'm doing well, got an 80k career job with lots of benefits and a master's degree but 30hr drive from my family. But I don't have a girlfriend or best friend for even a friend here, just a roommate and a bunch of co-workers/people from work. I don't have anyone to truly talk to, no one that shares my same interests and never have ever since I was born. Always felt like an outsider. Only been invited to 2 birthday parties and that was pre-cancer. My older brother who had more potential died from a hit-and-run on his motorcycle. My mom who used to say ""why can't you be more like your brother?"" now says ""why can't you be a normal person?"". (jokingly?) 
I currently live 2,000 miles from home, can't drive, can barely hear (can never hold a conversation let alone a group one cuz I can't hear shit.) I feel alone and trapped. Can't drive, too blind, can never be an independent man. Always at the mercy of others. What is life and is there a god/heaven?
I just want to die, reincarnate into a world like ""By the grace of Gods"" anime where I'm loved and appreciated, and also don't have this shitty body of mine.
Depression? It'll never go away. Mine is not based on money or other society struggles, but things I can never fix, like my vision, hearing, speaking.
I just want to stop suffering, and stop being alone."
What does hanging feel like?Has anyone tried it or experienced something similar? It's one of my only options right now.
Iâm tired of this worldI find meaning then i lose it. I find something to enjoy then it goes away. I say ok now Iâm comfortable with myself and find âMeâ then something destroys it. I try to communicate it then it gets muddy again. What is it with this world? Iâve been experiencing this since i was 18 now Iâm 27 and still feel it. I find love after so fucking years and lose it in a heartbeat. Every since I understood that circle I decided Iâm too tired to live like this but i was afraid to hurt my family and my mum. I donât anymore. Iâm afraid. Not doing it and coming here and talking to strangers kinda helps. Does this circles break at some point or does it keep going? Iâm really tired.

"I am so fat and greedy For the last THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS I have went on THREE CALORIE SURPLUSES. Iâve ate 2000 calories. You might think that 2000 calories is âtheâ standard amount but for me it will cause weight gain. Judging from how fat my family is and how much puppy fat I got during puberty, I have a slow metabolism and it is very easy for me to gain weight. I have to stick to 1,600 calories a day, even with plenty of exercise. I made a huge mistake today. I was confident and thinking that I ate 1,650, but when I added the calories in all of the five apples I snacked on THATS TWO THOUSAND THATS TOO MUCH I AM SO FUCKINGG FAT BEING SKINNY IS PART OF WHO I AM.
Itâs not just my obsession witb being skinny. If itâs not weight, itâs some other insecurity and source of low self-esteem. If I was fat I could write a long long list of why I love myself but still hate myself to shreds because I would be fat. Being skinny is the foundation of all my identity and self-esteem."
"Is there a way I can tell my therapist that I'm suicidal WITHOUT getting sent to a hospital/mental asylum?I have been seeing a therapist for a week now, and I want to tell her I've been experiencing suicidal thoughts recently (I've been close to actually doing it numerous times; I sat on the edge of a 7-story building last week), but I also don't *want* to be hospitalized.

"Doctors stole my life with a botched iv. Now my body is a horror show and all I want, everyday, is to die a quick painless death.Had an MRI with contrast in 17. Radiologists conveniently forgot to tell me how toxic the iv was and some healthy patients (with normal kidneys) retain the toxin.

Oh and thereâs no way to get it out. And thereâs no research on the damage it can do.

A day later I lost feeling in much of my toes and fingers, blurred vision, insane fatigue, brain fog, joint pain throughout, vibrations all over that kept me up.

âOh geez,â the radiologists told me. âThatâs so weird! I dunno what to tell you; maybe see your primary care doc!â.

Gee thanks.

Here we are 3 years later and Iâm no better, and all I do each day is search suicide websites for the quickest easiest most painless way to kill myself.

Thanks modern medicine! You sentenced me to a slow painful death for the crime of having a lumbar mri."
"Having trouble helping suicidal siblingI recently discovered my younger sibling is suicidal. You would have never known. I spoke to him once about it, but didn't mention he was suicidal, just said I cared for their mental health. But I don't know how to get myself to speak about it again and it is bothering me 24-7. People who are suicidal, does somebody reaching out help a lot? how should I go about it without making them feel forced to share anything, or without making them feel like their ""cover"" is blown? I'm sick to my stomach over how hard it is for me to simply check up on someone I love but I feel like I am bothering them and will make things worse? Can that be true? Thank you for any advice."
"I'm not sure what this post is about butI'm a teen, and lord am I having a hard time with finding a will to live. I don't have really any close friends, maybe a couple, but I'm not their first choice. It sucks being the last choice in your friend group, which is why I don't talk to anyone outside of school anymore. I don't have any motivation to do anything academic wise. it's not that I'm dumb, I'm kinda smart, just nothing interests me and everything's done last minute. I'm ugly as hell, and I hate the fact that people have to look at me. I don't know what I have to live for, and I feel selfish for saying that. I don't have any mental or physical illness, and nothing traumatic has happened to me. I just don't want to live. I'm not gonna do anything anytime soon, at least I think, because I don't want to be that one girl who killed herself in school. I don't want any bullshit memorials or any pictures of me hung up. My parents are proud of me for the first time in my life, because I'm quiet and lock myself in my room. I don't want to end it while I'm still living with them. Also a new season of one my favorite shows is coming out this year, and as stupid as it sounds, I have that to hold on to. I'm trying to get better but once once I graduate, I'm not sure how long I'm gonna last. I don't even know if I'm exaggerating everything or what I'm really feeling, which is why I'm not talking to anyone, besides this post i guess. As I said, I don't really know why I'm posting this, I'm think just frustrated and needed to vent somewhere. Anyways, to whoever might be reading this, thank you."
"My girlfriend of 3 years left me, please helpI'm sorry if this seems disjointed, or even overly calm, I don't know how I should be feeling at the moment, the only thing I know is that if I threw myself in front of a train this pain would stop for good.

She left me about a fortnight ago, and i've taken it fairly well up until now. She kept saying she still wants to be my friend, and that she still cares about me, that I still have a place in her heart, but actions speak louder than words and she ignores me when I need to talk to her the most, holds the smallest of things against me, and is generally making me feel worthless/like she wants me dead.

what makes it worse is that I've always tried to give her the best of everything, and being with her was the only thing I looked forward to at the end of the day. I no longer speak to my family for personal reasons and have no friends where I currently live, and i'm not able to move anywhere else due to a lack of funds. I literally tried to give her the world, before I lost my job I was saving up and was going to surprise her for her birthday in 2 years, letting her choose where on earth she wanted to go, and for how long.

Now I just feel like I'm falling with nothing to grab on to, I can't take pleasure from even the smallest of things like playing a video game over the net with a few guys I know (once again, met over the net) because my thoughts always go back to her and her beautiful smile.

I can't see any reason to go on when the only reason I truly care about doesn't care about me anymore, please, just give me something to look forward to, something to change my mind before I do something stupid, because it seems like it's the only way I won't feel like I've been poisoned from the inside at the moment.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your support, it's still going to be hard but from what you've all said taking some time for myself is definitely the best idea at the moment. In answer to one of the questions, I do contact juggling (I believe you call them Fugashi balls in America) and I'm learning a few card tricks, so I have something to keep myself occupied.

again, thank you all."

""then why's your face red, man? you wasted.""

well, since age 12 i felt like i'm someone else

cuz i hung my original self from the top of the bunk bed with a belt

got pissed off and ripped pamela lee's tits off 

and smacked her so hard i knocked her clothes backward like kris kross

i ate a fat pound of ass, and fell on the grass 

faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast

my engrish teacher wanted to have sex in junior high

the only problem was, my engrish teacher was a guy

slapped him across the face with a brick

stabbed him with a stick

stapled his nuts to the tip of his dick

walked into a strip club, had my jacket zipped up

flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup

extraterrestrial, killin' pedestrians, rapin' lesbians

while they're screaming ""let's just be friends!""

99% of my life i was lied to

i just found out my mom does more ketamine than i do 

i told her i'd grow up to be a famous troll,

and never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down

never gonna run around and desert you

i found out about a spy at r/CultOfHornie

so i told him ""thanks for all the bullshit you started, normie""

Mr.Tripp don't just stand there, operate!

i'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die

i'll have to be carried to the cemetery and buried alive

am i cumming or going? i can barely decide

i just drank a lot of cum, dare me to drive?

all my life i've been very deprived

i ain't had a woman in years, my balls are too hairy to hide

clothes ripped like the incredible hulk

i shpit when i talk, i'll fucc anything that walks

when i was little i used to get so hungry i would throw fits

how you gonna breastfeed me, mom? you ain't got no tits!

i lay awake and try to succ myself in the bed

it would hurt my spine and cut off circulation to my head

i'm steaming mad, and by the way, when you see my dad

tell him i slit his throat in this vision i had

Don't know how much longer I can take feeling like this.  Nothing seems to be going right in my life.  I feel like I am at my breaking point and if nothing changes by tomorrow around this time I have to build up the courage to go ahead and end this pain.  Sorry to vent on here but I have absolutely noone to talk to no friends or anything.  I've tried calling the hotline but it seems that I get put on hold for long periods then keep getting the same guy who seems to rush me off the phone but I guess if I keep getting him he must volunteer a lot and is overwhelmed.  Meds and therapy haven't worked other than to drain my pockets dry. I have lost all hope and don't want to be in this pain anymore. 
Why should I write a test for which I didnât prepare for? Honestly I didnât prepare for this test and Iâm about to cheat on this. If I Do that. I donât have any kind of profit from doing that. Why should I write a test which I didnât prepare?

"Things fall apartI attempted to commit suicide when I was 15, 5 years ago now. I lived and got diagnosed with depression, put on medication, etc.

I thought I was getting better. I really was. I'm in my last year of college and I'm trying to get into graduate programs. I have a wonderful boyfriend of 2.5 years and everything was going fine. At least until a month ago.

My bf lost his job and we had to move back in with my parents. We quickly searched for a new job for him and luckily he landed one with pretty good pay/benefits. Maybe things weren't so bad. That isn't the case.

We're both miserable. Living with my parents is not healthy mentally nor physically. We can't sleep cause of incessant barking from their spoiled dog, there are moths invading every part of the house that they refuse to do anything about, and the place is just unpleasant to live in. Both of our depressions are getting worse. His new job has been stressing him out to the point where I think our relationship is going to die. Not like he'd be happier if I was there, though.

I don't want to be here anymore. I've been trying so hard over the past month to find a new place to live and get a job and quell my loneliness but there's nothing to show for it. I can't even go to my boyfriend cause he's so tired from working he just wants to come home and do nothing. There's no one for me to talk to. No one would miss me if I die. He keeps telling me that he loves me and that he needs me in his life but it's just so hard to believe when we barely interact with each other anymore. All I know is that he can't focus on me right now and it hurts, even if I think about it rationally.

I've been trying to help him as much as I could. Nothing seems to make me nor him feel better. He says he doesn't feel appreciated but neither of us know what to do to try and change things. I'm tired. I feel like a burden. No one will miss me.

As for my parents, they work all the time. I barely get to see them and I can't really talk to them. I don't want to stress them out with my suicidal ideations either, especially since we all thought I was getting better.

I just want the pain to go away. Everything just tells me removing myself from the equation will make everyone else's life better. I don't know how much longer I can go on like this."
"I donât know how to get better
Hello,

Age: 18

Location: UK

Gender: male

Diagnosed with: Psychotic Depression, Anxiety

Iâm on so much medication and I donât seem to be getting better. I am getting worse. 

My medications are:

- Mirtazapine 30mg once daily at night
- Duloxitine 60mg once daily in the morning
- Quetiapine 300mg once daily at night
- Diazepam 5mg prn for panic attacks

Iâm suicidal, Iâm self harming by cutting myself, Iâm hearing my phone whispering to me again, Iâm paranoid about the police coming to arrest me, Iâm anxious to go outside, Iâm so depressed I just want to lay in bed all day and drug myself into a big sleep.

Iâm stuck between a rock and a hard place, if I tell my psychiatrist I know they will put me in an adult mental health hospital, Iâm terrified of that happening. If I donât tell anyone I will probably end up killing myself and I have mixed feelings about suicide at the moment.

Can anyone give me advice on what I can do?

Thanks for any replies."
"I attempted to hang myself todayI wrapped a scarf around my neck and hung myself in my closet... that was until I woke up on the floor convulsing. I mustâve blacked out and the scarf came undone from the closet. 

I remember waking up without realizing that I was awake. I felt nauseous with a headache and in panic. I was having flashbacks to everything that was causing me to commit suicide. I remember thinking âoh itâs just a movie Iâm so glad thatâs not my lifeâ but then as I continuied to gain consciousness I realized that it was real and that it was MY life. 

I lost it at that point and was yelling/crying âwhy!â, âI was so close!â, ânooooooo!â And getting really angry.
I had no remorse and was mad that I wasnât able to complete my mission

It the evening now and I still have no regrets over what I did. Believe it or not I was at piece with myself during that initial blackout and was probably the happiest Iâd been in a long timeâ

My neck is sore and I have a red ring around my neck. I have a headache and some bruising on my body as I think I might have hit something on my way down.

Iâm gonna try again tmr with a belt and see if that works"
"How does motivation from strangers help so much?Like many other people I haven't confided in anyone I know about my suicidal tendencies, but just browsing through forums and messageboards, hearing people out there say that things will get better and that happiness is a possibility helps me. It confounds me.

It's not just one incident, everytime I feel like I'd prefer going away I try and look out for some groups of strangers somewhere on the internet saying that things can be better than they are, and said strangers almost always help me, even if only a little bit.

Even if they're not actually responding to a message I posted, or know nothing about my particular situation, it still helps. The human psyche is so strange. These aren't reasoned arguments or links to studies that have done research with large samples or anything of the sort, just a simple ""hey, I'm sure you'll get better, good luck"" or something along those lines.

I just felt like typing that out, particularly shit day, I think I'll sit down for a long meditation session now.

Thanks people. Good luck to all of you :)"
"Im the most indecisive teenager to ever live And it pains me to say it but i need help picking out christmas options to send to my mother so she knows what to get me.

"I need a gunMy entire life has been a big fuck up. When I was 6 my parents got divorced and I had to go to my dad's house where he would abuse me physically and mentally. Now I'm 14 and I'm close to falling school and have no people who care about me. People tell me it will get better but every day I get up and it gets even worse. Almost everyday I wish I was an abortion in one of my mom's periods or I die in a car crash. This is going to be my 12 attempt of suicide and I need a gun to make sure I don't survive. I have tried going to therapists but thry just make me see how I should end my life. A lot of the time my ""friends"" will make fun of me for my religion and I really don't blame them. I weight 180 pounds, have a stub for a penis, and hope that once I die my mom and dad will see it as a message as how terrible of parents they are. If anyone owns a gun I really need one thanks."
"The days are stretching me thinThe longer the days wear on my mind will turn to suicide more and more often. My girlfriend can't help. I refuse to swallow pills from the Snakes in white coats. 

The prospect of death hasnt been this attractive in a long time.
And the holidays haven't even arrived yet. 

Suppose saying something about it will subconsciously influence the time i have left, leaving me with some sort of makeshift floation device that i can cling to while i wait for the emotions in the deep black waters of my mind to drag me to my bitter end."
"The last note wrote,I see a future full of hope and then I see a future of needles. 

I choose the needles every fucking time.

I want to go out and be something. I want to be known. I want friends, I want a damn life.

But all that shit takes effort. 
And whatâs the point making effort.

I could start now and change everything. Thatâll take time.

I could get high right now and melt into the couch with the artificial happiness Iâve created.

Iâll take that any day of the week. "
Frustrated? Scream with me! Stressed because of school? Angry because of shit parents? Scream here!

"i donât know how this works but i need helpiâm fourteen years old. i have been severely depressed since i started puberty at about age 9. i was diagnosed with ptsd, severe depression, and anxiety last year because a teacher noticed i was crying nonstop for days in class. after a couple of months, i was put on zoloft which made me
suicidal within the next two weeks. itâs august now and iâm a week and a half away from starting freshman year but i donât know if iâll even make it through the year
let me tell you a bit about myself:
i have never met my father. i donât even know if my mother knows who he is. my mother has been in and out of my life for god knows how long. she was/is an addict and i have not spoken to her in over a year while my grandmother keeps in contact with her. my grandparents have custody of me. i live with them along with my brother, aunt, uncle, and three cousins. i have a dog of my own. my grandmother is extremely abusive and a sick human being. she constantly belittles me and physically abuses me. sheâs a disgusting narcissist. i can never do anything well enough and her eyes and she never acts proud of me or that she cares about me. i have a scar on my stomach from where sheâs thrown her car keys at me while raging. if i were to type what all sheâs done i would be typing for hours.
i was groomed at age 12 by a 17 year old. my grandma find out and victim shames me until this day. she constantly brings it up and calls me a whore, say she doesnât expect anything more of me than for me to do it again. 
i have no friends. in sixth grade, i lost every friend i had. the only people i consider my friends bully me relentlessly, mock my weight, personality, and mental illness. itâs so hard for me to make friends. i feel hopeless whenever i talk to people, i always get blatantly ignored. iâm not âannoying.â iâm a nice person, i really am. i have a similar personality and sense of humor as most other kids my age, i just get very anxious sometimes.
i have been questioning my sexuality and gender identity for years. my grandmother has found this out multiple times and verbally harassed me about my sexual identity. i am bisexual.
i have a boyfriend. heâs my only friend and the only person i get along with. he means a lot to me and i donât want to hurt him in any way, heâs so sweet and cares about me a lot. 
i have been very suicidal lately. iâve self harmed to the point where i draw so much blood i almost pass out. 
i donât know how much i can take anymore. i feel so hopeless and nothing has helped. therapy, pills, âhealthyâ coping mechanisms. i want to kill myself. i know iâm young but i donât see a future. i canât survive the next 4 years in this house, it hurts to bad. i cry every single day. i donât know what to do and i feel so lost. what am i supposed to do now?"
"Iâm losing interest in everything I love.Iâm losing the love that I have for the world, I can actually feel myself growing numb with each day. Even the repercussions Iâd have with suicide arenât enough to deter me anymore, even with how selfish it sounds, I donât really.. care that people who love me will be hurt anymore. And itâs terrible to say. But I feel so. So fucking miserable..
I know I think differently from most people and itâs a curse, I think I might have some fucking.. disorder because no one seems to function the way I do. And Iâm not saying this to seem smart or edgy but Iâm just.. not right. 
Iâve been in therapy for years and years, a majority of my life.. and they all say the same thing. âIt gets better. Everyone gets sad. Iâm here for you.â But in reality theyâre paid to say that, they say that to everyone, everyone says the same fucking thing but they donât really mean it and even if they _do_ it makes no difference because I genuinely donât want to live 
I have horrible crying spells and canât make it through a single day without breaking down. I canât do school and I donât want to. All I want to do is die and rot. "
Psssssst....... I need a favour Please go wish u/peter-Grlfln a happy birthday
I don't think any of us actually wanna stop living but just wanna go back to a time where we didn't wanna die..Being in such a fragile state for so long can lead us to believe some things our conscious know isn't true..
"Do people still think there is a 'heaven' and 'hell' where they go after they die? I mean logically we are just biochemical matter that disintegrates to smaller molecules when buried??

If you are religious, I hope I am not offending you."
"A day does not past I wish I wasnât aliveI feel like everything is pointless. I have been in therapy for 1.5 years now (was in previously and took a âsabbaticalâ as I thought I was better) and do not feel like Iâm improving mental health-wise at all. I have tried switching therapist to ones more centered around my needs like trauma coping and such, but that seems to be a dud, too. 

Iâm really feeling hopeless and want to stop trying. Not a day goes by where I donât wish I were dead. I wish I had the courage to end it all and have tried in the past. I think thatâs why I donât do it. To attempt and fail is a wake up call for me in the sense that I want to make sure I do it right next time. 

I honestly feel like itâs the only way to take away the pain."
"I'm beginning to formulate a plan. The end may be near.I don't know why I'm posting this, really. I guess it's to feel the only thing I truly wanted before ending my life. I wanted to feel like someone cared, but more than that, I wanted to feel love. I wanted to be a teammate to someone and lift them up while they do that for me. I don't really see that in my future, and I don't want to work towards a future anymore. I'm too fucking lonely to keep going. Everything is too fucking hard. I'm going to make it easy for myself to give up.

My plan is to collect the inheritance I'm owed by the state, notarize a will to leave it to someone I love, and use a suicide bag to cease to exist. At least in this way, someone I care about will benefit from my death, I will no longer be a burden on others, and I won't have to feel the pain I deal with on a daily basis.

The method will be painless and without a sense of panic. I'll simply slip away and be gone forever. No one needs to worry about any suffering I'll feel because there will be none; I'll be stopping all pain forever.

I refuse to blame the world for the way that I feel and to attempt to take revenge on an unfair world. All I ever wanted was love, and I never really got it the way I wanted, but that doesn't mean I need to take that out on the world. The world doesn't owe me love. I never should've existed to begin with.

I guess I'm posting here for a number of reasons. Mainly, I want to leave something somewhere so I can get these feelings out and have them somewhere just in case I actually go through with it.

I've been considering this for a while now, and I'm getting closer and closer to doing it. There's a few things I need to arrange, but they're things that are going to happen whether I do it or not. That will only make it easier for me to do it.

I wish things could've turned out better, but I don't know if I can see myself ever being happy. And if I can be happy, I don't know that I want to go through all the bullshit in order to get there.

All I wanted was to love and to be loved. All I wanted was to have a teammate, friends, and a job that could provide a moderately decent existence. This seems more and more impossible/difficult. I feel more and more that I just want to give up.

I'm probably going to kill myself no matter what; the question is if I'll do it now or when my body begins to give in. I don't know if I want to suffer the emotional pain until my body decides it's time to go.

I'm on the edge, and I may not survive."

After nearly four years of the save file existing I finally 100% complete Batman Arkham knight When I finished the main story and side missions I thought âthere are too many riddles Iâm not gonna do thatâ but over the years Iâve gotten a couple and recently I decided that I was finally gonna finish one of my favorite games and I did it and it felt so good
"Why shouldn't I kill myself?I am a 19 year old gay closeted (almost?) Adult that has severe anxiety and depression with no forsee able future, I have no friends (that live by me that I can talk to), nobody loves me it seems, no medication seems to help me and plenty more. I'm In university and will graduate(if I don't kill myself before) with no debt, I should be happy, but all I can think about is death. I cut myself for the first time today and felt nothing. Why should I live when I don't want to?"
"Today was the closest I've ever come to doing itThis morning I drove out to this mountain near my house to watch the sunrise and wait for my nearest gun shop to open at 9. My plan was to buy a handgun, hopefully something not too expensive, drive to the nearest police station, and shoot myself in the temple in the parking lot. That way at least someone more prepared for it would find me.

I always promised myself that before I did it I would call the suicide hotline just to see what they had to offer. Honestly, it was kinda disappointing, but it still helped a lot to actually talk about my insecurity and fears without just getting some cookie-cutter, fake response. After that, I decided to sleep in my car for a while since I only had 4 hours of sleep last night. 

I'm skipping all of my classes today which sucks, but it's better than killing myself I guess. I can't afford to call off work so I still have to take a shower and all that stuff.

I don't know why I'm posting this, I think I just wanna get it off my chest since I can't tell my family or they'd freak out, and I'm worried about alienating myself from the few friends I have once they find out how depressed I am."
Why is it so hard!!!? :(I can't keep fighting anymore... I'm tired and hurting and alone and overwhelmed!! I have the bottle of pills and the letter is written. I need the pain to go away now. 
"About to get wasted on a Sunday afternoon and see what happensIâm so sick of this empty, hollow feeling. Feeling anxious and afraid simply because you know you have nothing to look forward to or live for. Life has been a constant struggle just to be okay. I want to be happy, but it seems so far out of reach. I will never be good enough and I just see a grotesque monster in the mirror anyway. "

Compared to what I've seen, she's the best human being alive today. She's the only thing ridding myself of this endless feeling of misery and pointlessness. I can't let anyone I know about this. Because society is corrupt, and if they get remotely concerned, they'll take me away from her. I just know it. If she dies I WILL kill myself.

"My father lost a trial to our healthcare company and I just hate my lifeNotes:

English is not my native language, so sorry about that.

I am from Argentina, so before suggesting anything, take that in mind.

I just want to release a lot of pain. Sorry if this is not the place for that.

This is the first time I write something like this. Sorry for the format, rambling and/or writing a lot.

&amp;nbsp;

My family environment is really toxic. I didn't had a good childhood. My father and brother are really aggressive persons, so violence is, unfortunately, something very common.

My mother has OCD, Frontotemporal dementia and Cycloid personality. Basically, her brain is degenerating and her faculties are reduced. She's been sick for the past 8 years, give or take. The four of us lived all together and my father and brother treated her REALLY bad. Verbal abuse, low physical violence (no more than shaking her and stuff like that).

After years, my father followed my advice and started a procedure with our healthcare company so she could go to a special clinic for people like her and the healthcare company didn't approve it even when my mother's psychiatrist wrote a letter saying that she needed to live there because her sickness was very advanced. So my father started a legal procedure with this company.

A first judge decided that during the months before the trial, my mom had to be moved to this clinic and this company had to pay everything. During the last few months (since the start of the year, aproximately), she lived there and came to my place during weekends.

Today, I found out that my father lost the trial because my mother didn't sign something or something like that, so the healthcare company wants to stop paying everything, she'll have to come back to home and we will owe them 60.000 dollars to pay lawyers, trial, etcetera.

This means my mother will come back home, the environment is going to be shit again, we are going to owe an amount of money that we cannot pay and I just hate everything and want to die.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

"I wanna say I do have it bad but I wanna know if Iâm âentitledâ in a sense Iâve been struggling for the past 3 years debating whether or not I actually have it bad, when I first had the worst thing in my life happen to me being the NWMS school shooting and NHS bomb threat my life started going down hill. Iâve had constant arguments with family and recently my parents got divorced and Iâve been left with the my mom who constantly complains about everything and yells at me and my other sibling. And then I look on the fact that she supplies me a bed and home and sometimes food but sheâs absent on everything else in my life. She yells at me and just verbally assaults me and my sister when we do something remotely wrong and on top of that sometimes our grandma has to buy us food because my mom doesnât go to the grocery. So I wanted to ask all of you if Iâm really entitled or Iâm batshit crazy even giving my life the benefit of the doubt and saying Iâm entitled"
"Battling my own thoughtsFor as long as I can remember Iâve always had the thoughts of ending it. I have always just pushed them aside, battled through it on my own. Iâve never really talked to anyone about it, I talked to my partner (now ex) about it a little bit, she always told me that she would be there, we were together for 8 years. Now she says she doesnât love me, this hurts me a lot, all I want to do is end it, end my life, not because of the break up but because Iâm not sure I can do this anymore, Iâve been like this a long time. I finally went to my doctor about how Iâve been feeling, but she wants me to feel the pain of the break up, I told her that Iâve been this way for a long time for as long as I can remember still nothing. I went to a therapist but I feel like she just thinks itâs because of the break up. I admit the break up has triggered it back, but this time itâs worse. I sit and stare into thin air how Iâm going to do it. I then think who is going to find me, how long will I be dead for before someone finds me, I think about my ex and how much it would hurt her, I donât want her to feel like itâs her fault I donât want her to find me. Itâs not her fault, itâs mine I shouldâve got help a long time ago, itâs to late now. "
"I'm just done.I just want to be done living. I can't take all the letdowns anymore. I'm drifting away from my friends, my best friend doesn't care about me, my grades are going downhill, my family is disfunctional. I'm gaining weight from just laying around and never doing anything. I hate myself. I'm ugly and socially awkward. I know deep down that no one cares about me except maybe five family members. And I think it's so unfair that people's lives are so much better than mine. My family is having a really rough time with money. And the one thing I truly hoped for, which was that the guy I practically love feels the same way, was taken away from me. I'm not even friends with him anymore. I think my mom is mentally abusive towards me.

I'm sorry thi is so scattered but I just have no where to turn. I hate living. I don't hate living, but I hate my life. I want to kill myself. If I had a gun, I would not hesitate to blow my brains out. The only thing that's stopping me is fear of the pain."
Anyone wanna be my valentine? I'm a dude. I'm 17. And I'm lonely.
"Things Didn't Get BetterI posted here back in 2015 or 2016. At the time I was living in old trailer in the woods without plumbing or electricity. My only help and transportation to get food or showers was an abusive family member. I'd pinned everything on getting my driver's license and being able to get a job and then improve my life. 


I of course failed the driver's exam and was banned from further attempts since my state doesn't allow more than 3 attempts.


Today nothing has changed much. I have a job I love but it doesn't pay much but I still can't drive and am helpless and dependent on an abusive relative. They verbally rip me apart and destroy my things. When I stil had to physically go into work they would threaten to withold rides from me, and now that I work from home because of the pandemic, they will make louds calls talking about slurs and rape and things when I'm supposed to be taking calls from customers.


Nothing has changed or gotten better. I'm still helpless and abused. I actually developed a brain mass that damaged my vision. I have carpal tunnel or arthritis and have lost all my hobbies (drawing, gaming) as a result. My abusive relative wastes the money I earn--I pay all our bills, they don't work. My brother, the person I loved most in the world, killed himself a year and a half ago. I feel like it's just an inevitability before the abuse drives me to do the same. 

I did manage to live on my own for a year and a half. And I never managed to make friends, except for one person who would not openly be my friend because ""my ex will think we're sleeping together"". What does it say about me that the only person who would willingly be around me will only do so in secret?

I just cant believe how helpless and easily controlled not being able to drive makes you, and there's basically no one way out if you don't have a supportive family or friends to loan you a car and help you practice. Society doesn't care at all that it's basically condemned people to die or live as helpless victims their entire lives. 

I hate this. And I see no way out."

Is it possible to convince the mods of r/teenagers to add a satire flair ? I believe itâll end up being really helpful/useful and it should really be considered. I know the meme flair already exists but it doesnât give the same effect as the satire flair would. Itâll also clear up any confusion of whether the person is serious or not. If any mod reads this please thing about it
"Is the suicide hotline worth calling?I don't have anyone in my life I am willing to turn to or open up to, but I'm tired of letting all my emotions and suicidal thoughts bottle up. I've considered calling the suicide hotline but I've read some stories on the internet where its just made things worse for people. Have any of guys had any experience with it, if so was it worth calling?"

"Teachers logic .... (My maths teacher) ""I already told you that I will not tell you again, study yourself."" Or ""I already told that question, i will not repeat it again, can't you listen?""

So by this logic, a policeman would say, ""I already caught that theif, i will not catch it again, so do it yourself.""

A firefighter would say, ""I already put the fire off in that place years ago, i will not do that again. So take care of it yourself.""

And doctor would say, ""I already treated you, why would you come back? Go, i will not do it again.""

Sometimes I can't even believe why they are even taking money for."
"I have no one and im selfish.ive been battling depression for so long and i just dont know what to do anymore, i just want to die so badly and get away from this lonely hell. but i cant because my daughter would be alone and i know my parents and sister would be hurt. but i have no one to talk to and i keep cutting. im on medicine but it doesnt help. i have social anxiety so i have no one to talk to. im so lost. Too many things have happen these past 4 years for me to just live with this depression like i normally do."
"Whatâs the alternative to death.Really, I feel like everything Iâve done for the past year has been with the thought of Iâll be dead by then but Iâm still here. Now though, all the consequences seem to be catching up and I really donât feel thereâs an alternative than to do it. Iâm scarred of it but Iâm just as terrified of not doing it. Itâs like Iâm trapped."

"Ok I'm kinda getting scared now I went to Walmart to go buy a soccer ball which is in the sports section (duh) and right next to the sport section is the gun section (merica) and there was a line of around 9 persons to buy guns.

 This was in Houston Texas by the way"
"Counting pillsI've been depressed among many other mental health diagnosis since I was 13 years old. I am now 30. All my life I've had to struggle and fight for the things I wanted. Nothing has come naturally to me, I always feel like I'm grinding against life. 

2016 was quite possibly the worst year of my life. Not only did I suddenly lose a parent to cancer but I also had a complicated injury that put me off work for a while and in a very poor financial situation. 

This year at the anniversary of my parent's death it was like it was happening all over again. I had night terrors and a horrible feeling of pain and anxiety. Due to the nature of my work I didn't feel comfortable talking about it to anyone and therefore I didn't receive any support. 

Speaking of work, im at the point now where I think that they have it out for me so badly that if I mess up one more time, I'm likely to be fired. The evidence is mounting due to some vengeful coworkers and mistakes that occurred during the anniversary month (as I said above). I have zero friends there. I dread going into work. It's gotten to the point where I have no confidence in myself because they keep telling me I suck at well everything pertaining to this job. Despite my willingness to train and retrain and to come in all the time for extra shifts. I get no recognition when I'm doing well. It feels like if I don't get out soon I will have a mental breakdown or be fired.

I am worried about money, about losing my job which is the main form of financial support for my boyfriend and I. I feel inadequate and not good enough. I feel worthless and like nobody likes me. 
I feel as though there's no way my life could get better from this point and that maybe my personality leads me to get into these situations where I'm treated this way.

I attempted to get help by going to an ED but the inpatient unit was full and the ED staff treated me like I was unimportant and a piece of shit. (I'm not discouraging others from seeking help there). So I ended up talking the doctor into letting me go home with some meds and referrals to see someone outpatient. So they did do something for me but I just don't feel any better. My outpatient appointments are for next week but I need the help now. 

I want to die ...

I spent the last 10 days looking for ways to kill myself and at first was fearful of the pain but now I'm more focused on how to make sure I'm successful. I've overdosed on pills a lot of times but  never was successful but it seems like the only thing I have at my disposal. I'm not even sure if I have enough. But I figure if I take enough pain killers and then down a bunch of Ativan I'll pass out and won't feel anything. 

So that's where I'm at now... counting pills

"I want to end my life.I want to end my life. I don't know how to do it as I've never attempted, but I've had thoughts and I've come to the conclusion that I now want to make this a reality. I've never self harmed and I've never made plans. I can't do this life thing, it's just not worth it anymore.

I need help for quick ways to do it. Pain is not a factor I am worried about.

I've struggled with social acceptance, bullying, a dysfunctional family in addition to very few friends - even fewer who understand and accept what I'm going through in my life. I was diagnosed 4 years ago with Major Depressive Disorder and Social Anxiety and despite my own and others attempts to counteract their effects these conditions prevent me from functioning in society.

A year ago my dad died suddenly, and everything took a turn for the worst.
Just two weeks ago I was kicked out of home. I've never been able to find my feet.
People say I don't try hard enough, or I'm looking at situations wrong. I try as hard as I can handle. I may be looking at a situation 'wrong' in others opinions but for someone like me I can't see it any other way. If there's a bad situation I cannot forsee positives coming from it.

I'm so tired of trying to explain myself to people who question why I can't do things like a 'normal' person. I'm tired of arguing that when I don't want to do something I mean it. I'm tired of my heart being broken by people I thought I could trust but drag me through thorn bushes. I'm especially tired of the lack of respect in this world for peoples views.

I hate my life and I hate this world. I don't want to be here anymore. I don't care who I hurt, because finally they may understand the hurt that I've been through. I don't feel welcome here and nothing feels right.

I've always been told that suicide is not the way. But what if there's no other way out? A friend said I was being selfish for wanting to commit suicide... it's wrong to say that to someone because it usually makes them feel bad. But it made me feel angry and more compelled to die.

I have a guinea pig. He has probably a maximum of 3 years left in his innocent little life. If he dies before I do I will be even more alone than I am now. If I die before he does, he will surely die if I don't find somewhere for him to go.

If I am successful in my attempt and this post is found by anyone I know, I leave all of my belongings to my friend Petra, and thank her for doing her best when no one else would. Unfortunately my dear, there's only so much you can do, and you won't always be there for me... and that's what I need."
"I want it all to be overI feel like I'm trapped in a glass cage,chained up by guilt,loneliness, sorrow and self hatred. No matter how hard I try to escape I'm trapped. Its my fault my families in this situation. It's my fault I'm alone.I want it all to end.I want this never ending horror movie to end!!
And the thing is I know they all blame me but I don't blame them.if I wasn't such a chav and had a crush on someone I wouldn't be in this situation.


I just want to die."
